"There are alot reasons to keep our the despised method of choosing the President. The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, in the text its states that ""The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Another example from the text is ""Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.

Another reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that ""It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.""

Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.""So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.

And Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example ""Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.

In Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Driving smart cars that drive by themself has it's pros and cons. People can come up with a great deal of reasons on why we should or shouldn't have them. Every time someone thinks of the furture they think of fyling cars, cars that drive by themself. But is the furture really that far away from having driverless cars? Should people be allowed to drive cars that drive themself? In my argument against the development of these driverless cars you will hear the pros and cons having this and why we should or shouldn't have them.

First let's start off with the pros of having driverless cars. One would have to be that it would save a ton of fuel, and protentionly help the earth as the yers go by. Driverless cars could also save a bundle of car wrecks everday. By limiting the careless drivers that are in a hurry to get places or not paying attention. Another pro is that it would help people that would be killed by drunk drivers. It would bring down the numbers of death due to car wrecks. It would save a mass of time on the roads for people who are traveling, because there would not be tons of traffic jams due to the lack of car wrecks becasue they won't be in a hurry and driving wreckless.

Now for the cons of having driverless cars. For starters it would cost a bundle of money to make all these smart cars. What if you don't want to get a smart car that drove itself, would you have to? Also would everyone get rid of there old cars and where would they go? Another thing is as a mass of us know technology does not always work when we want it too and is not always on our side. So the car could stop working on us. In the article it said that they made a road that was smart, but that would cost way to much money to replace all the roads and a ton of time spent doing it. The whole car would relay on sensors that could go out at anytime, whenever they wanted to, and however they wanted too.

In my personal argument, I would not trust a car that could give out at anytime it wanted to nor would I want to. Another reason it would cost way to much money to make. Although it could save a big deal of car wrecks due to wreckless drivers, the cars could be just a dangerous. As I stated before technology is just something that is unexpected and you can't really relay on it.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Principal,

I believe that students at school should not be allowed to have cell phones at school. I have noticed that some female students carry around purses. In class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside. Other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones. This may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone, in the students pocket, has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall. The inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game, texting, or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch. It causes a lot of loud noise, and yelling, as well as theft of cell phones once in a while. This makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school, for contact with a parent or guardian. I believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time.

Look at some more facts. The majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students. It seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats. Male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time. This also applies to a large majority of female students. I think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges. It causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades. Please take my letter into account.

"Dear Principal,

Community service should not be required by all students. Although community service is a wonderful thing, service should never be forced. I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it.

Forcing someone to do service defeats the point of it. When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it.

Teenagers don't like it when they are told what to do. It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.

Another reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time. If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship.

Therefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.

Thank you for your time,

"My argument for the development of the driverless cars is that we should have them. These cars should be allowed to be made, they can become really helpful to people. They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.

First of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.

Second, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.

Last, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.

The driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.

In conclusion, the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Studying Venus is dangerous but there is good insight we can find in this.

First,In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author says ""Earth's ""Twin"", Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". Since it has a lot in common with Earth it is good to have a litle insight on this planet. In the article it says that"" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sich as valleys, moutains, and craters"" this shows how much Earth and venus have incommon. This also gives us an opertunity to take a planetary visit to Venus in the future. Despite the dangers it could cause on someone.

Next, in the reading it says that Venus has"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxid blankets"" This is one example of how dangerous Venus is. In the article is says"" Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperatue of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun"" This is another example of how dangers Venus is. However going to Venus is not a bad idea beacuse life form could have been there in the past. People believe life forms could have existed beacuse of the examples like caters, moutains, and valleys. Despite Venus being the hottest planet in our solar system.

Then, on that note Venus is not the cloestet planet to the sun but has the highest tempature than all of your planet's in the solar system. However studying Venus can give us insight on what to make to prevent for somone or something burning on its surface. While we have been studying Venus all we have seen is a look from a ship orbiting above the planet, that gives us little intel on it surface. We get little intil from that beaucse "" most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere"". However if scientists seeking to conduct Venus will have to get closer to the planet.

Lastly, in the reading it says"" Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"" but not all people know that Venus is not a star it is a planet. However to a amateur stargazer it may just look like another star. Venus is called Earths twin beaucse of how alike they are in distance. Some scientist think this is intersting and want to look into this planet despite the dangers of it. Some scientist have looked into Venus but only have sent unmanned trips. The reasoning is the ship would only last a new hours at the most on Venus.

In Conclusion,Venus is a every intersitng plaet to look into. Despite the dangers it can cause.                ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Technology in society is constantly innovating and becoming more complex. Over time, different manufacturers have tried to create successful, driverless cars. People have mixed feelings towards this for many reasons including safety and control. However, these people are not thinking about the greater outcomes of what could happen with these innovative cars. Overall, driverless cars would be very beneficial to society and the world.

Driverless cars can open up many new windows for society. Companies like Google are already experimenting with this. Since there is not legislation completely prohibiting the use of semi-autonomous cars in California, Google has taken advantage of this by using their cars to aid them in mapping the world. They have used their driverless cars to help gain more info for Google Maps. Society will gain more information about the surrounding land. This is just one possibility with these new cars.

Along with gaining new information, driverless cars can help people multitask. This is also prevalent with Google Maps. As the car scans and takes pictures of the land around it, the person in the car is able to track down and record the appropriate data. People will be able to do more with driverless cars which is more efficient. This will benefit large companies as they will be able to do more with their time. However, for many this leads to problematic thoughts. People are in fear that these cars will have safety problems and that humans will lose control. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author discusses this possible problem thouroughly. There is common misconception that driverless cars will be completely automatic, but this is not the case. Driverless cars are more for assisting rather than they are for driving. The person in the car still needs to remain alert in cases where they might need to take over. This shows that the car does not have complete control.

Another major concern is whether or not these cars are entirely safe. In the article, the author also mentions how the in-car system itself is a safety feature. The article mentions how manufacturers hope to bring in in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Anytime the person needs to take over the car, these displays can be turned off instantly. This is something that is not availables to drivers who are texting while driving. This shows how these driverless cars may even be safer than regular, self-driven cars.

To conclude, one of the greatest reasons that society should move forward with this innovative idea is that this groundbreaking technology can be beneficial in fields outside of automobiles. If engineers can successfully create an automatic car, what else will they be able to produce? More automatic devices could be created with this technology. In this fast-paced world, emptying up time is incredibly beneficial as people will then be able to do greater things. This is something that has been proven to be true since the beginning of time. Innovations such as the printing press, for example, showed this. As technology took over the mundane task of handwriting papers, printers now had more time to complete their own duties. This lead to more efficiency as well as more time for newer innovations. This ultimately helps society as a whole, and this is why driverless cars need to become successful.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have noticed that many people, including myself, struggle to achieve their goals and become the person they truly want to be. This is because people often try to fit into predetermined roles and expectations rather than embracing their unique qualities and talents.

One reason why people may not be happy with their decisions is that they may feel pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations. For example, some people may feel that they need to have a certain job or income level in order to be successful or happy. However, these expectations may not align with their personal values or passions, leading to feelings of unhappiness and dissatisfaction.

Additionally, the world can have a significant impact on people's ability to achieve their goals and become the person they want to be. For example, external factors such as economic conditions, political instability, and natural disasters can make it difficult for people to achieve their goals.

In my opinion, the quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail,"" is particularly relevant to this issue. Emerson encourages people to forge their own path and not be afraid to take risks and make their own way in the world. By embracing their unique qualities and talents, people can achieve their goals and become the person they truly want to be.

In conclusion, people often struggle to achieve their goals and become the person they truly want to be because they may feel pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations or be impacted by external factors.

"Dear Principal,

In the policy containing that students should not have a grade C average to participate in school sport programs that they enjoy or any other school related activities should be changed to having a grade B average.

If you allow them to be apart of something they enjoy and care about then they shouldn't have a grade C average. Students that do what they enjoy and care about such as sports and or school activities should care enough to make the good grades for those activities. Being in those activities and sports is a privilege. Not something that is just given to you. They should care enough to make the required grades if they really wanted to play that sport or activity. Let the student know that they should have better grades in order to play the sport. It's up to them to get that grades to play the game or be in the activity. If they want to continue playing the sport or activity then they should get the grades required such as a grade B average. By telling the students that they should have a grade B average lets them know that they need to work harder to succeed. By working hard to get what they want is a great experience for the student so it teaches them to focus on whats important and be responsible for there work and what they care about. Later in life they may not have much trouble doing what needs to be done and getting it done with ease.

The policy in my opinion should be changed to the requirements of having a B average in order to play school sports and participating in school activities.

"Studying Science and History at Generic_School offers two very different experiences, each with its own advantages. Science is a constantly evolving field, with new advances and techniques being discovered daily. The school provides expert guidance and modern equipment, making it an ideal place to explore the complex theories and technologies of the subject. In contrast, History offers an opportunity to delve into the past and investigate the origins of our civilization and culture. Through lectures and field trips, Generic_School’s expert faculty provides students with a solid foundation of knowledge in the subject while also allowing them to study and discuss unique interpretations of traditional narratives. 

Both Science and History have their advantages, but in the end it comes down to each individual student’s interests and goals. If you are passionate about understanding the complexities of our world, then studying Science is the perfect choice. If, on the other hand, you enjoy delving into the past and uncovering the stories of our ancestors, then History is the subject for you. Whichever path you choose to take, the experienced faculty and resources at Generic_School will provide the guidance you need to succeed and make the most of your studies.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Imagine getting back home from school and sitting on your couch, bored out of your mind, and just waiting for something interesting to come your way.

I know from personal experience, that if kids don't have some sort of extracurricular activity going on they will simply sit and stare at their phone for hours on end.

If schools provide things such as sports, teams, and clubs then it will prevent kids from staring at their phones all day long. I think schools should require some sort of after school activity because it will get them out of their comfort zone, it can be something to look forward to, and it exposes kids the same age with similar interest to eachother.

First, extracurricular activities can help kids get out of their comfort zones. If kids are required to do something then they don't have an excuse not to join a club or sports team. Some students don't do a sport or club because they fear they won't be good enough or may be a burden to the team. However, if they go out and try their hardest they may find that they are a very valued teammate. Some students are shy and more to themselves, but being apart of a group that brings out the best in you is an amazing experience that everyone should experience.

Secondly, kids can look forward to doing something fun instead of going home and doing nothing. For example, when I first moved to Virginia I had absolutely nothing to do because I didn't have many friends. I was very sad and misserable until spring soccer tryouts. Until I started geting new friends, all I looked forward to was soccer practices and soccer games. Soccer really let me release all my stress, forget about everything, and really focus on the game.

Lastly, sports and clubs allow kids the same age to interact. Kids who are more shy can be exposed to kids who share similar interest. Sports especially require team work, which provides a strong bonding experience. I have made so many friends just by being apart of a team and getting close enough to where it is almost a family. Clubs can have the same affect on people.

In conclusion, sports and clubs are an amazing outlet to getting out of your comfort zone, looking forward to doing something, and making new amazing friends. In addition, most students are already involved in an extracurricular activity. It wouldn't really impact the amount of students getting involved in sports or clubs. I think that if schools were to require students to be involved in extracurricular activities it would have a positive outcome.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Over the summer, very few students have the desire to do any homework, especially not a project. In the scenario where a school mandates a summer project, the summer project should be student-designed. Having student-designed projects would make the assignment easier for students to complete and it would also ensure that the students are gaining knowledge from completing the assignment. Assigning a project that isn't grueling and time consuming, as teacher-designed projects tend to be, would result in more students completing the assignment and learning.

Many students never complete projects during the regular school year, and assigning a summer project would seem like an impossible task. However, if the project appealed to students it would be more likely that they would complete it and this could spark a butterfly effect that leads into the next year for those students. It would cause students who don't complete projects or assignments, to turn into consistent, non-procrastinating students. Learning is often made into a very monotonous and dreadful thing but if schools designed learning for students, intelligence would be more spread out across the school. There wouldn't be the groups of ""smart kids"", the groups of ""dumb kids"", or the groups of ""average kids"" and the school, as a whole, would be more successful.

A very typical and repetitive summer project is ""summer reading"". Many schools don't assign this as a mandatory project that is expected to be completed by every student, but is often assigned as a prerequisite to enter high level English classes or to join certain clubs. When the school year begins, a lot of very educated and worthy students are denied the ability to attend that high level class because they haven't completed the summer reading project. Now the logic behind this is, ""If a student can't read one book over the summer, how can they be expected to read multiple books throughout the entire English course ?"". What many people don't take into account, is the fact that regardless of a teenager's intelligence, they will usually neglect all school work until the last minute and end up forgetting. They will either end up not being able to fully put their knowledge to use, or lying about reading in order to enter a class, neither of these outcomes benefit the student.

An argument against these claims would be, ""If teacher-designed projects are assigned, it will be easier for teachers to grade the assignment and this could benefit the student even more by giving them a better grade and better feedback."". Teacher-designed projects are capable of this, and students would be able to receive more well-rounded, and understood grades if the assignment was being graded based off of a rubric. With a teacher-assigned project, teachers can compare each student's work to past projects that have been completed by other students and accurately determine how good the project is. These types of projects ensure that all students will learn the same amount by eliminating the option for students to do projects about something they are already very educated about in their personal life.

Student-designed projects are more reliable and consistent than teacher-designed projects. They allow students to fully display their intelligence and academic potential. They also allow students to educate themselves about a topic. This leads to better learning habits in the future; and overall, it can turn a good student into an even better student. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear State Senator,

On behalf of my right of speech to speak, I think the government shouldn't keep the Electoral College. Because it's a process, without the process of picking out who will be the next president of the United States we would be able too choose a right president, we will choose the light for the people of the United States Of America.

The presidential election is held every four years, you help choose your states electors when you vote for your President, because you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors. During the election, most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that deals with all the electors to the presidential candidates. After the presidential election, The governor prepares a "" Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates running for President in your state with name of their respective electors.

The Electoral College is a process dealing with our founding fathers, whoom which they established it in the constitution as a compomise between the elections of voting for the President in Congress or by popular vote. The Electoral College consist of 538 electors, the majority is 270. Under the 23rd Amendment of te Constitution, the District of Columbia has 3 electos and are treated lke state for a purpose of the Electoral College. In following discussion the word ""state"" also refers to the district of Columbia. Nothing is always good tho, there is always a bad side towards everything. Like in the Electoral College system, voters don't vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect for the President. The single argument against the electoral college is what we might call The disaster factor. State legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, those electors may always defy the will of the people.

They officially say that the electoral collge is unfair because the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without basis in reality. The arguments against the direct elections are spurious at best. The College is regarded as an anacrinism, a non-democratic metod of selecting a president and to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes is the winner. The College restores some of the weight in the poligtical balance that large states lose by virtue of te mal-apportion of the senate decreed in the constitution. They restore some of the weight in te political balance that large states by population may lose by virtue.

The Electoral College avoids te problm of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the voting cast. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate wo nas no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they'll have less incentuve to pay attention to he campaign then rather the President being coosen by a popularity of votes.                                                                                                                              ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principle,

It is obvious that community service is an important thing in a town or city, that benefit the location in many different ways. For example, cleaning up a neighborhood makes it look more appealing, in turn makes for a healthy environment for not only children but for everybody. But, it also depends on who is doing the work for the place and why they are doing the work, some people are required because they are charged with a crime and their sentence was to serve however many hour, days, etc of community service. To me, not only is this the most honest work but this person could pose a serious threat to the community under the circumstances of what they have done. another example would be for school, if getting into a certain school requires a person to have to do a certain amount of community service, that is a very important for not only the student, but it also serves a good purpose for the community. Not to mention, a schoolboy really does not cause someone to fear for their life!

But, there are also many reasons that this boy/girl may not want to part take in community service. Yes, it is a very important necessity for people to be cleaning up their neighborhood but they should not be forced into doing it. Many of the children these days attend extra curricular activities, so depending on what time they ""must"" attend community service, it might take away from other fun things they do fore themselves. Also, if the student is having trouble in school, with or without an extra curricular, forcing them to part-take in community labor would not only hurt their grades in school, but hurting grades means hurting everyone else, even your own family. Think about it, has a mother/father even gotten a bad report about their son or daughter from a school teacher and been thrilled? No, these parents want their children to succeed in school, and succeed in life. Also, what if the child just flat out does not want to engage in a straining activity like so? Maybe they would rather spend time with their family and friends, and get to meet new people. Being socially active is important also.

Aside from many negative effects, there are benefits out of doing community service, more than one at that. For example, most of the teenage population today spends most of their time on Facebook, or the internet mostly. Making the children have to get up and volunteer in physical activities is a good thing for them, getting active and creating a healthy life style. Why spend most of your time at home, playing video games, when you can be out in the world, meeting new people and doing new things? Not to mention, community service really makes a neighborhood shine. In other words, when people are determined to make a change in their town, it not only occupies their time, but other people's time so that they could make it better looking, for all sorts or reasons. Yes, to be honest, community service is a very important thing we need right now, but don't force labor, give these kids a chance, and make it voluntary. Let our voices be heard by an authority with power. Thank you, and goodbye.

"Back in 1976 an image was captured by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. In that time technology wasn't as good as it is now. So the so called Face started to spread quickly. Many people thought that this was created by aliens.

Now first of all aliens haven't been proved real yet, so if aliens aren't real then how can people say aliens did it. In the first image taken in 1976 I can understand why people are creating theories. But if you look at the one taken in 2001 you can clearly see that it is a mesa. Even in 1998, when technology was advancing, you can still see that it is a mesa or just even a type of landform.

"Dear, Principal

I know you have a hard chose at hand and here is maybe some thing to make that chose better. Out of the two policy's I think that policy number one is the one you should chose. Because you would give the students a little bit more freedom to there own lives. And also there are some time situation where students many need to talk to someone or they need to make plans to do something important. Such as one of the rare a cations such as a death of a family member or a close friend. But also it might be some thing different and happens often such as they forgot a project or assignment at home and they need some to pick it up or e-mail it to them so they can get it in on time.

Even this thoughts seem very far fetched they can is still possible they can become true.

"As an artist, I am constantly developing and honing my skills to create something beautiful, meaningful, and authentic. To be able to do this well, I have had to develop a particular talent for observing the world around me and using my creativity to transform it into something special. This process starts when I take notice of the details of the world around me - birds singing, the warmth of sun on my skin, the colors of the evening sky – and is then translated into my artwork. 

Developing and using this skill has given me an ability to capture the beauty of my everyday life as well as a profound appreciation for my surroundings. Knowing how to spot the details, to pay attention to the subtleties of nature and life, helps me to craft powerful, meaningful pieces that express my true self.

In addition to my observation skills, I also focus on the skill of self-expression. The process of creating a piece of artwork often takes me into a mental and spiritual place, where I can express more complex feelings and ideas that would be hard to convey in other ways. This form of self-expression allows me to formerly document emotions, experiences and ideas, in a tangible and creative way that can be shared with others. To make this process of self-expression most meaningful, I try to explore not only my thoughts and feelings, but also my values, goals and aspirations.

Drawing upon these skills have allowed me to make some truly incredible pieces of art, and has taught me to appreciate all the details of life in an entirely new way. By honing my observations and expressing my ideas through art, I have been able to discover my true self and make a strong connection to my life and the world around me.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"During the summer leading up to my eighth grade year, my mom suggested that I get involved in an extracurricular activity because they are very beneficial for kids.

I thought for a while, then took her advice and decided to play on my high school's junior varsity football team.

When the practices first started that July, things were running pretty smoothly;however, once the school year started a couple of weeks later, things got a quite a lot tougher.

I had to learn to be responsible in order to keep up with my homework every day after practice.

As the season went on, I learned a lot of stuff about football and school, but most importantly, I had lots of fun doing it.

I am so glad that I took my mom's advice about extracurricular activities being beneficial to kids because I found that to be true for me as well.

Consequently, I agree with the decision that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

First, I think all students should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches students new, real world skills.

There are countless numbers of valuable techniques in the world today that are never taught within a classroom, but are needed for a successful career.

For example, when I played football, I learned the importance of working together on a team with other people.

When we all learned to work as one team, we started to play really good and win games.

On the other hand, if someone goes all throughout school and never learns the skill of teamwork, it is likely that they will not be very successful when they enter the real world because teamwork is an important skill that is needed in almost every job.

Just imagine if you are a business owner or employer and are looking for a person that you can hire to work for you.

Would you choose the person who was never involved in any type of after school or extracurricular activity, or would you choose the person who was very productive and was involved in many different activities throughout their schooling?

You would probably choose the one who was very involved in their school because that shows you that they have the skills needed to work for you and can keep up with a job.

Secondly, everyone should be involved in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them how to be responsible with their work.

Most kids today don't want to do their homework, and instead only do the fun stuff like play on their phones or lay on the couch like a sleeping bear, which usually results in bad grades.

However, being involved in an activity teaches students that if they want to have fun and stay in their club, they must do their work before anything else.

For example, during football season, I had to be extremely responsible with my schoolwork and grades, or else my coach could have kicked me off of the team.

Similarly, being responsible can also be a key characteristic of getting into college or the workforce.

Just like how you have a low chance of getting hired if you don't have the skills, you have an even lower chance of getting a job if you can't be responsible and maintain your job very well.

Some of the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the most talented or have the most skills, but they are able to keep up with all their work and maintain their position.

Lastly, extracurricular activities teach students how to have fun while doing something productive.

As mentioned earlier, students these days only like to do the fun stuff, not the work.

Extracurricular activities give kids the chance to have loads of fun, but also learn valuable lessons.

As a result of the activities being fun, students will also be more likely to stay in their club because they enjoy it, which helps both the students and the teachers get along better.

Additionally, most students will go away from a class and only remember the fun things that they did in it, while they will forget about all the important stuff.

But in extracurricular classes, the fun parts of the class will usually directly relate to profitable skills or morals, so that when students remember the fun stuff, they will also remember the skills that they learned as well.

For example, one day during football practice, our coach had us do a fun drill where we got to run behind our blockers.

I vividly remember this because it was really exciting when I got to do it, although, when I think about it, I also remember that in order to do it, I had to get low and run with the proper technique.

It was because of fun things like that drill that I was able to stick with the game and improve my skills.

So as you can see, I agree with the decision that all kids should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

Just like how I had to alter my work schedule when I played football, extracurricular activities might not be that easy, but I can promise you that in the long run, they are worth participating in.

So even if you don't think extracurricular activities are good for you, go ahead and just give one a try.

There are all sorts of activities out there that are available to everyone, so all you need to do is find the one that strikes your fancy.

I guarantee that you will not regret it at all!",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME im from SCHOOL_NAME .Some of my friends think having community serves is not a good job because that take time away from what you are doing for that day. For an example u have a basketball game u want to go to it and u have community servas and you cant play because u have community servas.,but i think u should not help the community servos i think u can do something else like recycling.

Another reasons why i think you should not have community servos is because that is tacking time out from your parents from working and from kids doing what they got to do. Some of the reasons why imp saint u should not have community sevens is because if u have to go some were special you have to do community serves have some question i will like to ask, how do it feel like doing community servos its like torcha? How it is in the summer time and you have 2 do that and it is like a 95 degree weather? What made mall come up with the idea of doing community serves? You do that for people who deserve it or what? What is the confluences if u do it or you don't do it?

The reasons why imp asking you all of these questions is because i wannabe know how do the system work with community serves. Also i want to know why is it community servants that's my option for this fit of having community servos.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Texting and driving has been the cause of so many deadly accidents, looking down at your phone for what you think is just a second could change your life forever. So many die every day from a car crashed caused by texting and driving. Whether it's you doing it or someone else on the road it could still change your life forever. Its so sad to think that you could lose your life at any moment while being in a car just riding down the road and get hit by someone that is on their phone while they are driving. If you are in the car with someone and they are on their phone, ask them to put it down... save a life or even your own life.

It's so sad to know that there are people out there that are that selfish to be on their phone while they are driving and not fully understand the consequences of it. The law enforcement here these last couple of years have really buckled down on the no phone while operating a vehicle law. They have just recently passed a law that you cant even have your phone on person while driving. If you get pulled over and you have it anywhere around you, you can get a big ticket. It's not even worth it in my opinion, the text or call can wait.

The newer vehicles are making them now where you can connect them through Bluetooth on your phone and send messages and calls through just saying it over the speaker. I have an older model Malibu, and it doesn't have all of the fantsy stuff but it does have Bluetooth and ""ONstar"" which is where you can call and talk over the phone instead of being on your phone. So many people I know have been in wrecks and the cause of it are phones. Phones are addicting and I want to be on mine all the time, but I know when I'm driving I don't need to be on mine because I can barely focus on the road much less my phone and the road.

My down the line cousin got in a wreck and killed someone for a couple of reasons, one being the cause of having the phone up to his hear. This young girl was coming back from college in Cartersville, and my cousin was driving coming back from his friends house and he wasn't paying attention to see the girl coming and pulled out right in front of her, and killed her. They saw that one of the causes was because of cell phone use and other things that were in his system... and he got charged with vehicular homicide. Which is killing someone while driving. My cousin is not a killer at all but he was on the phone while he was driving and killed someone from not having his full attention on the road.

Cars are really dangerous anyway, and hard to control sometimes, and adding a phone in that equation doesn't make sense. Some people do drugs they are illegal, but it's a matter of not caring, and being addicted. That's kind of the same thing about the texting and driving. Some people just don't care, and some just are too addicted to get off of it while they are driving. I'm not saying I am a perfect angel myself because I have been on my phone while I've been driving before but I don't do it often, because I know what it can do and cause, and that's not what I want at all.

"After conducting extensive research on the effects of a four-day work week on businesses, it has become clear that there are multiple advantages, such as improved focus, flexibility, and job satisfaction among employees. In addition, a four-day school week can provide more time for teaching and more space for students to do their homework. Although there are potential benefits to the change, there are also possible disadvantages. For example, students may miss out on classes or be unable to keep up with the curriculum and homework. It is also worth investigating how inadequate sleep can affect students and how a four-day school week would help address that issue. Ultimately, a thorough exam of the implications of extending the four-day school week has the potential to make significant improvements to the educational experience for students.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"I beileve the tecnology of ""Driverless"" cars is necessary in todays society, and should be used for its worth. One of the few big ideas i saw in the article was the newer use of sensors in the vehicles we use today. Many of the sensors today are used to warn and stop the driver from any collisions or accidents that may accure, at any moment. I beileve that this technology is needed now more than ever for everyone, and not just unexperienced or handicaped drivers. I am currently still learning how to drive and will get my license very, and i am very cautious of my peers driving too. I would feel more comfortable that the car could stop itself wiith out the drivers noticing, and possibly stoping to stop a collision or save my very own life. I would very much like to see this technology come to fruition, and let the world harness it's abilities to further mankind towards a safer and better future.

The laws aginst the use of these ""Driverless"" cars are very reasonable too, and need to adjust for further research towards the safety of the people they aim to protect with these laws. I beileve they dont realize that testing and researching these new methods is a step foward, for safety, and not for just the sake of testing variables on somethings. They don't seem to understand that these technologies are being invented to help save people today. If you searched on the internet for just one second you could find all sorts of stories, about their own cars saving the drivers from creating a terrible mistake and saving their lives. These laws make me question us, as a society, more than ever, and as a society how are we allowed to grow in knowledge and sciences, if we cannot test our ideas? We must further sucome to the new technologies we have available, at this time, but we must not lose ourselves in context. We have to push towards breaking these laws aginst testing and accept the new technology, for the future.

As a child i watched cartoons with flying cars and cities in space, and in todays age we have the ability to strive for this dream of the future. One day I hope to be sitting in a cab that s driving itself perfectly fine and not releasing large amounts of toxins into the air that we all breath, to survive. This is yet another thing to admire of these ""driverless"" cars, and that is the ability to use much less amounts of fuel, rather than traditional vehicles. As you may already know cars pushout lots of burned fossil fuels, but with the new technology that has been presented, these cars can use less fossil fuels. The burning of less fossil fuels is a ""thumbs up"", and has a lesser impact on the world, rather than a world without them.

I gladly accept the new technologies that ""Driverless"" cars have presented to me today, and feel safer knowing a computer system can save me from human errors. I can guarentee that this technology is safe and efficient for the world, and should be further studied to further the new technology to more suit society. The further interest or study in new sensor technology is to thank, just as much as the fuel concerns we have today with our own vehicles. The technology of the future is here, and we need it to help save the lives of many people. We as the society of the future should not stand back and watch the possibilities of our future be restricted by laws, that just dont understand the purpose of this technology. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a significant change in the way we learn and work. One of the most significant changes has been the shift towards online learning. While attending classes in person has its advantages, there are also benefits to attending classes online. In this essay, I will analyze the benefits and responsibilities of attending classes online instead of attending classes in person.

Firstly, attending classes online provides students with more flexibility and convenience. Students can access course materials and lectures at any time, allowing them to balance their studies with other responsibilities such as work or family commitments. This flexibility can be especially beneficial for students who have to work part-time or full-time jobs to support themselves or their families. For example, a single mother who works full-time can attend online classes in the evenings or on weekends, allowing her to provide for her family while also pursuing her education.

Secondly, attending classes online can be more cost-effective than attending classes in person. Online courses often have lower tuition fees and do not require students to purchase textbooks or other materials. Additionally, students can save money on transportation, housing, and other expenses associated with attending classes in person. For example, a student who lives far from the university can attend online classes and save money on transportation and housing costs.

However, attending classes online also comes with responsibilities. Students must be self-motivated and disciplined to attend online classes and complete assignments on time. They must also have access to reliable internet and technology, which may not always be available in some areas. Furthermore, students may miss out on the social interactions and support that come with attending classes in person. For example, students may not have the opportunity to form study groups or connect with classmates who share their interests.

In conclusion, attending classes online has both benefits and responsibilities. While it provides students with more flexibility and convenience, it also requires self-motivation and discipline. However, the benefits of attending classes online can outweigh the responsibilities, especially for students who have to balance their studies with other responsibilities. For example, a single mother who works full-time can attend online classes and provide for her family while also pursuing her education. Furthermore, attending classes online can be more cost-effective than attending classes in person, which can be especially beneficial for students who live far from the university or have financial difficulties.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"As an average 8th grade student, I find the topic of character traits and their development over time fascinating. It's interesting to think about how different individuals can have different traits, and how these traits can be influenced by various factors such as environment, society, and internal factors.

For example, some people may be naturally more outgoing and sociable, while others may be more introverted and reserved. The environment and society can also play a role in shaping these traits. For instance, someone who grows up in a bustling city may be more likely to develop a more outgoing personality, while someone who grows up in a small town may be more reserved.

But it's not just the environment and society that can influence character traits. Internal factors, such as a person's values and beliefs, can also play a role. For instance, someone who values independence and self-reliance may be more likely to develop a more self-sufficient personality.

I think it's also interesting to consider how individuals can change their traits over time. For example, someone who used to be shy and introverted may work on becoming more outgoing and confident, and eventually develop a more extroverted personality. This can be seen in people who undergo personal transformations, such as those who go through a spiritual awakening or who make significant changes in their lives.

However, it's important to note that while people can make changes to their traits, they are not completely in control of them. External forces, such as societal expectations and cultural norms, can also play a role in shaping a person's character. For instance, someone who grows up in a culture that values extroversion may feel pressure to be more outgoing and sociable, even if they are naturally more introverted.

In conclusion, character traits are complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors. While people have some control over their traits, external forces can also play a significant role in shaping them. Understanding how character traits develop over time can provide insight into a person's character and how it develops over time.",1,llama2_chat,1
"In the story the author gives us reasonable decisions on why we should go to Venus. It forms like earth and its clled the Earth? twin sister. The author provides a lot of information. One of them states ¨

may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago,Venus was probably covered laregley with oceans and coul have supported various forms of life¨ this cold very well be a lot like earth. There are sea level just like earth and there ¨ familiar features such as valleys ,mountains,and craters.¨These areall the same thing that Earth has,It also says that this Venus could have very well had ocean covering all of it.

This could go both wasy this could very well be a successful mission or it could be a very dangerous and unsure mission. That are traking research and countinuing finding more ways to make sure that humans will not have any problems while living in Venus.

"The accomplishments of Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare, Ludwig van Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Leonardo da Vinci have had an immense impact on society, leaving an indelible mark on our history and culture. These renowned individuals triumphed over obstacles in both physical and intellectual endeavors, paving the way for ground-breaking discoveries in the fields of science, philosophy, and the arts. What made them stand out was their ability to think outside the box and push themselves to explore unexplored areas. For instance, Newton developed his groundbreaking laws of motion, while Shakespeare wrote some of the most renowned works of literature in history.

Although it is difficult to pinpoint any one factor that led to their success, it is clear that in order for people to flourish intellectually, they must be provided the right combination of stimulation and encouragement. For instance, teachers and mentors can help their students cultivate inquisitiveness and be courageous in tackling new challenges. The right environment can motivate individuals to think beyond conventional methods and put their creative skills to use. Furthermore, knowledge sharing and collaboration also plays an essential role, as it creates an environment wherein the exchange of ideas can result in amazing discoveries.

Finally, while new discoveries can have positive effects on society, they can also have unintended consequences. It is therefore necessary to take appropriate measures to ensure that the process of invention and innovation occurs responsibly. To ensure this, proper research should be conducted before any discovery is put to use, and the consequences must be studied to ensure that they are beneficial to society.

In conclusion, Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare, Ludwig van Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Leonardo da Vinci are prime examples of individuals who rose above their circumstances and pushed themselves to explore new ideas and create lasting change. It is necessary to provide the right combinations of motivation and support to encourage people to think beyond conventional boundaries and make new discoveries. In addition, these discoveries must be made responsibly, with the proper research and precautions being taken to ensure that the changes are in the best interest of society.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Working in a group versus working alone has its pros and cons. Working in a group can be beneficial in many ways, such as encouraging collaboration, providing different perspectives, and improving problem-solving skills. Collaboration can be a great experience as it encourages compromise and provides another layer of understanding. Working in a group can also stimulate the open exchange of ideas among members of the group, resulting in different perspectives from which to consider a solution to a problem. Additionally, multiple minds working on the same challenge can improve problem-solving skills and can create a better work product.

On the other hand, working alone can be difficult because of the lack of collaboration, the stagnant ideas, and the pressure to work at a faster pace. When working alone, there is no one to bounce ideas off of, leading to stagnant ideas as no new perspectives are introduced. Moreover, when working alone, the individual is expected to work at a faster pace and can result in rushed work product.

Working in a group can be especially helpful to students. Working in a group can alleviate some of the pressures associated with an academic project, such as the fear of being the only one who does not understand the material or the fear of not completing the assignment on time. Additionally, working in a group can also promote sharing of resources and responsibility as group members can share the workload and knowledge. Group settings also bring opportunities to ask for help, learn, and build relationships.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Driverless cars have more cons and disadvantages then they do pros and advantages. The author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" presents positive and negative aspects of driverless cars but I really only see the negatives. If there are driverless cars, then there could be a lot more crashes then there already are. Driverless cars are pointless and show a great amount of negatives, show that no one in the car will be paying attention, and there are so many safety issues.

First, there are many negatives regarding driverless cars. Technology in the future may be able to have cars without a driver at all. In the article though, the author states that currently they would not be truly driverless yet. The driver would still need to stay alert and be able to take over when needed, like driving through a work zone or when they are driving through an accident site. When a person is driving a car, they already need to be fully alert and know what is happening around them at all times to stay safe. If we have someone sitting in the drivers seat waiting to have to take control, then what is the point of not driving it when you pretty much need to continue to know what is going on at all times? There is always the fear that something will go wrong and the car just will not work right. This could cause serious injuries and even death to the driver and passengers in the driverless car as well as other cars and people around them. Another issue is that there is a lot of poverty and familes without enough money to buy a regular car. The amount of technology and work needed to make these driverless cars will put The United States of America in even more debt then they already are. As well as many other countries around the world. The cost for these driverless cars are a huge negative that will result in many people not being able to afford to buy them.

Secondly, when the car is driving without a driver but still has a driver in the drivers seat, the driver could be on their phone, reading something, or listening to music and not paying attention then all the sudden the car alerts them that they need to take over but they are not ready and do not know the reason why they are in the situation to take over the car. This could cause crashes and serious injuries to the driver and other passengers in their car, as well as people in cars around them. Nobody can promise that the driver will be able to pay attention at all times when the car is driving itself. It is kind of like having someone in the passenger seat, they are not driving so they are on their phones, reading stuff, and listening to music, not paying attention to the road. Same goes for a driver just sitting in the drivers seat and not driving the car. They could be not paying attention and then all the sudden they are surprised with the need to start driving in a situation they have not been paying attention to. In paragraph eight of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author expresses that they are trying to bring up in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-ups displays. The author states that this could be a safety feature, but who knows that will work perfectly, or that the driver will be entertained by that?

Lastly, the safety issues regarding the driverless cars could be an endless list. If the driver is not paying attention, like I expressed in the pervious paragraph, the issues with safety grow bigger then they already are with actual people driving cars. If the driver has no clue what is going on because they were on their phones, reading something, or listening to music and then suddenly they have to take over, this could cause a crash that could cause serious and minor injuries as well as death. The amount of crashes that happen today with actual humans driving cars are already through the roof, if something messes up with the driverless car, it could be very bad. It is just like how your phone can mess up randomly and stop working, what if that happens to the driverless car?

The author of the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" expresses both postive and negative aspects of driverlesscars. I believe that driverless cars have more negatives than positives and are pointless. They also show many safety issues that can put many people in danger and show financial disadvantages. In conclusion, driverless cars should not be a thing in order to keep everybody safe.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"When you live in the United States, you use cars everyday, so you wouldnt understand the positive impacts of limiting car usage has on everyday life. Some small towns in Germany, Paris, and Colombia are car-free citys. In the passage

In German Susburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , writen by Elisabeth Rosental, She tells her readers that a suburb in Germany, Vauban, has street parking, driveways, and home garages generally forbidden. Rosenthal states that not having a car can actually bring happiness. ""'When I had a car I was always tence. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walker.""

In the second article,

Paris bans dring do to smog , by Robert duffer, he tells the reader about the struggles Paris faced with polution in the air. He states that they made a system where one day they would have even licence plate number stay home one day and the odds would stay home the next. After trial and error, They came up with a solution, And it helped the smog go away. If cars were banned completly the air we breathe would be so much cleaner, and less foggy. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescrind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.""

In the third passage

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , by Andrew Selsky, It talks about a car free day that takes place once a year in the town on Bogota. The passage also states that people hiked, biked, skated, and took buses to work during the car free day. Selsky states that the goal of the day is to promote alternative transportation and reduse smog, Which brings back the fact that not using cars reduses polution in the ait. The other reson banning cars is a good idea is because it redused stess, because you dont have to deal with traffic, find a parking spot, or worry about being late to work because you have to stop to fill up your tank in the morning. ""'It's a good oppotunity to take away stress...' said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza""

The last article the End of Care Culture , written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, talks about how ""americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". i beleive people are finally coming to the state of mind where public transportation is the faster, easier, and more afisiant way. Another reason it is better than having your own cars is that it is safer. ""'...public transpotation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resousrces, lower emissions and improve safety.""

The main advantages of limiting car usages are happiness, lower in polution, lower in stress, and increase in safety.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"DEAR,state senator i argue in favor of keeping  the electoral votes alive to choose for the new turn. people say that the electoral voting system may turn alot of potential voters away from voting for a new president since the electoral voting has been tight on alot of people who don't like to use that way then they want it as a direct election and to abolish the electoral college!

There are alot of ways we can actually save the eletoral voting system .the electoral voting consists of a very non-democratic way so all the voters can decide on a canindate for whoever receives the most highest votes on,in 2000 gore had way more votes than bush but fewer electoral votes on him andthat was since they first ever voting for the presidents back in around 1888 thats a very long time almost 200 years when that happened. basically we need to keep the electoral voting for some practical reasons thta we do not know about now maybe it could be from thedispute over recent years of voting .

"Dear state senator,

I trying to understand why we have the system of choosing our state's electors when you vote for president beacuse when you vote for your candidant you are actualy voting for your candidante's electors. This process is easier for most individuals beacause you do not have to sit in a room, for hours, counting up millions of votes; all you have to do is count up the elector's votes in stead. This process is what our founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. How can you be a qualified citizen, arent we all the same? I know that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. So, another thing that I would like to know is do you believe that this process that has been going on for ages is still a acturate system.

Does voting for people to vote for the president of your choice is a great idea. Does it not seem a bit ludacris that you have to choose your state electors in order for your vote to be counted since you think that who you pick as the electors will actually pick the vote you wanted. Why cant we vote for our won presient, why should we have to go through someone to vote for our president. It has been known that president's may be the popular vote winner, but still can lose the presidency. Why is that? Individuals that vote on their electors can not always control who their electors choose for president. Occasionally, sometimes the electors you pick will not vote for his or her party's candidate; they will cast a vote for whomever they please.

Some of these candidates that people choose are what you call ""faithless"" electors because of the winner-takes-all system. This means that most candidates do not spend time in states they know that they have no chance of winning. Meaning, they only stay focused on the ""swing"" states which in other words means the states that will either go for the person they like or against him. During the 2000 campaign, 17 state had not even seen their candidates at all and the voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not get to see a single campaign ad. So, tell me why we are still using this same system that cheats citizens out of their votes. Is it beacuse we are not qualified citizens?

If you do not already know by now the electoral college is a process, not a place and this process needs to be abolished. Who picks these electors, are they just people like you and I or are they the qualified citizens. They can be anyone not holding an office and the state actually chooses the electors. So, this means that the people really have no place in the president election. The electors are chosen by the state and even if you choose those electors they can go against what you decide and choose who ever they want. What happened to what the people wanted, why are those candidates choosing who runs our country for four years. What did they do so amazing that they get the final say on the matter. No, they are like us so why should we have to go through them just so we can make sure are vote matters in electing the president. Most of America has to deal with making sure are kids are getting a good eduacation, making sure are water or light bill is paid every month, and we also have deal with getting up at seven in the morning working and not coming home untill eleven at night all the while praying that our kids are safe since we could not pay for a nanny. With all of these things worrying us, putting a lot of stress in our minds one of the only things that we should not have to worry about is if our vote is going to count in electing our president. In conclusion, I believe, senator, that we should change our election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear principal,

I believe that allowing student to bring phones to school and using them during lunch period and free time but as long as the phones are off during class time is a bad idea because what if the student don't listen to the policy and they have there phones out during classes and there texting during there class and when the teacher ask what is the answer to ""2836/847 they don't the answer how they be able to learn. Here's an example I think I can bring my phone to school and text, call, go on the internet go on facebook do what ever i want do and if it goes to far. That student will start to fail school and not doing the homework. That student will start going to classes. Then start skip school her so cool and popular. I also believe don't allow student to have phone at school at all is another bad idea because what if student needs to call home call someone else what if a group of student are walking to school and someone got shot how would they call the police if there phones are at home that student will be dyeing right before the other students eye what would you do. So here's policy 3 the student are allow to bring they phones to school but at all time it has to be turned off and in your locker inside your book bag.

"Bullying is a major issue in today's society. It affects millions of people, and it can have severe consequences on the mental and physical health of the victim. Bullying can take many forms, such as verbal abuse, physical violence, and cyberbullying. It is essential to find ways to prevent bullying and offer solutions to those affected by it.

The first step in preventing bullying is to promote respect for each other. Respect is a fundamental human right, and it is essential to treat everyone with kindness and compassion. People should be encouraged to listen to others and understand their feelings and perspectives. By promoting respect, we can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.

Another way to prevent bullying is to educate people about its impact. Many people do not realize the harm that bullying can cause, and they may not understand how to recognize or respond to it. By educating people about the effects of bullying, we can help them identify and address it when it occurs.

In addition to prevention, it is essential to offer solutions to those affected by bullying. For victims, it is important to provide them with a safe and supportive environment. This can include counseling services, peer support groups, and other resources that can help them cope with the emotional and psychological effects of bullying.

It is also important to address the root causes of bullying. Many people bully because they feel powerless or insecure, and they may be seeking attention or validation. By addressing these underlying issues, we can help people find alternative ways to express themselves and build healthy relationships.

Finally, people can have fun without resorting to violence. There are many ways to have fun and socialize without engaging in bullying or other harmful behaviors. This can include participating in sports, clubs, or other extracurricular activities, volunteering, or simply spending time with friends and family.

In conclusion, preventing bullying and offering solutions to those affected by it is essential for creating a safe and inclusive society. By promoting respect, educating people about the impact of bullying, addressing the root causes of bullying, and offering solutions to victims, we can help create a more positive and supportive environment for everyone.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in a world with not a lot of car usage? Imagine never driving but walking or ridding a bike to any place you would want to go to. The mall, grocery store, movies all a small walking distance away. That would be great right? You'd be helping yourself and the world by making you fit and the world's pollution decrees. That sound interesting I feel like the world is slowly coming to a stopping point with car use.

A world with cleaner air is what we would have if everyone limited the use of their cars. According to "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal "" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states."" The United States produces a greater amount of greenhouse gasses. If we limited the use of our cars the United States would have better air making the United States a better place to live. The United States has a very large number of people already pulling away from using cars. According to "" The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal."" Americans are buying fewer cars,driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Cars are not needed for everyday use because people seem to get around greatly.

Limiting the use of you care can greatly help everyone. The United States has a very large amount of unhealthy people. People who don't get to walk or do fitness regularly to be able to stay healthy and fit. Having limited the use of your car it would as help you mentally. In the article ""In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal Heidrun Walter a mother of two says "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" If a mother of two says that not using her car makes her happier. In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" by Andrew selsky a businessman said "" It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution."" So if you ask me the would would be better without using cars everyday it's a win win situation.

People all around the world are taking part in limiting the use of cars. People from Colombia to Pairs to Germany. People all over the word are all trying to help out the world by limiting the use of cars. In the article "" Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky the author talks about how everyone took a ""car free"" This was Bogota's third straight year of no car day the only cars that were allowed to be on the road were those of busies or taxis. The violators that drove their car are faced with a fine of $25. In the text of ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. She says that the worlds car culture is slowly coming to a end fewer people are getting their licenses and more are organizing their social lives and summer jobs around where they could was or take a buss to.

The world is on a better path with people trying to limit the use of their cars. The world gets better and so do you. In the articel ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" by Andrew Selsky says that the business in the small town have also boomed "" Parks and sports centers also have boomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restraints and up scale shopping districts have cropped up."" So if everyone limited the use of their cars the everyone would win. So what comes now that the world is limiting the use of cars?    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Wyat Gibson, former scientist from NASA, 1976. Today, spacecraft one has captured a image to what looks to appear as a face. Scientist figured it was just another Martain mesa. ""Only this one photo had unusaul shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharoh."" I predicted that it must have a degree of surpise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion lab when the face appeared on the monitiors.

Some other scientist belived the face was an alien artfact. I snapped a picture ten times sharper than the oraginal Viking photos. I have done lots of reaserch, and revealed a natural landform. I reasched the photo a lot more. After a lot of rearch, I decoved that there was no alien monument after all.

We decieded that we still did not have enough evedience. Perhaps, alien markings were hidden by haze. Still there is no evedience as we continued. After more and more reasch. There is still no alien monument.

We decovered that the picture is acually the Martian of a butte or mesa. They are landforms common around the American West. It's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about that same height as the face on mars. In the end, there was not evedience of alien lifeform or artcraft.

"Dear principle,

I think community service is very important to our city because many cities are filthy and dirty and need cleaning, if we can get the whole school to do it, it would be great, and it would also become a good opportunity for our city, but i don't think it would be fair if the whole school is forced to do it, i would prefer if you were to make a list so people are free to sign up if they want to join community service.

Another example why community service shouldn't be highly instructed is because some kids might have some important things to do at home and might not have free time to help the community. Also not many kids have time to help because of all their homework and chores they might have at home.

The list would be an excellent idea because the people that sign up would most likely have time to help and would probobly be dedicated to doing community service. Although not many people would be doing community service you would know that the people that signed up are a dedicated group of people and would be glad to help.

Many people don't know all the pollution that is out there is killing animals and slowly destroying our planet' soon our planet will be completely a mess and would be a horrible place to live. Many people don't believe in global warming but there has been some evidence of global warming. One piece of evidence is there has been a major decrease in water. The water level is lowering and will soon be completely gone, witch will then lead to death.

Many people argue about this but all this pollution is doing a lot of harm to all the living things in the world. these are some of many reasons why we need community service so i hope you take my advice and use it for future reference.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Cars are becoming a must in today's society. In some places, people live and survive without a motorized vehical. People don't have to stop using cars altogether, but should be able to limit themselves to save of world from pollution creating a better environment to live in.

Some people don't understand the severity of pollution and how much cars contribute to that. Pollution is said to become Earths demise, whith cars producing and letting out so much smog, it seems as if the Earths demise could be near. According to Robert Duffer, Paris has ""enfored a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This evidence of Paris giving a partial ban shows how detrimental cars can have on Earth environment. Further examination reveals, a situtation where Bogota has even issued a "" car-free day"" stated by Andrew Selsky. This source shows us that with even one day without using a car could be a useful plan for all places. People of today don't need to not use their cars, just use their cars either less per day or per week.

Although some may say, we need cars to get to work or to go to the grocery store, they can always just use public transportation. Buses are already running even if you are in a car so why not use them instead of polluting the air even more. In Bogota, when they have their car-free day, most people either ""hiked"",""biked"", ""skated"" or ""took buses"" as a mean of transportation. More evidence shows a senario where the Environmental Protection Agency is encouraging a ""car reduced"" community, stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Resources such as this one shows that if the United States Evironmental Protection Agency is concerned about our pollution rate why shouldn't we? If we cut down on our use of cars, pollution rate can drop extremley down causing a better living environment.

When you stop to think why cars have become so prevelant, there is no exact reasoning. If we don't even know our exact reasoning for having a car, in a case that we can't rely on buses or our own two legs to provided why are we risking the safty of our Earth in order to use them? Cars aren't the slighest bit the problem, how and how often we use them is becoming the problem, if we limit our use of cars our advantage would be the single best thing in live, happiness and peace of life.             ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Summer is a time for students to relax with the little time that they have off from school. Some people think that kids do nothing over the summer, and they forget everything. Which is not beneficial for when they come back to school. Even teachers having the authority to assign summer projects is not okay in my opinion. If their has to be projects done over the summer it would be better for them to be student-designed.

The whole point of a ""summer break"" is to not have to do any work, we finally have time during the week to do other things then go to school. By not doing work over the summer you are not forgetting everything you learned because some of the stuff we actually use in out everyday lives. And even if we don't, we still wouldn't forget we would just need a little refresher on some topics. Which is what most schools do anyways when the kids get back. And even if we did the project at the beginning of the summer, most students wouldn't remember what the project was on. If the teachers were given the authority to assign the summer projects most kids would not do it. Some would forget, or simply just not want to because it is summer break. Kids are traveling and don't always have the time to be focusing on school. Even if parents were contacted about this workload, I believe that students will take it upon themselves to not to it at all. If there was an option to do summer work or not I feel that, the students that want to do better will do that work. Maybe having a prize, extra credit, an automatic test exemption, or something would influence students to pick their choice wisely.

A student-designed project would be the best option out of those two things. Because as students we don't like to feel restricted on what we can and can't do with all of the guidelines. Student-designed projects could benefit each person and make every student feel more comfortable with what they are doing These projects would be a great thing to start off the school year with because they could be about their summer break and what they did. And instead of the ice breaker games that everyone in each class has to do, they could simply just share their project that they decided to do over the break. This option would also be a huge stress reliever on the teachers workload, with deciding what each person has to do.

Some people would say otherwise. That the kids need projects to keep them on target for the year. Or to already be practicing for their classes for next year. That it can only benefit us in our life. Parents could say that they will make time for their children work and remind them of what they have to do for school even on the break. Also that teachers guidelines would restrict the work to something appropriate, or meaningful to school.

In the end I feel that it is all up to the students and what they want to work on. Because as highschoolers self accountability is a real thing. The school already provides summer school and sol remediation over the summer for free that you can sign up for. So if a student is worried about their grades in a class or wants to get ahead they already can through those programs. Or even taking classes outside of the school with tutors. These projects could be a really good and efficient thing or a stressful unmotiving thing. And that would be all up to the school and administrators.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear principal

I agree we should clean up the entry school in end up clean like a whistle. The principal should lets take some breaks once for a while. When school is over we should stay at school until 5:00 p. m. therefore cleaning up the liter and stuff off the ground and throw it away in the trash can. We should have a break at 3: 50 to 4:15 p. m. that gives us plenty of time for a break.

But, let some people to go home so they can watch some of their favorite shows and play their video games. Once for a while they will come back help us because they did all their chores and their's nothing on TV. I will go home because I have to do chores and feed my animals. Plus sometimes I might have a bad day and want to get away from people. In a few minutes I would get over with it come back to school to make it better.

I don't want anybody to come to this school and say "" This school doesn't look right because all this litter and trash all around the campus "", I would get up change the school picking up piece by piece unit it the cleanest school in Jefferson Davis County. We also need to clean the walls , decorated the school parking lots and cafeteria. We should build a new break room full with snack bars, soda machines, and rooms for people so they can talk on break. It would be good if you give us a break between Ist and 2nd. We could reorganize the gym because a lot people are trash behind after the game is over. We could put a trash can on the stands so the when the people leave out the gym it would be a little clean.

"Phones and Driving

Over 400,000 casualties occur annually due to distractions while driving (Vegega, pg 3). Many of these distractions are due to phones, an ever-growing distraction for drivers. Due to this risk drivers should not be able to use phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because of the growing threat towards drivers and pedestrians and potential cost of damages.

Since recent years phones have been a more common distraction for drivers. Growing distractions such as the usage of cellular devices poses a threat to drivers. From 2012 to 2015 crashes involving cell phones have increased by 15% from roughly 60,000 to 69,000 (NHTSA, pg 3). Therefore the usage of cellular devices while driving has led to a growing threat for drivers. Furthermore, distractions while driving also poses a risk to pedestrians. Of the 3450 fatalities in the US during 2016 caused by car crashes due to distractions 462 (13%) are pedestrians (NHTSA, pg 3). This means distractions such as cell phone usage put pedestrians at serious risk when a car crash occurs. Overall, cell phone usage while driving poses a growing danger toward drivers and pedestrians.

Phone usage while driving can cost vast amounts for both governments and drivers. Damaged caused by crashes due to distractions is expensive to replace or repair. In 2010 the cost of damage due to distracted drivers was $22 billion, which is about $26 billion in 2019 (Vegega, pg 3). This data reveals that car crashes due to distractions cost countries billions to remedy, an expense which far outweigh any positives. In addition, drivers also risk paying fines for cell phone usage. In states such as Delaware fines can cost upwards of $50 and come with court fees upwards of $100 (Chaudhary, pg 3). This means that drivers can face severe financial penalties due to cell phone usage while driving. In brief, the financial cost of crashes due to distractions far outweigh the benefits of cell phone use.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use phones in capacity while operating a vehicle due to the risk towards drivers and pedestrians and enormous financial cost. While driving, drivers are exposed to many types of distraction however, distractions such as phones are in complete control of the driver.

"""Benefits of Online schools""

Students should attend online classes, for there are more benefit and opportunity for students than there are at school.

Online school include many benefits like higher chance of grade, having much more time on your schedule, and a faster way to receive credit for the class.

Online school increases student's time, so they can save more time and set up their schedule to get important things done and be able to go other places. Many students work especially in high school and college. Some students quite their job or stop going to school, for their work schedule and school schedule don't match. Also, Online schools are helpful for unemployed students, who want to volunteer or participate in sports. Instead of going to school, students are able to go on a vacation in different countries or visit their relatives in different states, by taking online classes. In conclusion, schools waste many students time and stop them from volunteering, working, and traveling by taking much of their time, for not all students have the same schedule or daily routine.

Schools can be distracting and frustrating for many students, but online classes help students have more silent and focusing environment, which helps them keep their grade up. Many fights or argument occur at school, for some students don't get along. For example, someone's conversation or actions can be distracting to others, for there are students, who truly want to learn their lesson while there are students who don't. On the other hand, some students work late at night and don't get enough sleep because they have to go to school early in the morning. Eventually, they end up receiving low grade for sleeping in the class and not being able to focus on the lesson. By taking online classes, students understand and learn the lesson better by repeating or reread the lesson online at home, where it's silent and less distracting. As a result, students receive higher grade attending online classes because students have more time to sleep, have more personal space, and it's much easier to learn online than at school.

One of the best benefits of online schools is that there are no delays, and students don't miss any lessons due to any weather condition, viruses, or sickness. Many schools cancel or delay due to heavy snow, hurricanes, or viruses. For example, schools in Generic_City are closing due to Corona virus. Besides, students, who have Corona or any other illness, don't miss any of their assignments or tests, for they can do them online while resting.

In conclusion, online schools are faster way for students to finish their class with high grade and without any missing assignment.

Some students might argue that going to school is much is easier than online schools, for you can ask your teacher questions and get personal help from them. They also might argue that you can't meet other students and discus the lesson with them attending online classes. Most of online classes contains teacher's email or there is a way to send a massage and ask questions relating to the lesson. Sometimes, there are group chats for students to attending the same online class to communicate and discus the lesson. But however, communication between students are not necessary or a way for students to learn more about the lesson. Though, being able to ask your teacher questions relating to the topic can be helpful.

Attending online class has many impact on student's time. Being able to get enough sleep and have your personal space, students can be focused, which helps them to keep their grade up and learn more about their lessons. last but not least, attending online class at anytime, students can do other things like working, going to vacation, and attending other classes or events keep them active. At last, students don't miss any assignment due to any delay or sickness. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Attention my fellow citizens, we should limit car usage  because limiting car usage will release stress, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, and stop smog.

First, we should limit car usage because driving a car can be stressful. For example say you just got finished with a hard day of work and it was not the best day, You hop in your car and when you start to drive you look ahead and see a trafic jam. After working all day, getting in a car to wait hours and hours to get home is not peaceful or fun. Another example would be when you're on the road and the people around you are not driving safely. ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happeir this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two.(In geram suburb life goes on, paragraph 3)

Not only does the usage of cars cause stress but it also causes greenhouse gas. The use of cars should be limitted because we could drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (In geram suburb life goes on, paragraph 5) Using a car to get around is nice but isint living on earth better than driving a gas powered vehicle and slowly destroying the earth? ""All of our development since World War II has been on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transport for America.(P7)

Finally, We should limit the usage of cars because if we do we can stop smog. Smog is pollution that creates clouds all around and it is discusting and horrible for the earth. 'Bejing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""(Paris bans driving due to smog, Paragraph 14) After intensifying smog, congestion was down 60 percent and thats only after 5 days thats incredible!

All in all, we should limit car usage because if we can use cars less than we do, it will ease stress, reduce greenhouse gas, and finally clean the earth. What do you say, use your car less and get some exersize? Thanks for reading my fellow citizens.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The neighboring planet to earth, known as Venus has been considered a land of danger. This however, does not stop astronaunts from searching for the unknown answers behind this magnificent planet. Venus represents itself hotter in tempature than Mercury (the closest planet), and is known not to be hospitible to any outside objects. This essay will be explaining few of the reasons why Venus is in fact an intresting discovery in the universe, and depict why it is yet so dangerous.

The first reason why Venus is a worthy pursuit towards the information it consist about, is because if NASA were able to test rocks and other materials, then it would impact the history of science. Science is an amazing attribute to society and if NASA could develop the technology to be able to enter the Venus atmostphere then all the lost questions will be answered. It is also, very similar to Earth.

If the danger of Venus could be determined to an exact pin point then we could use the results to fix and calculate other situations. Each time Earth as send a space aircraft to Venus, it had only lasted moment before it melted. If the substance could be tested then it would influence the world in a scientific way.

In conclusion, despite the critical mess of Venus, many people find it special and unique. The more scientist that get involved with making new technology to show Venus' value, can also help bring the world closer. This is true, because the more that are influenced are the more that will make a difference to society. If NASA exposes continually how similar Venus is to Earth then the way we look at things scientifically will conjure our thoughts ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Students should design these projects to let the teacher see how creative students can be. Also to show the diffrent ways students can use their mind to comlete the project in the course of the their break. In some cases students will not want to do any work over their break, but if these students can design the assignment and do what ever project they want to do they will be willing to do the work. Furthermore, students being able to design a project for the course of summer break will help students learn how to complete a task they assign themelves and will help students be able to set goals and accomplish them in the future.

This form of learning can assist students in being creative and opening up the mind to new things. Those qualitys help expand the information you know and can benefit you in the long run. These things form a intellegent mind thats why I feel its a need to try and do new things to learn. For example, there was a time when I was told by a teacher to try a new method in reading that I come up with because she said thats something to make you remember what youve just learned ,and ever since then I have always been open to new things and ideas when it comes to coming up with a new way of learning. Therefore, I always try to incourage others to do the same because its something that strenghtings you, opens the mind, and makes you a smarter individual.

Using your mind in diffrent ways stimulates students brains and Creates new pathways for information to be shared. This is a way to get a better understanding of ways you can look at certain situations as a student. For instance, you might not like the way things are going in class but if you were to sit and think of better ways to handle the problem it will show you that thinking in diffrent ways can make a problem a blessing you just have to be willing to put forth the effort. trying is better than not trying and that can make a big diffrence in your life and how you live it. It takes being diverse on how you think to become a great student.

Students creating their own project for their summer break is one of the best things you can get a student to do because they have to think and use diffrent ideas to complete a assignment that they choose. Its important to understand the importance of this because it will give them something to do to remember what they learned from school in the past year while they are on summer break, so they can't forget any information that is needed for years to come. Also will be alot easier for them to accomplish things in the future due to working in the summer nights through school and this will highly benefit the students and their future. Thats the reason I think this will be beneficial to anyone who attempts.

Another reason is that it will prepare the students for a heavy work load in years to come. For example, being in highschool and later going on to college is not just a walk in the park its hard days and long nights to accomplish something bigger. Students doing this at a young age will have them ready for the highschool and college lifestyle. Also will give them something they can never loose and thats the dicipline you get from doing obstacles like this because it keeps you from getting distracted and helps you focus harder on the project and they all starts with you aswell so its the dicipline you aquire from doing things like that.

In conclusion, students are required to design their own project they are to complete over the course of summer and create it by themselves. I agree with this because it can give the students important qualities that they only can get from doing something like a self made project and can benefit them for their future. Doing certain things in life are only to help you learn and grow and doing a project like this will help you be able to multitask and do things a different way then you see everyone else doing. Therefore students designing their own projects can help and benefit them to be a better individuals in the future.                                                                                                                                                          ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Generic_City is a vibrant city located in the western region of Uzbekistan with a long and rich history. It was founded around 2000BC by the ancient Silk Road traders, and due to its strategic location has been a major point of exchange and commerce for centuries. Throughout its long history, the city has seen the rise and fall of numerous empires, with each one leaving their mark on the town.

Today, Generic_City is an architectural gem, filled with ancient forts, mosques and palaces representing the various cultures and kingdoms which have called this city home. From its soaring domes and minarets to the vibrant floral designs adorning its walls, Generic_City’s buildings offer a time capsule into the past.

Just as diverse as the city’s architecture is its food. The city’s traditional cuisine is a unique blend of Persian, Indian and Chinese flavors, served with local spices such as cumin and coriander. From the tender plov (boiled rice with meat) to the delicate samsa (samosa-like pastry parcels), Generic_City’s food represents a rich tapestry of flavors. Visitors to Generic_City can experience a journey through time, culture and flavor.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"In many cases there is two sides to an arguement. When there is two sides to an arguement it could go either way. In this case the arguement is about the electoral college. What is the electoral college,it is the the process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the consitution as a compromise between election of president by a vote in congress and election of presidentby popular vote of qualilfied citizens.(stated in paragraph 1) I believe strongly that we should keep the electoral college, beacuse it keeps people from directly voting for a presdient,keeps everything even and mostlikely fair. Most people think that we should get rid of the electoral college,its clearly a state of opinion.

When you really sit down and think about how most people vote in the Northeast and South they are not the thoughtful voters. (said in paragraph 19 line 2 paragraph 4) Take obama for an example, he was the first black presidental canidate and most of the darker skined group of people got excited because for the first time in history a black man could be president,many blacks thought that voting for the black president would mean that they would better respersatition in office,so many blacks and some whites voted for obama to win. Not really paying much attention to what or who they were voting for. Which you could probably figure out that obama won they had the bigger vote. If we are able to keep the electoal college it would mean that wouldnt happen agian because it could go through the electorals they would choose who is best. Dont get me wrong people actually voted for obama anyways ,because of what he  stood for but most didn't.

In reality most people think that the voting is unfair, like what happened with Presidnet Kennedy. Kennedy was the stronger, better canidate to be president. I believe that the electors chose right, it may not have been who the people wanted. He was way better then Nixon could ever be. That may have made the people very mad,which led to the assination of President Kennedy. Kenndey changed the country and to this day in my mind, known as one of the best presdidents we ever had. Thanks to the electoral system we had Kennedy elected instead of Nixon,could you just imagine how the country would be today. If Kennedy didnt win,or if Nixon was president just one little thing could change everything. Everything happens for a reason and having the electoral college helps. I know that Nixon has the popular vote but kennedy needed to win for the better of our country,its my state of opinion.

Most people think that having the electoral college is bad,why? because they believe that the people should be able to vote directly. I understand how and why they believe that. When you think about votin directly it would insure the people that whoever they are voting for they would be sure to get thier votes and for sure get the president that they wished to be president. I could truley undertsand why and this would work out, but i still strongly believe that this could be the cause to many problems.

In conclusion,I beleive that we shoudl keep the electoral college becaue he keeps the people for choosing a president direlcetly. If they make a bad chose someone,who knows is the better canidate that they could over rule the peoples vote. So it would all fair in most turns and would possibably helping the country,and many people believe otherwise its truely a state of opinion. You choose who chooses the president.

"There is some consensus of when it comes to if student should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Although some people think student should not take online clasess, neverthless, there is some people who agrees with that situation in education. Because, the online clasess are time limit so they can use their time wisely in other things and student who have to face transportation problem every morning, clasess from home will make their life more easier.

To bging taking online clasess from home is much more valuable because those clasess are time limited, so that student can use their other time wisely. For example, usually online clasess have seseaons which is fixed time. One course must have to be done by that seseaon time. In that case student can plan their study in a day and do a job in their free time. In USA most of the student have to take loan to finish thier education. So doing a job while taking an online course will help a lot with those loan terms. Clearly, it is binificial to take online clasess and agree with the offer of distance learning.

Farthermore, student who do not have own transportation, online clasess are the best option for them. For instance, in USA it is a big problem for people who do not have own transportation. Most of the time its the student who suffers most. Every single morning they have to rush for public transportation to go to the campus so that they will not get late for class. Some time it effects thier attendence, depends on institute and thier professors. This proves that taking an online class solve most of those problems easily. And student will be able to focuse on study more than handeling little problems like those, which is alomost turning into a part of their daily life.

Overall, it is much more imprtent that taking a class online saves time and let student do other jobs to earn enough and a oportunity for them to be on time when there is a possiblity of being late to the class only because of transportation problem. This shows that student should attend clasess from home by way of online or vedio conferencing and accept the offer of distance learning.   ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"There are many efforts from different countries to reduce car usage.  Countries like Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States are trying to raise awareness and get people to not use their car as much.  These countries are raising awareness for example by having car-free days, banning driving for a day, turning suburbs into car-free communities, and rasing awareness about how cars affect the enviroment.  These counrties are making the efforts to reduce car usage because they know that there are great advantages if citizens limit their car usage.

In Vauban,Germany, low-car suburban life is their motto.  Car ownership is allowed , but with a price.  As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move to Vauban.  Heidrun Walter says that she is happier without a car and when she did have a car, she says she was always tense.  Vauban is an example of the efforts and new idea that Europe, United States, and elsewhere have to reduce car usuage.  Some advantages of this low-car concept is that now stores are being placed in walking distance and malls and resturants are also within walking distance and close to each other.

Because of air pollution and smog due to cars, Paris had to start banning people from driving certain days.  If you  were caught driving when you weren't suppose to, a fine was inforced.  Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters.  Diesel fuel was the blame of the smog because France perfers diesel over gas.  Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France according to Reuters.  Paris has more smog than most European capitals.  This is really hurting the enviroment.  While Paris was banning cars, congestion was down 60 percent.  Besides car congestion being down 60 percent, other advatages to this car banning was that non-hybrid car companies lost revenue while hybrid and plug in cars were not.  This shows how people are aware of the pollution of cars.  Also, because of the reduced driving, the smog in Paris was cleared enough to stop banning certain vehicles from driving.

A big event in Bogota, Colombia is their car-free day.  Only buses and taxis were permitted.  Violators of the car-free day faced a fine.  The turnout was large even though there was rain.  ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"", said the Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus.  Citizens of Colombia were happy participating in the car-free day.

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode his bike.  Municipal authorities from all over the world came to see this event. The city's mayor also says that the day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid- 1990's.  The advantage of the car-free day has made parks and sports centers more popular to go to and other advatages is that the old sidewalks are being replaced with new paved ones.  The traffic has also reduced.

In the United States, President Obama goals are to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions.  The Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities.  The efforts to reduce driving is paying off.  A study found that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.  Mr. Sivak's research shows a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39 year olds getting a liscense.  In New York, there is a new bike sharing program and that can help people to choose to take bike instead of riding in a car.

All these efforts are helping people make the decision to limit their car usage and based on the facts, there are alot of advantages if you limit car usage.  This is only a start to raise efforts to reduce car usage, but I feel in the future we will be seeing a lot more people walking and biking than riding their car.             ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. They belive that they have a better chance at making the right choice. There are many reasons why people seek multiple opinions, one might be trustworthiness , another would be the more wiser person, and the last reason is that people might get you out of trouble.

One reason why people might ask for multiple opinions is trustworthiness. What I mean by that is a person might trust one person more than he trusts the other. One person might be closer to you than the other. The one closer to you might know more about you and knows how you feel. If you ask someone you dont really talk to then maybe they try to be funny and make you look stupid. If it was a friend then it would be different because they don't want to see you fail or they won't betray you. Also if you ask one person and they betray you and make you look stupid then you will learn your lesson to not ask them for help ever again.

Another reason to ask multiple people is to ask the more wiser person . What I mean by that is one person might be more wiser and knowledgabe than the other. If you ask a person that has been in that type of situation then they might know what to do and how to handle it. It's either they made the wrong decision and knows how to fix it. Or he made the right decision and knows what to do. Either way it is better to ask some one who has been in that problem before and got out of it safetly than asking someone who has never been in the type of problem and does'nt have any advice.

The last reason is that maybe someone can get you out of trouble. What I mean is that if you are planning up something to do that is not very good, someone might stop you and tell you that it is not a very good choice to make.

It could also refer back to people being in the same situation you are. The person that has been in your shoes one time might have been planning up to do the same but they got in big trouble and regreted it. So they would warn you and tell you the punnishment and it might change your mind. Seeking multiple opinions would tell you how to handle the problem or even stop it if your not even a victom.

Seeking multiple opinions is'nt bad after all. You can learn how to fix a probblem or even stop one. You can learn who to trust and who not to trust. Those are all ways seeking multiple opinions can help you in a problem.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal,

Community service is a very helpful thing towards the community, if its cleaning up after a high school game or planting a tree it will all have a positive outcome. I think it would be a good idea to have us do community service because there are a lot of things that need help being done and there are so many kids at school. If they all work together they could easily clean up a school step by step. Some children fail to see the opportunity that you are faced with and do not recognize that they could take ten minutes from their day for a good cause. I see why you are struggling with this decision, some kids might act up and also write letters to you about why we should not have to do anything. Others want to help the town, and show that they care. I personally would love to help you out.

I do not do community service a lot and only have once during school one year, but I understand that some things need done from time to time. During school my teacher had us go out to the high school football stadium and clean up after the past nights game. We went through the stands and picked everything up and placed it in plastic bags to dispose of. The trash was everywhere and it seems it was going to take years. Then after that we picked litter up near the school and in brush. I found it amazing how fast we finished the huge task because of the amount of people participating. I believe that if everyone from the school helped, they would finish rather quickly.

"Dear principal,

I believe that policy 2 works better because students will not be so tempted to text during class and disrupt others while they are working. And so that while testing days they wont be able to cheat off of each other. Also, kids won't follow the rule turn off there cell phones during class. And if they need to call someone they could use the school phone. So there isn't a real reason why cell phones should be at school. Cell phones are just a distraction during the day. Think if you were taking a test and all you could hear was the kid next to you texting for the answers. What do you think?

Isn't it a distraction to you and everyone around the kid? Well in my opinion that is just annoying. And think about when they are walking down the hall. They are texting and looking at there phone then they run into someone or they could trip and injure themselves and others. And if they and using there phone down the stairs they would trip and injure everyone on the way down. And that's why you should pick policy 2.

"Using this technology is valuable to read peoples emotions. The doctors and prof. say that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the face;all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit. Also Dr. huang observes that artists such as da vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

Dr. Huang also stated that most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication. Dr. Huang also gave some examples of what movments to do in front of a mirror. For example raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. second squint your eyes slightly,to produce wrinkling (""crow's-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up,toward your eyes.

They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the Zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile,muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. So based on what i put down on this final draft my claim is that this kind of technology is valuable.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Although going to school with peers and learning face to face with an instructor is considered effective and traditional, it is not always a viable option. Students may not be able to go to attend classes for various reasons, and distance learning by the way of online and video conferencing may be the only option. Distance learning by online and video conferencing can benefit the students by allowing them to access the educational content anywhere at many times throughout the day, It allows them to learn even if the students are unable to attend school, and more courses can be taught online.

The backbone of modern day society largely consists of what we all keep in our pocket, our phone. This device can connect to the world wide web at any time and retrieve information from almost anywhere. Teachers have become aware of this, and have started to assign online assignments more consistently. In the case that a student cannot attend school, they can still learn this way, whether they are across the globe or right at home. If a student needs to speak to a teacher, they can choose a time at any point throughout the day to conference, rather than just having one class to speak to the teacher and then holding on to questions until the next class.

There are many reasons why a student may not be able to attend school; they may be sick, traveling, or the school may simply be closed. This can cause many students to fall behind their peers if they do not receive the help they require. Teaching a student via online conferencing can be an effective way to counteract these problems. Teaching them online will allow students to learn without the having to leave their home.

At most schools, students are limited to the courses that teachers are trained and willing to teach. This may differ from the course the student wishes to learn. But because data can be sent and received from any point online, students are not restricted to only learning what the teachers at their local school are able to teach. A much wider variety of courses can be offered online as students could choose courses from teachers all over the county. Say a student wanted to learn how to code but there is no computer science teacher at their school. The student could conduct an online conference with computer science teachers from other schools regularly to learn the topic. If a student were to travel to another school just to take a class, it would not be nearly as time and cost efficient as learning via video or online conferencing.

As Northern Virginia prepares for a possible Coronavirus epidemic which could potentially close down schools across the county or even the state, and Generic_City has scheduled a day for teachers to solely learn the basics of online training, it has never been a more important time to discuss whether of not students would benefit from attending classes home by way of online or video conferencing. Some argue that learning online is not as effective as learning in class, but the benefits of online learning far outweigh the problems caused. Distance learning for students can benefit them by allowing them to access content anywhere at nearly any time throughout the day, It allows them to learn even if they are unable to attend school, and more courses can be taught online.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"First, Face is just a natural landform because even if it was created by alians there should be some type of building or something some where a round the Face like a building. Think about it. Do you really think that some alian is going to build something like that and leave it there? There is so much things we don't know about Mars, but aliens are not real. According to the text,""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

Second, when we took a picture of the Face in 1976. It was because of the weather that it looked like a face. Another reason is because of the angle that we took a picture in. It might also have been the camera. Because of the angle that in took the picture in, the shadow of the mountains made it look like a face. According to the text,""The caotion noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth.""

Next, in 1998, we decided to take another picture of the Face. The tecnology became better and so we got a better view of the Face. It does't look as much like the face we took a picture of in 1976. This time it looked more like a crater. It wasn't a face after all.

Then, in 2001, we took another picture because it was so popular. According to the author,""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" You might think that aliens are real. According to the text,""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" We have been searching Mars for a while now and if there was any life form on Mars we would have found it already.

Finally, Face is just another natural land form. According to the author,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Hello I am a student at SCHOOL_NAME the school that you are the principle of. I would like to persuade you to not allow phones at school for three reasons. One they will distract students and they will not be able to do the work that is given to them. Second they will use there phones at school to call there parents to get them because they do not want to be at school. Last, teacher will find that students are no longer paying attention to them and pull out there own cell phone and use it to call friends and family. So those are the reasons that I think that students should not be aloud to bring their phones to school.

First the students will like this new policy that allows cell phones at school and I think that this is a bad idea. the students will be in class and texting other student in different classes or even in the same class. They will not be able to concentrate on what they are doing if they are texting there friends.

Second they will try to call their parents to come and pick them up. kids do not want to be at school so there is no way that people will not try to get their parents to get them. Students do not want to be studying the Greeks they rather be playing video games and do other thing at home.

Third teacher will want to pull their phone out and text and call friends and family. Then no one is being taught any thing and no one will learn. people will not care about school any more and just stay home.

So if there is any choices that you would take I would advise this one. this is the best choice because students will be distracted, they will call their parents to come and get them, and lastly teachers will start texting in class.

"Based on ideas and information in the article about advantages of limiting car usage, people are giving up their cars because of reasons such as, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in places where their reason for it is so they can experiment the outcome of it for a more secure data. Even though in the article it says that car ownership is allowed but, at the same time the amount of money for a parking place, $40,000, is way too much for people to afford. People also choose to live without an automobile because of how much it saves them in greenhouse gas, and other expensive things that car usage takes up. Experts and other people think that limiting the use of car transportation will make cities more denser, and will make it easier for everyone to get around without having issues. In some places, there are people who rather take a car wherever they go for better advantage, but in other places like in the United States, they are promoting ""car reduced"" communities, or for another example, in Paris, officials have ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". Studies shows that in the U.S, Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and people are starting to not get their licenses as each year goes by. The populaton growth of the number of miles that people have driven in the U.S, the number has peaked in 2005, but then steadily dropped shortly after. Therefor, people are starting to take advantages of just walking or finding their own ride places to save them money. If you lived in Paris and got fined $31 for having an even numbered license plate, or on the other day got fined for an odd numbered license plate, walking or taking a different kind of transportation would probably be a good decision for you. In the outcome of that, the article states that almost 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to their fine. France has a policy that rates diesel fuel higher than gasoline and the results of that 67 percent of diesel vehicles were compared to 53.3 percent of diesel vehicles in all of Western Europe, this is all because of the ""Smog"". A thing called ""car-free day"" takes place in Bogota, Colombia, and in this situation, according to the article, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated and even took buses to all the places they had to be, which in return of that, the streets were left eerily devoided of all possible traffic jams. On this ""car-free"" day, car use is banned for the whole day leaving people with only having the choice of taxis and buses to take them to work, or anywhere else they had to be. Not to mention there are 7 million people who live in the certian place, so this makes this event more difficult for most people. One of the reasons for ""car-free"" day is to take away stress, and lower air pollution throughout all of Bogota, Colombia. Limiting car usage seems to be a good resourse, there could be some bad pieces to it but, in most cases i like the idea of saving money.     ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay! 😃 I know, I know, it's not exactly the most exciting topic, but I promise I'll do my bestest to make it interesting. 😅

So, let's talk about how problems can actually be a chance for someone to do their best. Like, think about it. When things get tough, we're forced to dig deep and find a way to overcome them. It's like, when you're running a marathon and you hit that wall, but you know you can't give up or you'll never finish. You push through the pain and keep going, and it's like, boom! You crush that wall and feel so good about yourself! 💪

And it's not just about running marathons, dude. It's about life in general. When we face problems, we have two choices: we can either let them get us down and give up, or we can use them as an opportunity to show what we're made of. Like, when I had to move to a new school last year, I was totally nervous and didn't know anyone. But instead of feeling sorry for myself, I decided to make the most of it. I joined clubs and made new friends, and before I knew it, I was having the time of my life! 🎉

Another thing I want to talk about is how hard times can build up strength. Like, think about it. When we're going through tough times, it's like our bodies are in the gym, getting pumped up and stronger. And when we come out the other side, we're like, ""Woah, I can lift a car now! 😱"" Okay, maybe not that extreme, but you get what I'm saying. When we face challenges, we learn to be more resilient and determined, and that's something that will stay with us for the rest of our lives.

And finally, I want to talk about how hard issues can help us not repeat the past and do better. Like, think about it. When we make mistakes, it's like we're given a chance to fix them and",1,llama2_chat,4
"When you look at these pictures what do you see? It may be a face to some people and to others it might be just a natural landform. We'll never really know the truth unless somebody goes there or since its been a while it may not even be there anymore. If you went there would you come back with false or true evidnece to help support what you think it is.

On May 24,2001 the text say, ""Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be starring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia."" This shows that if this two mile long ""human face"" was real this must of had to of been a giant living on Mars. The text also says ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" This shows that this helps us know that it could of just of been a Martian mesa since its common around Cydonia.

In the image of 1998 I can see where they see the face, but then look at the picture from 2001 it just looks like a large landform. Yes it could of decayed but then by the time 1998 come it should have already been decayed and you would of thought that from image from 1976. If the mesa was a human face then it wouldn't really have all those cracks like the image from 2001 has. The text says "" A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see."" What kind of rucous do you think this would of caused?

The authors who wrote the story about the resembles a human head thought it would be a good way to have the public engage in attention toward Mars. It did! the text says ""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows.""

"The summer projects should be student designed because student designs are more creative and have more thought to it and it is simple. Teachers make the work to complicated and it is hard to do without a teachers help. Students can make it easy for themselves because they can make or find ways to make it simple and easy. Students can go on websites to gather information or have a sister or brother help maybe parents. For me a student i think it easier to have my own design because the teachers stretch the assignments they make u add supporting detail or show your work or all that extra information that we dont need.

Honestly i really dont think we should have summer assignments because whats the point in having summer break if we are assigned school work. If i want a job how am i supposed to complete these projects another reason why i think it should be student designed because if i am working all day then i can base my project on that where as a teacher would base the projects on stuuf that i wouldnt be able to have time to write about or create or grab information. I feel that if we are going to have to do work in the summer then we should be able to create our own projects not assigned teacher projects. The Teacher designs should only be for the people who need it, the students deisgns should be for the ones who dont need it because they dont need it. The teachers designs should consist of work that will help the ones who need it and the student designs are should be what they have learned through the school year.

In conclusion teacher and students designs should be based off the kids grades and efforts in schoool. Teachers shouldnt give hard and unessecery work if not needed and students should be able to create their own designs.

"Dear state senator,

I believe that the Electoral College is quite sneaky. Some people have no idea that it even exists, let alone what it is, so why have it in the first place? People vote on the president because they like what they say that they are going to do for our country. For example (in line ten, the author says), under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Basically, the people are not voting for the person they want, but for others to make the decison on who they think would be the better president .

Sometimes the candidate for president is a favorited in the north, south, south west and so on, so that gives the candidate no incentive to campaign there. If there was not an Electoral College, then the candidate would have more of a chance to actually win people over instead of taking advantage of what reigon that they come from. For example, some people think that some candidates are anachronisms because their ideas are very outdated. With the Electoral College gone, the people who are ""zoned,"" for lack of a better term, for that specific candidate, can freely choose who they think would be a better choice for president.

So, basically, I believe that the Electoral College is a terrible system because people do not even know what it is or that it exists and that favortism plays an emense part in a system that is ""ruled by the people"".

"FACS, or facial action coding system, is the use of computers to recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel. The use of this technology would be very helpful in classrooms to read students' emotional expressions.

This technology would be extremly effective in classrooms.

Dr. Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a studenrts is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor"".

If a classroom computer was put in every class, it would make learning more fun.

Not only would it make classes more fun, but it would also be a more effective way of teaching.

If you start to doze off in class the computer would change the lesson to keep you interested.

The computer would keep students attention due to their facial expression like it is forcing you to learn by keeping your eyes glued to the screen.

This kind of technology will grow a brighter generation.

The use of FACS would be very helpful in all classes.

It would make a teachers job easier for them and more helpful for the students to learn.

The value of using of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions would be highly appretiated.           ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The use of technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts."" This is important because some students wont ask for help when they are confused or troubled. Secondly, more than often when a student is bored they will fall asleep causing them to miss important information. ""By weighing the different units, the software can even recognize mixed emotions.""So if a student is a little cofused the software wont make it ""just so easy"" but it'll reduce the challenge.

If uniterested in the subject at hand or with the class as a whole they will become unattached an fail the class potentially causing them not to graduate. ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" By modifying the subject or lesson it could make it easier or make it harder for a student in class. If a person seems to be frowning the software could ease up. Also if the student is having a good time with the software it's a possability that it could make it a little harder.

Even people that dont use much emotion in their face the software will still be able to calculate their emotions. ""The facial expressions for each emotions are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" So if a student isn't very exspressive this software will still be able to calculate their emotions with the slightest movement of their facial structor. ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face."" So even the slightest change is detected. When detected the software will switch the level of challenge.

In closing this software is a very important improvement to schools everywhere. The software will help you stay interested and connected with the lesson.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Students would really benefit from being able to attend classes from home. One of the reasons that they would benefit is that if they are sick and cannot make it to school, they can still get notes and talk and learn from home, they still have that option when they cant attend school. Another reason is that if they are far from the school district and can't make it to the school they have online school, there they can still learn and participate. Last reason is that they have a better learning experience from themselves and having a one on one conference call so they can ask as many questions as they can because some people learn better like that. All these reasons support me on why schools should offer distance learning and how it would actually benefit students on learning and different situations.

My first reason on why school's should have distance learning is if they cannot attend school for sickness or any medical reason and just cannot be there. Many students get sick and are unable to come to school, but with distance learning, I think that students would be able to get what they missed and still learn from they days they have not been at school. Sometimes students get into injuries because of sports or just need a mental break from school and stay at home. Some students would feel safer and better at home, and it would be really beneficial for them to have that option of distance learning from home.

Another reason is that if the students live far from a school district and can't make it because of transportation. Some students live out in urban areas and there are no close schools to them and they should have an option to have distance learning. Other students don't have the transportation to get to school. While other students need to stay home for whatever reason and just can't make it to school. This would really help students in rural or urban areas or students that don't have a school close to them.

Last reason is for students that have a better learning experience from a one on one conference call or just like learning by themselves. All students have many different learning styles and one of them would be self learning through watching videos. Other students would have better help not being in a classroom and just having a one on one conference call with a teacher and they can get the most help they can get than being in school. It all depends on the students learning styles but students with these would probably be very beneficial to them.

In conclusion, all these reasons show how and why distance learning can be very beneficial to students. Students that are unable to attend school for being sick can still learn from home. Other students that dont live near school or are near a school district can still ""attend"" school and learn. Many students have different learning styles and self learning students and having one on one calls with teachers would really help them instead of them being in class or school. I think distance learning is a great option for students for these reasons and school should have them as an option for students to choose.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"This technology, Facial Action Coding System, reads the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because its creative, it tells you the percentage of their emotion, it can tell you how other people feel, and its fun to play with.

First reason, its valuable because it shows creativity. You can use it while making a game. For those people who like to make animation movies, you can use it to change the character's face. This can make the audience understand the character's expression by seeing them happy, angry and etc. The students can use this for those who like to make video games or make animation movies in the future.

Second reason, the Facial Action Coding System tells you the percentage of their emotion. You can see it by scanning their face and you'll be able to see the percentage of their emotion. You'll see their mix emotions like excited, upset, content and etc. This can be a fun thing to do with the students. They can go around and see their friend's emotions and see how they feel.

Third reason, is when you know your friend is not fine but they said that they are, you can check by using the technology, Facial Action Coding System, to see their actual emotions. You can see how your friend truly feels. This technology is absolutely amazing because how it can change your expression. The students would probably think that this technology is truly valuable.

Last reason, is it's fun to play with. Nowadays, there are apps that can change your emotion. Students can use this and have fun with it. Also the technology, Facial Action Coding System, is much better than the app. It actually show you the percentage on how that person feels.

This is how the technology, Facial Action Coding System, is valuable to use at students in a classroom.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear state senator,

Many people do not think that the Electoral College is not fair, or exact. In fact, people wanted to boycott it in 2000. I suggest that we change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. It is fair to the candidates and to the people of our country, and we should be able to choose our president, not the electors. Also, if we keep the Electoral College, voting will be unfair and it only makes people want to stop voting. I will explain to you the details of these reasons why we should change it in the rest of my letter.

To begin with, we should change to popular voting because it is fair to everyone. The people want a fair election. Presidents can be chosen wisely by the people, and candidates will be chosen fairly. People want a safe election, so that they can feel safe and protected with the president that we all chose together. It is only unfair to not let us have the advantage of expressing our own opinions. That is a reason why we should change the Electoral College to election by popular voting for the president .

The second reason why we should change to popular voting is because we, as in the people of the United States, should have the advantage of voting for our own president, not the electors. The people know what they want and need to vote for the candidate based on their own opinions. Electors have different opinions, which is not fair at all since we are not really voting. They are only changing our votes and not agreeing with the votes of the people. That is the second reason why the government should change the Electoral College to election by popular voting for the president.

A disadvantage of keeping the Electoral College is that it is unfair and it makes less people want to vote for a president. In 2012, only half of the whole United States voted for a president. They did not think voting was really necessary anymore, since we are not really voting. It also makes the people feel worthless since their votes do not really count anymore. We basically do not have a say in our own country, and that is not fair to us or the government. That is why keeping the Electoral College is a bad idea, and we should change it.

This is why you should reconsider changing to popular vote, for the good of our country. It is honestly a much better process for our country , the citizens, and especially for the candidates that want to make a great difference in the place we live in. Popular voting is fair to candidates and people, we should choose our president, not electors, and the Electoral College is unfair and makes less people want to vote. Thank you for reading and listening to my letter. Have a great day.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Do you ever wonder how many soomething is or how much something weights? In this essay the author compares more than one thing to one another.

The author supports the idea of ""The Challenging of Exploring Venus"" by comparing ""Earth as Venus twin and that it is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closet in distance too"" which means that Earth is the closet planet to Venus than any other planet in the world. Another way the author supports his text is by saying that ""Earth,Venus,and Mars,our other planety neighbor,orbit the sun at different speeds"" what that means is that all those other planets are the ones neighboring to it and that they have many different speeds and are many different sizes throughout the whole planet while it orbits. The third way the author supports his information in the text is by how he compares all the other planets to one another not just one planet to the next. Last supporting text the author supports in this is that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" what the author is trying to say is that one big thickness of the atmosphere is almost basically covered 97 percent with a carbon dioxide blanket. In conclusion the author compares all these planets to one another.

In the second paragrah the author loves to use many different techniques to describe the story to people who are reading it. Another thing the author does in the story is tell how much Earth,Venus,Mars weigh throughout the whole story. Another way the author supports his evidence in the story is by telling us were they are located at.

In conclusion,the author supports his text very well by comparing the other planets to each other not just to one another. Also the author likes to use numbers to show how much of the percent got covered or how many times something happened during the times throughout the whole thing something got done in or covered.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Nowaday, the world of technology is really big all around the world. People start to use technology for everything in their daily life. From their house, their school or work. Phone, laptop, computer, cars, etc. Each day a lot of inventors work hard to produce their invention to make the world better. Recently, iphone company just release a new iphone called iphone X that you can unlock the phone without using your finger, you can just look at the camera and the phone will recognize your face and open it for you. That is a really popular invention that everyone excited to buy and love to use. People create many new technology for it to communicate with humans like iphone X as an example. Thomas Huang professor of University of Illinois collaboration with Nicu Sebe professor of University of Amsterdam created a software called :""Facial Action Coding System."" The software were created because Dr. Huang said that he want to develop better ways for huamsn and computers to communicate. The software can recognize humans emotions. Either, you happy, sad, fear or surprise, the computer just look at you and tell what is your feeling right the way. Because Dr. Huang is a professor at University of Illinois, beside the software he just look like every professior that have to go to class and teach. As many people know, not every time you attend the class you understand what the teacher teach you. Sometime you get bored, sometime you get confused or tired. But all of that emotions you are the only one that know about it. With that in mind, Dr. Huang wanted to bring the software to his class so he will know his lesson is actually go through students mind or not. He will know the time to change the topic to make student more productive, more happy and enjoy in his lesson. Not just only him, every teacher in the world need this sofware, everyone want their students to happy to learn. More happy you are, more focus you are in the class. The Facial Action Coding System is a valuable software for school that help teacher recognize students feeling and that can make the class better.

Here is how it works. According to the article ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles"" This show that, we can believe in the result of the software after its read the emotions. Because the computer created a model of the face, with all muscles that humans has. When you move your face the 3-D model of the face will form exactly the same as your face to help the software recognize what is that emotion. One of psychologist and creator of FACS that work with Dr. Huang is Dr. Paul Eckman has classified there are six basic emotions :""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" That is what emtions of a regular humans looks like. Either you happy because you got good grades, or anger because someone ate you ice cream that you save for a long time. They bring every emotions of humans in real life in the software to help help it easily recognize humans face. One of the example from the article is when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you are surprised, or your orbicularis oris (around your moth) tightens your lips to show anger. The computer is really smart, just look to your face and form the 3-D it can easily show how mad you are, how sad you are. Even from the painting Mona Lisa of Leonardo da Vinci, the computer show she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fear ful and 2 percent angry. You can see how smart it is. If you mad and angry or surprise at the same time, the computer will still know and point of the percent of each emotions. When you make a fake smile, the software still recognize it. According to the article ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" You cannot lie to them, they already know exactly how you give them fake or real smile. Go back with Dr. Huang classroom. Why is FACS is a valuable software for study at school? Because when you are tired, bored or mad about something you cannot focus on the lesson or what the teacher or proffessor teach you. From that the computer will recognize your emotions and tell the teacher your feeling. Teacher cannot make you forget about your problems but they will create or find another way to make the class seem more fun or do more activities instead of just standing and read ore teach boring stuff that you don't care about. That's help you feel more comfortable, in that way when you feel happy and relax you can focus on your work more. All of the stuff that you learn will easily come to your brain and you will remember it.

The FACS is a great software for school. It can help teacher/professor a lots in their way of teaching students and from that students will focus more on the teaching time. Not just classroom, this could help many people around the world with whatever they do. Because sometime, humans being never tell anyone about their feeling, they just sad and angry but noone now about it. Using computer to communicate with them is a great ideas. Like an example in the article, when it recognize your emotions and know that you sad, it will find an ad or something funny that can make you laugh right the way. Since many people around the world using technology all the time, people should create more things that could help technology communicate with humans. Because it could help the world more modernized, help the people without family or friends feel better when they communicate with technology. Growth more technology will make the world better.

"Some students don't shre there emotions because something bad or wrong happened in there life they don't want to talk about. Why bring it out of them with technology?

In paragragh 7 it gives intrusctions on what to do when looking in the mirror. Then goes on to talk about how those intrusctions show a happy face and what those muscle actions show if a person shows a genuine smile or a foced smile. If a person was told to follow those instructions wouldn't that be considered a forced smile. What if a student has a bad day during school and in a lab they have to follow these instuctions in a mirror that would be a foced smile. I think that we should not deal with others emotions or try to figure them out because it there life and if they want to let there emtions out they can. Im not trying to say that you should keep your emotions inside and struggle with them. Im saying that a person shouldn't be watched all the time and studied to find there emotions. In paragraph 6 it talks about in an example if you smile or forwn in a Web ad when it appears on your screen a similar follows or changes. Most poeple hate ads poping up on there screen so why make more pop up according to your emotions. A person with an ad popping up made be fine the frist time, but when it happens over and over again the person may get upset or angry because the ads ar changing his/her emotions.

Emotions should be left alone or delt with at the right time, not monitored all the time. I think this technology is an invastion of privacy in a way. People should live there life how they want to live it and if they want there emotions being monitored they can, but if not they have the right to refuse. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"One of the greatest benefits of schools controlling student involvement in extracurricular activities is that it allows for a balanced approach to education and career decisions. By managing the types and number of extracurricular activities students are involved in, schools can ensure students receive all the necessary information to decide on an optimal course for their future. For example, rather than having students commit to a single activity or hobby, a carefully managed balance of multiple extracurricular activities helps students explore all potential interests, make informed decisions, and find the perfect match to their academic career path. This in turn increases their chances of success and significantly improves their overall student experience.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Have you ever done a summer assignment? Would you rather have it done your way or the teachers way? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because the project will be more focused on what will be learned in class, the project will be more structured to what they're looking for, and the project will be useful to the student.

However, some people may argue that if the project is student-designed, then the student would be more engaged. For example, in ninth grade, the English department demanded an essay written during the summer. When the teacher started collecting papers, I was one of two students who turned in a paper. Almost all the students didn't do the summer assignment. So if the summer assignments were student-designed, then more students could perhaps be more involved. Nevertheless, there are other viewpoints to consider.

To begin with, the project will be more focused on what will be learned in class. For example, in seventh grade, my English teacher required that you write a paper about what you did during the summer. I didn't know what kind of writing she was expecting, but with this essay she was able to tell what we needed to work on. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers will focus on what most students need to learn. This is only one reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed.

In addition, the project will be more structured to what they're looking for. For instance, just like on the writing SOL, there are directions; they are looking for something specific. They are looking for a thesis, transition words, and more to see what you've learned. When you include all those elements that the grader is looking for, you will pass. Summer projects should be teacher designed because you can do all the things that they expect out of the project and you will get a good grade. There are more reasons as to why a summer project should be teacher-designed.

Finally, the project will be useful to the student. Consider as an example, I read about ""the curve of forgetting."" In short, over time, you forget things at an exponentially increasing rate if you don't review the materials you learned one day. The purpose of summer projects are to make sure students keep learning over their long break, so that they don't experience this ""curve"" as much and keep it almost as fresh as when they did learn it on the first day. The project will be useful to the student because they will use this learning in the classroom when they return to school. The claims and evidence stated above all lead to the same conclusion.

In conclusion, teacher-designed summer projects are better than student-designed summer projects because it's more tailored to the class, it's better for the grader and the student, and the information learned will be used in the class and future classes in the same subject. For summer projects to be teacher-designed matters because we need useful learning. I want you to think about if there was a time when you had to do a summer assignment where it was up to you to decide everything. How did it go?",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The Electoral Collge is a process where electors vote for President and Vice President, and count the number of electoral votes by Congress. Many people are debating whether or not keep the Electoral College or change it to a election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Although the Electoral College has been taking place for many years now, it can be a disaster factor. I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished and changed to a election by popular vote for the president of the United States because it will make the election fair, the chance of there being a tie is much less, and it will be rather rational as oposed to the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is not fair and it is irrational. Voters don't vote directly to the president they want. According to Source 1: ""What is the Electoral College?"" voters actually voting for their candidate's electors. Majority of the states have a ""winner- take- all"" system in which electors are awarded to the winning candidate. Voters don't get to chose who exactly they want, it's based upon which elector they chose that really determines who will win the presidential election. The voters can't always control what the elector they chose does with what thy're decision was on who they wanted to win the election, and they just as well get confused and sometimes possibly make the wrong choice. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is fair for anyone who votes. There is less chance of getting confused and less chance of picking the wrong elector. Even though others may argue that each party selects trusted electors to vote for the patry's nominees, it's still not fair to those who get confused and end up picking the wrong elector which leads to wrong vote towards the presidential election.

The chances of it turning out to be a tie aren't low. Accoring to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral Colleg: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", a tie has happened before. States have sent two states of electors to Congress. Although it happened long ago, it doesn't mean that it won't occur anytime again. Abolishing the Electoral College can give a less chance for that to occur. Since staes have the ""winner- take- all"" system, the candidates don't even spend time or focus on the states that thye know they have no chance in winning in. According to source 2, there were seventeen states who didn't even get to see the election at all, and some votes didn't even get to see the ad of the campaign.

The presidential election will become rational to many people. There may be cons to abolishing the Electoral College but there are more pros to it rather than cons. It would make the presidential election fair and easier for the voters voting for the candidates. People may argue that it's best to keep the Electoral College because some states may not have enough people voting for the candidates so it wouldn't be possible to directly vote for the president of the United States but there are more states who do have the chance to chose and make a direct decision rather than picking an elector who may or may not go agaisnt the party that had picked them and then they can end up chosing who they, the electors want instead of what the voter really wanted and intended. Many people may be able to agree that it is best to abolish the Electoral College instead of keeping it. The electors are picked mostly based upon the state.

Abolishing the Electoral College is the fair, rational, and beneficial thing to do. Keeping the Electoral College won't benefit the presidential election in any way possible. It's better to keep the election fair than otherwise. Voters should be able to know exaclty who they're picking without any confusion or without accidently picking the wrong person. People shouldn't need to be confused about who they're picking and they shouldn't have to posibly worry at the fact that the elector they voted for might defy the will of the voters and they would pick who they, the voters feel like picking rather than picking who the voters vote was actually intended for in the first place. There are risks to basically putting the voters vote in someone elses hands and the voters vote can easily be changed by one of the electors that the party had picked because they trusted that person. If the presidential election was about who you can pick directly, then it would be much easier and the voters will know that the presidential election was fair and nothing was done to change who they voted for in the beginning.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The author supports this idea that studying venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers because venus is the second planet from our sun. While venus is simple to see from the distant away but still safe . Earth, Venus, and mars are the planetary neighbor, that will go aroud the other planets. Venus is very close to the sun . Venus is just like a evening star that they call it in different places.

Each previous mission was unmanned, and for more than a few hours. They always tried to watch venus the planet to see if there was anything new or they need to know something about it . Venus is kinda hot just like the sun becuase they are both close together. Even the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. The conditions can get far more extreme then humans which can get very bad.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. Venus will be able to allow scienctists to see more thing and allow them to float above the fray. Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only provide a little amount of stuff that will go on. Venus is can be very dangous because it is so hot and u will not be able to vist it because it is so hot u will die from it . The sun and venus are the hottest out there .

The comparison system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat , and other forces. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size . Occasionally the closest in distance too . Numerous factors contributw to venus's repuatation as a challenging planet for humans to study , desprite its proximity to us .

Venus has a lot to get things from just like if you look up venus you probably can get alot from it .

"Distance learning, or the utilization of technology-based tools as an alternative to traditional in-person instruction, has become an increasingly popular option in the educational context. Distance learning has the potential to provide students with increased flexibility and autonomy over their learning, such as the ability to work at their own pace or attend to other commitments while still accessing course material. In addition, distance learning makes courses offered by different institutions available to anyone with access to the internet, opening up more learning possibilities.

At the same time, distance learning can be detrimental to some students. Certain students, such as those who do not have consistent access to the internet or reliable technology, may face difficulty in completing their course material in a timely and efficient manner. Furthermore, direct instructions and guidance from teachers can be severely limited in a distance learning environment, which can be problematic for those who require more support in their learning.

Overall, the pros and cons of distance learning must be weighed carefully depending on each individual student's learning requirements and situation. Distance learning can be an effective and beneficial form of learning in some contexts, but it can also be limiting and counterproductive in others.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Cell phones have become invaluable tools, especially for students. While cell phones offer many advantages, there are some potential drawbacks to using them in the classroom for educational purposes.

On the positive side, cell phones can be used to help students keep up with course work and class notes. Not only do they provide a convenient way to take notes, but they can also be used to access educational websites, virtual classrooms, and online videos and articles. Additionally, cell phones can be used for communication purposes, such as group collaboration on group projects or critical discussions of course material.

Despite the potential advantages, there are also some potential drawbacks to using cell phones in the classroom. For instance, students may be distracted by their phones, leading to a decrease in information retention and overall learning. Additionally, if cell phones aren’t used correctly, it could potentially lead to decreased grades. Proper responding to emails and texting in the classroom must be monitored to ensure cell phone use will be productive and not a distraction.

Overall, the use of cell phones in the classroom should not be discouraged, but instead should be used with caution and structure. When used correctly, cell phones offer an effective tool for students to access course information and engage in meaningful discussions. However, it is important to be mindful of how cell phone use can negatively affect student grades if not used properly.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Have you ever travled to another planet? If not here are some points and tips on ""The challenge of exploring Venus."" First the planet Venus is much earth-like. It can cover large lands with oceans. Venus can support various forms of life such as moutains,craters,valleys etc... Still to this day Venus still has earth like features.

Next, NASA has come up with some helpful things to help people traveling up to Venus. NASA's possible soultion for the condtions is to try and make it to where they can allow scientists to float above the surface. They say that the solar power would be plentiful and would not exceed earth levels. NASA is also doing stuff with the machines like innovations that allows people to know the knowledge of Venus.

Then, The sudies for Venus are pretty neat. The text states that,""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the cahos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Scientist also say that they think the modern computres are powerful and quick to use for studies like this. It can be resistant to the heat etc.

Finally, Despite the chanlleges and dangers they are all striving to meet the challenge. It has a lot of value to them. They want this research and all to go good because of the human curiosity.

"Sure, here's my essay:

Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. This statement by Waldo Emerson is so true, and I totally agree with it. I mean, think about it, if you always stick to what you're good at and never challenge yourself, you'll never reach your full potential.

For example, let's say you're really good at math. You get A's on all your tests and you're the president of the math club. But, you never try to do any other subjects or activities that are challenging. You'll never become a better writer, artist, or even a better mathematician. You'll just be stuck in this one area, never growing or learning new things.

Another reason why Emerson's statement is true is because when you push yourself to do something beyond what you've mastered, you develop new skills and abilities. Like, if you start playing a new sport, you might not be good at it at first, but if you keep practicing, you'll get better and better. You might even discover a new talent or passion that you never knew you had!

Also, trying new things helps you develop a growth mindset. A growth mindset is when you believe that you can always learn and grow, no matter what. When you challenge yourself, you're more likely to have a growth mindset, and that can help you in all areas of your life.

In conclusion, I totally agree with Waldo Emerson that unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. It's important to challenge yourself and try new things, because it helps you develop new skills and abilities, discover new talents and passions, and develop a growth mindset. So, don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try something new!",1,llama2_chat,0
"Would you like someone to be able to read your emotions? Reading someone's emotions ican help you know that they need some help. Here are some reasons why it is good to be able to read emotions.

Reading the emotions of someone is amazing and should be used. In the article, Dr. Huang stated, ""The facial expresions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varing degrees of expression."" This shows why it is important to know how people feel when they are being taught something they don't understand.

Reading a person's emotions can be complicated when you're with a friend. The article states, "" She's (The Mona Lisa) 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This says that when The Mona Lisa was painted, she had 4 different emotions. When your with friends, it is unclear how they feel.

This research shows why it is necesary to read the emotions of somebody to know how they feel. This face reading software can help people who need help but can't tell others how they feel. Using software to read friends emotions can show you when they need your help.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 I'm super excited to write this essay about why knowledge is more important than imagination. I know, I know, it might seem like a weird topic, but hear me out! 🤔

First of all, let's talk about what knowledge is. Knowledge is like having all the facts and information about something. It's like having a superpower that helps you understand the world around you. Without knowledge, you wouldn't know how to do things like solve problems, make good decisions, or even communicate with others. 🤷‍♀️ Imagination, on the other hand, is like having a wild and creative mind. It's like being able to dream up all sorts of crazy and amazing things that don't exist in real life. 🌟

But here's the thing: while imagination is cool and all, knowledge is way more important in the real world. Think about it! Without knowledge, you wouldn't be able to do things like build a house, grow food, or even fix a broken toy. 🛠️ You need knowledge to survive and thrive in the real world. 🌟

For example, take the COVID-19 pandemic. Without the knowledge and information about the virus, we wouldn't have been able to develop vaccines or treatments to help stop it. 💉 And without the knowledge of how to properly wear masks and social distance, we wouldn't have been able to slow the spread of the virus. 🚫

Another example is in science and technology. Scientists and inventors need knowledge of the world around them to create new things and solve problems. 🔬 Without knowledge of physics, chemistry, and other sciences, we wouldn't have things like computers, smartphones, or even electricity! 💻💡

So, while imagination is definitely important for creativity and inspiration, knowledge is way more important for survival and success in the real world. 🌟💡 So, the next time you're brainstorming ideas or solving a problem, remember: knowledge is power!",1,llama2_chat,2
"Some schools require its students to complete summer assignments, this raises the question of whether these projects should be teacher-designed or students-designed? Which would be more beneficial to both the educator and the learner? Students would better benefit from completing an assignment structured by teachers because they have received an education on how to teach adolescents, understand where a student needs to be in their learning, and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about.

Summer assignments should be teacher-structured for many reasons, one of them being that the teachers have been educated on student learning. Before even being able to become an educator, teachers have to complete an education of their own; where they learn the most beneficial way to help another person understand something. Compared to an adolescent, who most likely isn't thinking the same way, it is clear that one will have much more success than the other in getting the lesson through. One is focused on how to get the point across as efficiently as possible and the other simply doesn't have the same thought process. The vigorous work done to obtain a teaching degree also ensure that those who are taught under the educator are not put in a stressful situation, learn at a comfortable speed, and are challenged just enough. Proving that teacher-designed assignments guarantee not only that the individual is learning, but learning effectively.

Another reason that proves why teacher-designed summer projects are more efficient is that the teacher better understands where a students is in their learning and where they should be by what time. For example, more experienced educators have seen quite a lot of different students with different learning patters and know how to manipulate that to the benefit of the student and themselves. This trait is most useful in a situation that the students in a class are in completely different areas in their understanding. The teacher is then able to build projects that are unique to each individual's strengths and weaknesses. Which consequently allows the class to collectively reach the same high level of understanding, all while working individually.

It is impossible for a student to design an project about a topic that they dont' already know about. Teachers should be the one's structuring the summer assignment because they are able to give the learner an unknown topic that could even possibly interest them. A student-designed project serves no purpose in assuring that a student will continue learning, but only review materials that they have already learned. Giving teachers control over the project prompts the student to research unfamiliar topics and further educate themselves. This small, but important change in the project designer completely decides whether a student will go on with a solid understanding of the class or forget the only half of the material that they learned.

Although one could argue that student-designed summer assignment have their own benefits the better option are teacher-designed assignments. These summer projects are better structured because the teachers have received and education on how to teach adolescents, they understand where a student needs to be in their learning, and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about. This structure is also beneficial because it doesn't allow the student to create anything that isn't challenging and even makes it easier on the teacher with grading. For these reasons, summer assignments should be designed by teachers and not the students.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Winston Churchill's famous statement, ""success is marked by failure,"" is a powerful reminder that achieving one's goals in life and solving problems is not always a smooth and easy process. In fact, it is often through our failures that we learn the most and ultimately find success. In this essay, I will analyze and discuss how Churchill's statement relates to achieving one's goals in life and solving problems.

Firstly, Churchill's statement highlights the importance of failure as a learning opportunity. Failure is often seen as a negative thing, something to be avoided at all costs. However, Churchill's statement suggests that failure is not something to be feared, but rather something to be embraced. When we fail, we are presented with an opportunity to learn from our mistakes and improve ourselves. By learning from our failures, we can ultimately find success in the future.

Secondly, Churchill's statement emphasizes the idea that success is not always a straight line. Rather, it is often a winding path, full of twists and turns. This means that achieving our goals and solving problems is not always a simple or straightforward process. We may encounter obstacles and setbacks along the way, but it is through these challenges that we ultimately find success.

Furthermore, Churchill's statement suggests that success is not just about achieving our goals, but also about how we handle failure. It is not enough to simply succeed; we must also learn from our failures and use them to grow as individuals. This means that we must be resilient and persistent in the face of adversity. We must be able to bounce back from failure and continue to move forward towards our goals.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill's statement that ""success is marked by failure"" is a powerful reminder that achieving one's goals in life and solving problems is not always a smooth and easy process. Rather, it is often through our failures that we learn the most and ultimately find success. We must embrace failure as a learning opportunity, be resilient and persistent in the face of adversity, and use our failures to grow as individuals. By doing so, we can achieve our goals and find success in all areas of our lives.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"I bleive that driverless cars should be developed because we are at a new age in time and we need to upgrade. To start upgrading the world lets strat with new technology in the cars that we drive.

In the world we live in today we drive ordinary cars that were made for ordinary people. Lest beging looking at the companies that are making the cars, are they great at manufacturing, is their reputation high, and are they expected to make the world a better place, Yes. Many futurists said that in order to have smarter cars we would have to have smart roads as well.

IN the 1950s, GM created an test track with an electric cable that sent radio signals to a recieverat the front of the car. Others have tried this, but they had a different mathod. Engineers at barkeley used magnets with alternating polarity, such as sensors. we ues sensors today to give human like senses to an object. I believe the number one reason for putting sensors on an car was to see if they could make a car drive as if a real human was in side controlling it.

If the car was always driving by itslef wouldn't the driver get very board and lose focus off while in traffic. Yes they would, which is why they have decided to put in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays for drivers that get distracted easily. These heads-up specialties are a great use of our technology because we have created them to help us with our new technology, we are a technology reliant community. ",0,persuade_corpus,4

"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" to show that limiting car usage helps to ""reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes..."" Their goal is to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being released into our atmosphere because it is destroying Earth. The gases are destroying the ozone layer drastically, and if this continues Earth will be gone. She also wrote ""The End of Car Culture"" explaining that the number of cars bought has reduced, bu in reality it is a good thing because it reduces the amount of pollution in the air, and money could be used on something more productive. Cars have not been the main priority of in America. People began to carpool, ride bikes, ride the bus, etc. This will ""save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Additionally, Robert Duffer writes ""Paris bans driving due to fog"" explaining how ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals..."" In Paris, many people are using cars, and they release the bad smoke into the atmosphere. By all the gases being combined together, it creates smog which is deadly. It can cause many health problems to humanlife and the nature. Another article to support that it is better off to limit car usage is ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. Selsky quotes a business man Carlos Arturo, ""'It's a good oppurtunity to take away stree and lower air pollution.'"" Even citizens agree that it is necessary for people to limit how much they drive because it streeses people out. They don't have to worry about spending a drastic amount of money on gas, or repairing the car. It is easier just to ride a bike which helps you save money, and even get a good execrise. It also limits air pollution because less cars are being driven and not alot of harmful gases are being released. Overall, there are benefits in not having a car.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal:

I believe that cell phones cause problems when students are using them during class for texting, or going on the internet. However, they are very important for a student to have during the day. That is why I think Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, is the best policy.

The main reason why I think that policy 1 is better is because the students may need their phone if they need some way to communicate with their parents before and after school. The students may need it if they find out their sport's practice is canceled, and they don't have a ride. They may also need to contact someone if there is some sort of emergency and they need help.

However, students may also need their phones during the day as well. My older sister is a freshmen this year, but when she started at high school, she often times got lost so she would call her friends and ask them for help. Another important reason that students should be allowed to have their phones during the day is if they aren't feeling well and they need to come home for the rest of the day, they can call their parents or a friend to come pick them up.

I believe that if a student is taking advantage of there privilege of even having a phone at school, and they are using it for social purposes, it should be taken away. But if a student does get caught, the teacher that confiscated it should return it to the owner after that class period. If a certain teacher is having problems with too many students having their phones out during class time, they should have every student place their phone at the far corner of their desk so the teacher can see everyone's phone and make sure no one is being distracted by them.

If you use policy 2, I believe that students will feel like they have to sneak their phones into class, and that may cause a bigger problem. If students start taking in their phones secretly, more and more of them may get used to it and eventually start taking them out during class and you will end up in the same situation you are in right now. If you end up in this situation again, you will have to make more policies.

Sincerely,

"To limit car usage, can bring some positive impacts to our world. Many countries such as Germany or France are adopting this act to better their community. Some benefits are the reduction of traffic, a smaller chance of car crashes and injuries, reduction of polution and appreciating whats around you already instead of being couped up in a car. People now are replacing driving with riding bikes, hiking or walking to where they want to get to or just car pooling with a friend.

In Germany, Heidrun Walter (media trainer and mother of two) says ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" She walks the verdant streets where you can here the passing of bicycles and chatter of the children hanging around and roaming the streets. To ensure that there is a reduction in car usage in the Vauban streets of Germany, drivways and home garages are considered forbidden. If you wish to own a car you'd need to by a large garage and the edge of the development where you buy a space for $40,000, along with a home.

In Paris, France, they enforced a partial driving ban to cleanse the air of the city. Motorist with an even numbered licenced plate were told to laeve their cars at home or they'd have to pay a $31 fine, also with even numbered plates. After this was done, the congestion went down 60 percent, after 5 days of smog in the air. The reasons why France did this was because they blamed the amount of gasoline coming from the cars. The smog got out of control so they decided to limit car usage.

In America, the reduction of car usage is also going down. People are depending more on biking, or walking to their designation or catching a ride with a friend. New york has a new bike sharing program along with bridge and tunnel tolls which refelct those new priorities. In source 4, the author and another citizen have similar traits with their children and cars. Mr. Sivak's son owns a car but prefers to take the Bay Area Rapid Transit.  The authors chidlren didnt bother getting a drivers license even though they live in places where they should have one. They dont think having a car is a necesity. They'd rather stick with their jobs, take public transportaions and just walk or car pool to where ever they please to have their social life.  Limiting car usage has many more beneficial ways to communities, and it is being adopted in numerous places.            ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"School is one of the most talked about and very differently viewed topics of today, some people like the idea of waking up early, going to school, and learning in tons of different ways. That's a select few people, but, most don't see a reason to coming to school and learning like that when you can learn the way you want too and have a school schedule that best fits you. Schooling online is great because it can be more relaxing and help with time management, it gives kids time to work on their own and pace themselves how they see fits best to their academic needs, and it allows freedom to express how they learn the best without fear of judgement from peers.

School from home can be more relaxing because kids don't have to worry about missing the bus or driving to school on time. Kids can get up and get a good amount of sleep without rushing to get ready within a certain amount of time. It allows kids to also practice and get a good grip on time management, if kids are running off to school and have an hour or so to get ready, it's just a daily routine. However if kids are waking up at a decent time and starting school when they want, while juggling other things during the day like a job, chores, or family/friend events it teaches them how to get done what needs to be done and still have enough time in the day for them to relax and rest.

School can sometimes be a fast paced enviornment for a majority of kids and most don't get a chance to work at a pace that they want and is most comfortable to them. Schooling from home, kids are able to work at the fast or slow pace that they prefer, it just depends on the person. Although, there could also be a downfall to this considering the fact that some kids could hold assignments off until the last minute and eventually fall behind, but, every action has a risk and the same situation happens in school everyday, so, it just depends on the person and how committed they are to doing well in school, getting good grades, and staying on task. Pacing yourself and actually having the ability to pace yourself goes a long way for some kids.

Kids in schools nowadays feel pressured to one; not be themselves because of how they'll be judged; but, also they feel the need to resist asking questions or asking for help because it makes them look dumb or stupid. Schooling from home you have the freedom to ask for help to get you to better understand what it is you're learning. You have the freedom to be yourself and wear what you wanna wear and act how you wanna act because you don't feel the need to please people because you're home. Freedom is important and it shouldn't be limited because someone thinks it makes you stupid when you ask questions to help further your knowledge and education. Kids needs to have freedom to help them grow and learn more about who they are. Although, schools encourage kids to be who they are and learn how they want, it doesn't always work like that.

So in conclusion, schooling from home has many great benefits and also some perks like it can be more relaxing and help with time management, it gives kids time to work on their own and pace themselves how they see fits best to their academic needs, and it allows freedom to express how they learn the best without fear of judgement from peers. School is always gonna be a topic everybody has a different views and opinions on, but, that's just how life is, if someone doesn't agree with you that's perfectly fine. School has so many different aspects, rules, systems, and processes depending on if you're homeschooled, attending a private school, or going to a public school, choose whichever works best for you because at the end of the day, that's all that really matters.               ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Annoyingly-Repetitive commercials, constant news interviews, and a myriad of kisses on the cheeks of stangers babies occur every 4 years. Its been the same process since the start of this country to aid in electing new presidents Designed in eloquence by our founding fathers. On the contrary I do strongly believe that the electoral college was on the lesser side of this eloquence. The grueling process, the unfairness and the overall confusion provided by the electoral college in my opinion make this ""electoral college"" one of the most unintelligent lesser thought out compromises that this country has ever had to abide by.

The electoral college is tiring, The process downright-grueling, and overratedly-outdated. As Americans using the electoral college keeps us hidden. We believe we have a voice when in reality the ""voice"" that we thought we had is barely above a whisper. According to the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" the author Bradford Plumer states that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This  statement provdided by the author suggests that something so simple-sounding turns out to be so complicated. By Americans placing a vote not for themselves but for the electors it is now not in the peoples hands like the government patronizes, even though you may put in a vote to elect a democratic canidate you never know who your state assigned electors might actually vote for, are you tired yet?

In Addition, its unfair to the presidential candidates. Although a presidential candidate may be well liked by people and ""win"" by popular vote that does not nessasarily mean the win in the presidency Although I understand the vfact that using the electoral college ensures a winner and avoids run-off elections I still do believe that this process is highly incompotent. The article by Plumer gives the example of the fact that in the 1960's segragationists almost succedeed in fully replacing democratic electors with electors of their choice or in essence ones that opposed of Kennedy. For candidates who place their blood sweat and tears into an election just to have lost by some electors but happend to be well-liked by people is foolish. America is supposed to be a country of the equal, and with the use of the electoral college is the perfect example of why  this country could not be any farther away from equal.

Furthermore, the process is confusing. Between the electors, voting and the overall uncertainty it is not worth it. Going through unneeded stress just to further confuse people is idiotic. The presidential election should be elected by popular vote and the goverment shall see to it that the peoples votes are actually counted towards something. I honestly do not believe that the title of ""land of the free, home of the brave should be given to a place where the government can not even see that this scheme no longer works. Its tiring, unfair, and confusing ; all red flags that this process is in need of some serious fine tuning.

In essence the electoral college is dead. Cheating people out of their rights is dead, and schemery is dead. Our government needs a serious wake up call. They need to open their eyes to the fact that this process is no longer effective and we are not that impressionable as the ones who were before us. The electoral college needs to be laid to rest and we should be alotted all the rights that we have not recieved from this grueling, confusing,  unfair process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"I do not participate in the sports and not very many activities so this does not really affect me. But this is still not very fair because the students grades are C's. The students do like the sports and activities but it is too hard for them to reach grades above a C. The students should be able to decide whether they need C's or B's and they will most likely choose C's.

This change could help bring the students grades up but it also might not. If the change were to happen there is a 50% chance that the students will try to get B's. But there is a chance the students wont even try to get the B's. The students might decide to not even try to get grades unless the policy stays at the C grade average.

The students will dislike the new policy very much so it is a good idea not to change it. If a majority of the students that try out for the sports, and the students that enter the activities already have B's then i would say go ahead and change the policy. but if a majority has C's the i would keep it the same.

You, the principal, should try out the new policy for a month and if grades start going up to B's for the sports and activities keep the new policy, but if grades don't go up or they start going down change it back to the original policy.

"When someone needs advice, would it be beneficial for them to ask more than one person? Since people have different beliefs, opinions, and understandings, they do not think the same way all of the time. There are numerous reasons why getting advice from multiple people can be advantageous including some people could be more educated in the topic than others and every person will have a different perspective.

One reason why asking multiple people for advice could help someone make a decision is because one person might have a better understanding of the topic than the others who have been asked. If someone who does not know much about the topic is asked, they might not give the best, up-to-date answer. However, someone who is knowledgeable in that specific area will probably be able to connect with the subject and give better advice to help. For example, if someone asks what color the sky is, one person could say it is red, and another person could say that it is purple, but a scientist that was asked could say that it is blue. The scientist would be more educated on this subject. Therefore, they would be able to provide the more helpful answer. If the one asking had only talked to one person, it is more likely that they would get an incorrect answer or a response that is not as beneficial. Overall, asking multiple people for advice could benefit someone by providing them with a better, more educated answer.

Another reason why getting advice from multiple people could be advantageous is because every person that is asked will feel differently about the topic. Some people will feel positively about the topic while others feel negatively. People have their own opinions and their opinions are how they form an answer. For instance, if someone asks someone else for advice on where they should go for dinner, the action relies on the answer that the person gives. If they say that they should go to a certain restaurant, it could be because the person giving advice likes that restaurant. On the other hand, if the person asks multiple people, they will get a variety of answers because everybody has a different opinion. The more people that someone asks, the more answers that they will get. Therefore giving them a plethora of opinions to base their choice off of.

There are many reasons why someone should ask multiple people for advice including getting a more educated answer and receiving different opinions. Asking more than one person would provide someone with better advice and a variety of answers. Whether somebody asks two or five people, all of the answers that are given will lead them to make better choices.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The Sun is blazing, the sky is blue, and school is out. What more do students want? Once summer starts school books are thrown to the back of the closet, never to be seen until the next year. This worries schools since when students aren't learning during the summer then classes have to be provided for students to relearn everything they forgot. This led schools to develop summer projects so that their students will learn during the summer. However, issues started to arise of how they should be designed. Some say teachers should design it and others say that students should design it. Although teacher-designed summer projects would help set guidelines so that the students can learn as much as they can, student-designed projects will let the students showcases their creativity.

When designing the summer projects, teachers most definitely would set guidelines for students to help them, when they get stuck. However, what teachers don't realize is that by setting guidelines they are really restricting the student's creativity. They are limiting what the students can do and for the students to get a good grade on the projects, they would base their entire project on those guidelines. Which would mean they aren't really learning. These set guidelines would correspond with the topics that the teacher assigns. The assigned topics would focus on the materials the students need the most help in. Which in reality is forcing the students to learn. When someone is forced to do something they aren't interested in doing, they wouldn't usually put their full effort in to completing that task. This is the same for students too. By forcing the students to do these projects and not letting them chose what topic to do, the students wouldn't put all their effort in the project. This represents that the students aren't actually learning. This would be the opposite effect of what the summer projects were intended to do.

If the students were to, however, design the projects instead, then the issue of them not learning would be avoided. By making the students design their own projects, they are able to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills. Most students, during school, have a difficult time demonstrating what creativity they have. However, by giving them this chance to design their own projects the students can really put their full heart into it since they would actually have interest in the topic. By being able to design their own projects students can also develop new skills, like leadership. Leadership is when someone is able to take charge in a difficult situation. The students would be able to represent this when they have to take charge to develop their own project based off the topic they chose. Having the ability to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills, students would be able to fully grasp what their learning. Schools then wouldn't have to worry about assigning classes so the students can relearn everything they forgot, since when school starts in the fall students would be ready to tackle new topics.

When it comes to demonstrating why students should design their own projects, schools should look towards the science fair. The science fair is a student-designed project that every student has to do, at least once, in their high school or middle school life. The science fair makes students pick a topic that their experiment would be based off of. When picking the topic, the student is showcasing their creative side since they aren't restricted on what topic to pick. During the experiment process, students are able to develop research skills for when they have to write their background paper on their hypothesis. Since they would need to find respected articles that relate to their hypothesis. Students would also be developing their leadership skills since when doing their experiment things can go wrong and they have to take charge and figure out why. At the end of the science fair process, students can then really grasp the understanding of the scientific design process and how to develop a well done experiment. This would all be possible since the science fair is a student designed project. If the teacher were to design the project and pick the topics, students would have never been able to fully understand the scientific design process.

Schools should make the summer projects student-designed since it allows students to showcase their creative side. Even if having them teacher-designed would help set guidelines the students can look back at when stuck. By having teachers design the projects, students are going to be restricted and aren't going to be able to really learn since they won't be putting all their effort into the project. This would all be avoided if students were to design the projects themselves, because they won't be restricted and instead they would put all their effort into the project. At the end, students would be developing new skills and getting to actually learn. A perfect example is the science fair, where students are made to design their own experiments so that they can understand the scientific design process and how to properly make a experiment. Schools should trust their own students for their own learning at certain times. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"There are many ways a person can get from one place to another whether it is by bus, plane, train or car. Car and truck transportation is one of the leading causes in air polution. Ruducing the use of cars will be beneficial to the public, not only on the streets, but to the citizens themselves.

To start off, the reduction of cars on the streets will cause less stress to the people who drive them. For example, in Source 1 it shows how a woman is happier and the loss of her car has changed her life for the better. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" she says. The tension of being in a car and waiting in traffic can be stressful and cause people to get impatient, grumpy, and even irritated. The woman proves that her life has changed because she doesn't have to go through that anymore. Her car-less life is the one that makes her happy.

Besides that, not only does car reduction cause better mood for people, but it also lessens the air pollution and makes the enviornment cleaner and better for people to live in. According to Source 4, ""If the pattern persists- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" This proves that when cars are being used less, there is also less carbon emission into the air and that is helpful to the enviornment. This benefits and makes the air cleaner and safer to breathe.

Now with every thing good, there is always a bad. In source 2 it is explained how the delivery companies were complaining of lost revenue. Yes, this will be a problem with the delivery companies, but there are other ways of transporting goods to their destination such as by train, boat etc. Also in Source 2 there were arrangements made for the the cars to go out on certain days, so the delivery companies' problems were not all that bad. The reduction of cars benefits the public more than it what it hurts.

The results of limiting car usage has been greatly proven through studies done (in source 4) and it is believed that it should continue to be limited and or reinforced. The people are happier, the enviornment is safer and the air is clean. There is more help than there is hinder and soon it will be seen throughout the world that cars are better in the garage.                       ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"There are a lot of things that develop and hold a Electoral College together. There are also a lot of down falls to the Electoral College. Every state has 1 House of Representative plus 2 of your Senators in the Electoral College. There are a total of 538 people but 270 of them is the majority vote that wins. There are a total of 5 reasons why we have to keep this method to choosing the president. The 5 ways are Certainty of outcome,Everyone's President,Swing States,Big States and Avoid Run-Off Elections.

The main reason we have a Electoral College is so they have a right way to choose a president. The main reason for this is so that we dont leave our electing in the hands of foriegn people/immiagrants. The is what the president needs to get elected in the electoral college. There are still a lot of down falls to this method of the electoral college though. One of these issues is ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voter"". This means ""winner takes all"" which is they only focus on the bigger states and not the smaller ones because the bigger states have bigger population which means they have more in the electoral college. Another issue with this method is that the person thats running for president might get the popularity vote but still not win. See everyone that votes isnt really voting directly for the president, the people who really count is the electoral college. In order to win the vote you have to convice the electoral college and thats not always easy. So remember just because you won popular vote doesnt mean you won the majority of the electoral vote.

There are 5 reasons why we keep this method of electing the president. The first reason is Certainty of Outcome. This means ""it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote."" Which really means the candidates share to the other people in the Electoral college there share of the popular vote and thats how they vote. The second reason is Everyone's President. This is basically shows that ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" This means that no region such as south,northwest,etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The third resone to keeping these methods is Swing States. This tells me that its the ""winner takes all method."" The fourth method why we should keep these methods is the Big States. This explains that ""the Electoral College restores some of the wieght in the political balance."" this means that the bigger states get a big advantage in the electoral because the people that get elected into office there is based off of population so they have an advantage. THe bigger states get more attention from the candates then the smaller states do. The final reason why we should keep this method of voting is Avoid Run-Off Elections. This means ""the Electoral College aviods the problem of Elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast"". This means no pressure for candidates when they win majority of the votes cast.

There are many ways to develop and to hold the Electoral College together. There are many ways that it falls apart and has it flaws but its the best way for our econany to vote for president. If you think about it if we just did popularity vote that would be like leading our hands into a world of immigrates who know a very little. There a lot of rules for our Electoral process buyt its the best way and the only way we have to becoming a better place. Dont forget to look at the 5 reasons we keep this the way it is.

"As an 8th grader, I think it's super interesting to think about finishing high school early versus the traditional four-year timeframe. Like, I know some people who are really smart and can finish school early, but I'm not sure if it's the best choice for everyone.

So, one advantage of finishing high school early is that you can get a head start on your college education. Like, you can take college classes while you're still in high school, and that can save you money and time in the long run. Plus, you might be more mature and ready for college-level work, so you could potentially do better in college. That's pretty cool, right?

But, there are also some risks to finishing high school early. Like, you might not have as much time to figure out what you want to do after high school, and you might miss out on some important experiences that you would have had if you stayed in high school for four years. Plus, you might not have as much time to develop your social skills and make friends, which could make college harder.

I think the traditional four-year high school experience has its own advantages, too. Like, you get to learn and grow with your friends, and you have more time to figure out what you want to do after high school. Plus, you get to experience all the different classes and activities that high school has to offer, which can help you find your passion.

So, I think it's important to think about your own goals and needs when deciding whether to finish high school early or not. If you're really smart and can handle the workload, finishing early might be a good choice for you. But, if you're not sure what you want to do after high school or if you want to have more time to develop your social skills, maybe it's better to stick with the traditional four-year experience.

Overall, I think it's important to think carefully about your options and make the choice that's best for you. Finishing high school early can be a good choice for some people, but it's not the right choice for everyone.",1,llama2_chat,0
"Remember in elementary school you used to get summer reading logs and checks on books you were 'required' to read during your break? Some students never had a problem with these types of assignments because they loved to read any chance they could get. Unfortunately, there were also the kids who would dread reading and give up after ten minutes or pretend they did the entire assignment. Though at this age, it really didn't matter whether or not you did the reading logs, it was just a little nudge your school would give you to do summer learning. However, when students reach higher levels of school, especially around high school, the requirement of summer projects is actually a requirement. Lots of students complain that it is unfair to do assignments over the one, long break they receive, but depending on the class subject it is for, sometimes these projects are essential. Schools must be aware that if summer projects are always going to be required, the assignments should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed because students will have more urge to do them and sometimes the projects can interfere with summer plans, making it troublesome to get work done.

Summer is the only substantially long break that students receive off of homework, assignments and tests. Through the months of August until June, school does not cease. Almost every week, robotic-like students must wake up early Monday morning, suffer through eight hours of sitting and listen to a teacher go on about something like, why did the War of 1812 happen, how to dissect a frog, or solve for x. Five days are filled with this repeating schedule with two days to spare, and in my experience one of those days is set aside for weekend homework. No matter how much someone loves school and learning, eventually they need a break. Summer is the time to cut loose, hang out with friends, travel somewhere you've never been before and relax. Almost everyone has seen in a movie how students throw their books and papers up in the air as soon as that last day bell rings. Imagine receiving a final project the last day of school, requiring students to turn in on the first day of their next year of school. Now if that project was teacher-designed it might require a student to: 'write an eight page essay on the effects of propaganda use in your society' or 'create a tri-fold and 3-D display of a past, indigenous, tribe's village'. Just picturing these assignments make some people cringe. However, if summer projects were student-designed, people could create a piece of work that interests them and hopefully enables them to put in more effort on the assignment because it wouldn't feel as much like a school task. Student-designed projects could focus on what students question or wonder about in their day to day lives, peaking their interests and making the task feel more fun and creative. Students could receive a broad outline like 'write an essay' or 'create a display', and turn it into a unique piece that expresses themselves; something like a paper on endangered animals.

During summer a lot of trips and vacations are taken whether with family or friends, near or far. Nevertheless, each one requires people to leave their homes and travel with the minimal amount necessary to save space. In my experience, I once was gone for almost the entire summer. One week I was in Pennsylvania with my relatives and the next I was swimming in the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas. Now imagine if these vacations, no matter how long the duration, were to be taken away from students because of a teacher-designed, summer project. If one was to receive a project of this type, there is no way of telling how much time or the location required to get it done. For example, if teachers were to design a summer research paper on the history of where you live, it might be necessary to go to the public library to view history records. No one can do that or go there if they're skiing all the way in Colorado. Student-designed projects allow students to create a work period and timing schedule for when doing the assignment works best for them. This way they can coordinate when their prior to summer planned vacations are being taken and when they will be home or around an area that will allow them to get work done. Students planning their projects and work time around summer could mean multiple things. For example, when they will be home to create a display, whether the hotel they stay at will have wifi to get on the internet, or even who they will be with to conduct an interview if the project requires that. A lot of the projects teachers design don't put into aspect all these factors.

Some, especially teachers, might argue that having students design their own summer projects will lead to the minimal work necessary and a poorly done assignment. Teachers might say that students are primarily focused on their summers and just having fun, rather than getting something done that could benefit them in their next school year. However, if the project is required for school, that typically means it is graded. Students won't try to do the least amount work possible just to save them time, if that means they will earn a D on the project. They will start the year off poorly. The overall effect of the project will outweigh how much time and effort is put into it.

Overall, student-designed projects would be more beneficial for both teachers and students because these types of assignments create a unique idea of who you are as a person because it shows individual interests. If a project was deemed boring and just based on facts, teachers would be more likely to receive non creative and possibly plagiarized work. Students wouldn't care to try their best because this one task is taking time out of their long awaited break from school. In addition, student-designed projects also allow teachers assigning them, to have a sense of who their incoming students are, based on their projects.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Planning a summer project can be a difficult task for anyone. However, for school summer projects, teachers should be the ones to plan out a summer project for the students. Teacher's have been proven to more knowledgeable then their younger counterparts. Teachers are just overall more knowledgeable about how to teach their students.

In order for teachers to better prepare their students for their class; a summer project is best left to the teachers to plan out. The reason being that teachers should have a pretty good idea of they should be teaching for that year's education. Centering the project on what teachers will be teaching; would better help understand where their students stand on certain subjects of that class. Not to mention, teachers also have more experience in what students should be learning because at one point they were students themselves.

Being a teacher most certainly means that teachers have gone through learning experiences that they thought had gone well, or maybe had thought classes could have been taught using better methods. Teachers can then apply what they have learned from previous learning experiences ,and either take or improve upon them.

Then, we have the most obvious reason why student shouldn't come up with their own summer projects. Student have time and again proven that they push off or be become lazy doing certain tasks. This may not be the case for all student, however it is the majority. Another reason why students may not be able or be good at planning projects, is because they may be simply to busy doing other activities. Some example of these activities are sports, having a job, visiting collages, or planning out what they want to do for a career. Students may just simply not have enough time to plan out what they want to do for a project; where as for a teacher. It is their job to plan out what students should be doing in or for their classes.

Those are the reasons on why teachers are better equipped to plan out summer projects and not students. Teacher's can pull from previous learning experiences to apply to how they want to teach students. Students could outright just be lazy or to busy to plan out assignments. Then the obvious fact that teachers have just learned more ways because they are older.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I have a couple reasons for saying that. First, under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who ends up voting for the president. Second, you have to worry about the ties in the electoral vote.

First off, under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who ends up voting for the president. So that means you actually don't get to vote for the president you want, the electors get to vote for the  president they want and their choice might not be the same as yours. Here's an example that was in Source 1, ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" So you don't actually get to vote for a president. Also, in source 2, it states that the electoral college is unfair to voters because of how each state has the winner-take-all system, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

Second, you have to worry about the ties in electoral vote. Source 2 states that if a tie happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The senate would choose the vice-president. The state delegations may not vote for the president you want and the senate may not vote for the vice-president you want either.

I think the Electoral College process is a bad idea and it should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. Electoral college is unfair to voters and I think it should be gotten rid of.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Some schools offer distance schooling for students to be able to learn from home, and would they benefit from it. Should more schools do this where you live. Here are some advantages to schools that do this.

One advantage to doing distance learning is there is no traveling. Students donÃÂ´t have to come to school everyday, and there parents donÃÂ´t have to bring them either. It is just allot less running around for the students and parents. They dont have to get up so early just to go to school. You just get right out of bed and get your work done.

Schools are doing it now so kids can spend more time with their family. They have to go to school for 8 hours a day ,then come home to spend little time with the family. Kids need that family time rather then going to school all day. The parents can help them do the work if needed. Just getting more support then at school.

I feel like if kids did their work at home they would get more work one. They dont have here friends there to distract them. They can have more time if needed to finish work rather than at school it has to be turned in at a specific time. If they got more work done hat means they would have better grades. Just make them have a better work ethic.

So after hearing about the advantages to doing distance learing would you like it if your school did it. I feel like it would be a btter idea in the long run for syudents to get more freedom while they are still getting their work done.             ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Cell phones are simply too distracting even for the most talented enough most experienced driver enough to drive and chew gum. I feel like Unless Bluetooth is built into the car and designed to operate as a vehicle accessory much like a radio or windshield washer control I done see a problem with being on the phone while driving because it is hands free.

But we are being our own worst enemies when it comes to driving while on the phone it is Hard to that everyone knows at least one accident caused by using a cell phone while driving even if you can walk and chew gum at the same time, gum chewing is an unconscious activity. Talking on a phone and driving are not. People who think they are as alert talking on a cell phone and driving are probably the same people who think one, two or three drinks doesn't dumb down their driving skills.

I follow many drivers, of all ages, who start slowing down considerably or start swerving in traffic and there are not even young like me they are older people that could be the age of my parents that are driving reckless while on the phone like when they are looking for their phones to answer them, to call someone, or to text someone. This causes braking from everyone else that causes unnecessary crashes from everyone else. Cell phone use and driving is a distraction no matter who is doing it.

"Why is the world the way it is? Is it this way because one person had one idea that the rest of the world followed or is it this way because multiple people have collaborated and asked for advice overtime? Throughout history many people have come together and shared ideas that have changed the world. For example, many scientists have invented things like the microscope and the space shuttle, and these inventions were created through a few people coming up with one idea and then asking for more opinions and advice from others. Because these incredible scientists worked together, we have these inventions in today's world. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision or plan because more points of view will be provided and less mistakes will be made.

One reason why asking for advice is very useful is because it can provide different points of view. For instance, when a student is choosing electives for school they might ask their parents if they are making the right decisions. Children and adults have very different perspectives, so the student's parents would most likely give different ideas then the student had thought of. Although people sharing ideas from different perspectives can sometimes lead to disputes and arguments, most people asking for advice have open minds and are willing to listen to different thoughts. However, receiving multiple points of view isn't the only reason people should ask for advice.

Another reason people should ask for advice is because asking can help them identify mistakes. People often overlook important details while creating an idea or making a choice, but when they ask for advice the people they ask can help them identify their flaw. For example, when people are planning a party they might forget to choose the kind of cake they are going to buy. When they ask a peer for advice their peer can point out their mistake, or the person planning the party will talk through their plan with the individual they asked for advice from and realize their flaw. Many mistakes will be avoided by people seeking for advice.

In order to make the best decisions possible, mankind must learn to ask for advice from others. Asking for advice can help change the world in a positive way because the decisions people make will most likely have a good outcome for the community around them. Seeking advice before making choices and plans is very important because mistakes can be avoided and different opinions can be heard.      ",0,persuade_corpus,0

"The use of Facial Action Coding System could be a good thing to use in school. It also can be used for help better how teacher do things. At can also help a pyschologist find students with problems or mental issues. Another good use for it is could help the students in there ability to act in acting classes.

First reason why it could be a good thing for schools is that you can use the system to check if the students are bored or confused, so you can change how a teacher teaches in a different style. It also could change how the students learn. In the text I says this '' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'' It would be good to use to help students learn what are some of facial expression and learning what muscle cause that movement.

Another reason why it would be good to use the system is to use in acting class. A lot of school have classes such as acting, drama, and threater. How this would benfit a student is it would help then try to get the facial expression that they would need for a certain part in acting or in play it also and help produce emotions. In paragraph 9 it says this '' according to the facial feedback theory emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotion but it aslo may even help produce them.'' Then it goes on to say ''constantin stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way to createing these emtions on stage''.

Finally another reason why it would be good to use the facial coding system is it would help the school psychologists if there is a student is having problems and they are hiding their problems . If would help alert the pyschologist if they are going threw depression or suicidal thoughts. it would help the pyschologist so they find a way to make them happy so they do good in school and keep track of what they are doing. In paragraph 5 it says this '' you van probably tell how a friend is felling simply by the look on her face. Of course most of us would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried etc.''

So with conclusion these are some the reason why it would be good to use Facial Action Coding System. It would be for schools to think about these option and what it can do for students. Thank you for your taking your time to read this. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"TO PRINCIPALS WORLD WIDE

I believe that u should make a rule requiring all students to perform community service. I feel this way because it allows the student to help the community and give back to it as well. By not allowing this rule you will be giving the students more free time. And by doing that the student will be exposed to dangerous and life threatening things such as drugs, alcohol, and to being associated to gangs.

It will also give the student a good experience to take part of. For example, all students need the hours to graduate high school and it is a bonus because high schools and colleges look at the activities the student take part of after school. So you will be giving them a chance to have better and a more successful life. A student especially at a young age as in middle and elementary school needs guidance by doing community service. It will teach them discipline and guide them to making better life choices.

A student may believe doing community service is a waist of time. By them thinking that they are already going down the wrong road. A road of laziness and every thing being a waist of time. If you require for all students to take part in this community service it will allow them to become responsible and reliable adults. And allow YOU to make a difference on the world since the students are the future. Thank you for your time and open ears hopefully i have persuaded you to make it a requirement for students to take part in community service.

"Ring! Ring! The bell goes off and its time to go home, but wait the principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. So now you have to stay after school and cant go home until another two hours! I disagree with this decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because kids have chores, homework, some kids dont even like sports, and we might have other plans.

The first reason I disagree with this decision is because some students dont like sports. Students should'nt be forced to do something they dont want to do. Some kids arent good at sports or they just dont like sports, but either way they shouul'nt be forced to play them, its not fair. Also, if students are staying after school to do an extracurricular actvity they wont have any time to do homework or chores. For example if I stay after school for two extra hours, that means im getting home at five o'clock. By five o'clock, I wont have any time to vacuum, do dishes, or homework before its time for dinner.

Lastly, as a student who plays two sports I have a buisy schedule with my practices and If im forced to stay after school for an extracurricular activity it will interfere with my practices. Its not only sports thats this can interfere with, but it could also intefere with plans you have with your family. For example if you want to have dinner with your family at six o'clock you wont be able to because you'll be to buisy working on the yearbook at your school or serving on the student council.

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that becoming a better writer is an essential skill that will benefit me in various aspects of my life. To achieve this goal, I have taken several steps, including researching how to become a better writer, finding an experienced writer to work with, reading the story of Pele to gain inspiration, analyzing the key message behind Adidas's ""All in or Nothing"" phrase, reexamining my own life experiences to develop further insights on the importance of working on something to accomplish, and exploring my current weaknesses and practicing them to become better.

Firstly, I have researched how to become a better writer. I have found that there are several ways to improve my writing skills, including practicing regularly, reading widely, and seeking feedback from others. I have also learned that it is essential to have a clear understanding of grammar rules and to develop my own unique writing style.

Secondly, I have found an experienced writer to work with and practice my skills. I have been fortunate enough to work with a local writing coach who has helped me to identify my strengths and weaknesses and develop a plan to improve my writing. Through this process, I have gained valuable feedback on my writing and have been able to make significant improvements.

Thirdly, I have read the story of Pele to gain inspiration. Pele is widely regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time, and his story has been an inspiration to me.

Another reason is if students have to take a day off for a reason which could be being sick, family event, or just wanting to stay home. Taking the class online would stop them from getting behind in the class work and keeping up with everyone else in the class. Some say that the students should only be learning in the classroom should not have to take those matters in the home. Also if students missed school and could just take an online class to keep up. That would be a big reason for students to stay home and not come to school, because why deal with the stress of school when you have it all in your home.

Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus, schools all over the United States have already been reverting to online classrooms. In fact, our own county is deciding whether or not to take this action, as to not spread the disease and giving students the option to still get their education. If the option to not take classes online was not put into action, students would come into school and spread the virus to one another, and possibily pass it to one of own teachers and take it into our home.

Another reason that online classrooms would be useful to the education of students is if a student is absent from a day of school and has to make up work for the classes that day. Instead of waiting until the student is back at school to get the work that was missed, they can go to the online classroom and do the work that was due, as to not fall behind in the ciriculum.

In conclusion, online classrooms would benifit the education system tremendously because it would help students not fall behind on work that was missed when missing a day of school. Also help eradicate the spread of a deady disease continuing to plague the United States.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Students being home school can lead to some effects that would not benefit them at all.

Being home school would not allow students to interact with other students because there are no classmates with them. Students not being able to interact with others can lead to them being socically awkward when it comes to talking to others in certain situatuions. Having classmates around can be helpful to build up a friendship bond and also for students to be there for each other for help. Being able to express yourself with interactions is an important skill that can allow a student to give out an opinion about a certain topic. However, not all students have the courage to speak to others due to them being timid around others. Students being home school would not benefit them in their social life.

By staying home for school students may get too comfortable being there which can lead to them being pestemistic when it comes time to learning. Students need a learning environment that can help them learn and keep them distracted from other things around them. If a student attends a school with other classmates they can participate in many classroom activities that can help them understand the material in a better way. It is alway good for someone to try new things rather than sticking to one environment at all times. By staying home students would not be able to experience the life that a student that attends a school has.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If a home school student attended a school with classmates it would help develop social skills that will benefit them. Staying home and sticking to one environment is not beneficial because it prevents them from trying new activities and it can lead them to feel lazy when it comes to learning at home.                 ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Would you change history? Some people think that there some things that were made by our past Presidents should be changed. Such as our Electoral College, people say it should be changed to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. So we shouldn't change history we should keep the Electoral College.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A  majority of 270 electoral votes is requested to elect the president. Our states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. Now think about this if we were to go with this changing thing look at how many people would lose thier job. Therefore if the voting was by popular vote instead of by the Electoral College literally anybody could become President if there isn't anybody looking at it that knows what they are doing.

After the Presidential election,your governer prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respected electors. the Certificate shows that the winning Presidential candidate in your state and shows which will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. So without the Electoral College to make the decision of the President the governer can't make the ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" the other people and there respected electors won't get noticed for running.

Other people think that we should change the Electoral College to the election by popular vote. They think that under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors , who in turn elect the president. For instance, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for whoever, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to that person. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as anachronism,a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be[overuled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the part's nominee; however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservaative reasons 1) Certainty of Outcome 2) Everyone's President 3) Swing States 4) Big States and 5)Avoid Run-Off Election.               ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"i would want the electoral vote to be changed or to change the election by popular vote. Because the electoral college does have some things in it that are procieved as wrong and people want to change about it. And honestly i think i would be alot better if it was just the popular vote because then mre people would be satisfied with who their president is. Knowing that its someone they voted for ad not someone in which the electoral college votes for and decides to make the president. some presidents win the popular vote but still lose the presidency because they didnt get enough electoral votes. I would prefer a direct vote from popular votes.

I dont think it is that much fair if someone wins the popular vote but still dosent get picked to be the president because of the electoral college. In the electoral college voters dont vote for the president they vote for the state electors and thats not want they should be voting for they should be able to directly vote for the president that they want.

Dear Principal,

I think the idea of allowing students to have at least a B average is a good idea because many students tend to focus on just their sports, they may tend to have very bad grades, and wont qualify to pass the grade their in.

If we allow students to have a B average, students would focus more on their school work, because they would want to play their sports.

In order for them to play, they would have to focus more, thus giving better grades.

Secondly, students would tend to have bad grades because of sports.

If we set it for a B average, more kids would have to work harder for their grades because they want to play. Therefore students wont have bad grades.

Making it a B average can be an encourager towards students.

Lastly, if students are only making a C average, there's a small chance that the students will pass. If we make it where the grades must be a B average, students will improve their school work, making them have better grades.

Well thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you tend to see why changing the grading average for sports is necessary.

Remember though, students tend to focus on just their sports, they may tend to have very bad grades, and wont qualify to pass the grade their in.

Sincerely,

"Many people believe that the 'Face on Mars' was formed by aliens. What do you think? If you were told that the face on Mars was created by aliens, what would you do? What would you say? I know what I would do. I would call them crazy and explain to them that aliens do not exsist and that it was a fact of science.

The 'Face on Mars' is a natural landform. The light from the sun is shone across the landform to make it look like it has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth like a human person, but, if you were to create an exact copy of Mars, put on a different scale, hold it still, and shine light at the exact angle of the sun, you would see that the sun is what really causes the 'Face on Mars' to appear to look the way it does.

Aliens, if they exsisted, could not have created something so magnificent and perfect that at that angle it would look like a face. Scientists have studied the geography of Mars for years and have had nothing to say about aliens. They have prooven their facts and have given us reason to believe that this was simply the way Mars was stuctured and that the rays of the Sun are the cause of it looking like a face.

If aliens did create the 'Face on Mars', why would our scientist have not discovered them? Why havent we ever then seen one before? For those that believe that it was aliens that sculpted Mars, I am sorry, but you are wrong. Mars was naturally formed and can never and will never be changed by aliens because aliens simply do not exsist.

So, for all of those out there in our lovely world that think that aliens do infact exsist and that they somehow, over millions of years created a 'Face on Mars', I would like to say one last thing on my behalf, aliens do not exsist and could not have created something so mindblowing.

"I think that the students should be able to be in sport or other activities with a C average to start with. If they show that they are committed to the activities then the grade level should go up to a B average. If the students have something to do that they really like they will put there all into it. If the activities starts to pick up then the standards should be higher for the school work and grades. If they really care about the activities then they will make sure there school work is good. So they can stay in the sport or activity they are in . If there grades go down they should be cut out of the sport or club they are in. Until they get there grades back up to at least a C average then up to a B average.

The students will like that because it will give them something to do after school. Instead of being at home bored. They can have a sport or club activity to give them the chance to meet new friends and to stay out of trouble. Maybe before they go to there sport or activity they can sit down and do there homework . So the teachers know that the students are getting there work done. If no one has home work then they can sit down and read for about 15 minutes. To let them know that school work is more important than anything. I Think that would be a good way to compromise the situation.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some people might think after school actives are fun and some think not. Some principals think it is required for students to have an after school activity without thinking about how the students feel about after school actives. Students should have the right to choose weather to have and after school activity or not. Students should not have to participate in a extracurciuar activity after school because some students do not have the time, Not a student would like to be forced to do a after school activity, And not all students like to have an after school activity.

After a long day at school some students do not have the time to do an after school activity. They could have after school plans and can not do the activity they were supposed to do. Others have lots of homework to do after school although teachers say that would be a terrible excuse to say but every teacher does not know how much homework the kids have after they're class. Students after school might have to take care of a younger sibling or pet because their mother or father is at work or they could be doing something to help out their mother or father.

In many occasions students are force to do an after school activity chosen by the school district. Students are more likely to do the activity if they are to chose it instead of the school district. Because of the students disliking the activity they were assigned they would most likely to skip it and go on with they're day. so instead of forcing students to do an activity have options for them so they can pick for themselves.

Some students just do not like after school actives and they do not have a reason why they just don't. The students would rather study for and up coming test or quiz. They are stay at home kids they go to school and come back home to do whatever they need to do to pass school. Their is no explanation but they just dislike actives after school and if they do not like it then they should not be force to do something they do not want to do. they want to take the time to study and pass the grade instead of doing an after school activity.

After school actives can be every difficult to do for some students because some dont have the time, they would not like to be forced to do it,and some kids just do not like it at all. These are just some reasons on why not give after school actives to students but there are many more, people just do not think about how busy the life of a student is. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Many students have been either forced or pressured to do an extracurricular activity. They might be forced or pressured by a parent/guardian, teacher, or friend. However, that doesn't mean they should do the activity. The principal should not force students to participate in an extracurricular activity because, students might not have time to do an activity, might be forced to do an activity they don't like, or the activities might suffer.

While some students have plenty of extra time to use after school, some may not. Students can usually get their homework done either after school or during resource. Though, they don't always do it in a healthy way. Some have to stay up late to get an assignment done either because, they forgot when it was due, waited till the last minute to do it, didn't realize how big it was, or have a field trip or special event they are going to. This causes the student to not get a healthy amount of sleep, which causes them to have trouble paying attention in class. Also some students decide to take all honors classes, which usually give out more homework than normal classes. If the student has to deal with an after school activity on top of all of this, then they will have a very annoying schedule.

Sometimes parents force their kid to do an extracurricular activity. Usually the student either finds out that they enjoy the activity, or that they hate it. If they hate it they could ask their parents if they can stop doing the activity, but the parent could say no. Then the kid is stuck doing this activity even though they don't want to do it. The same problem can happen if a friend asks them to do an extracurricular activity with them. The kid might find out that they don't like the activity, but they don't want to upset their friend, so they continue to do the activity. If the principal says the students have to take an extracurricular activity, a few of the students might not want to do any of the possible activities. This would would mean at least a few students would be forced to do an activity they don't enjoy. If students are forced to take an extracurricular activity, then they could get stuck doing something they don't want to do.

There are hundreds of kids in a school. If the principal were to say that every student in the school has to do at least one extracurricular activity, it would be a mess. The after school activities that the school offers would be overflowing with students. If the school had only one team for each sport, the school would need to make a lot more. If more teams are made more equipment will be needed, which means the school would have to use more money. Also the teams themselves would suffer, because there are bound to be kids who don't even like the sport who are only there because they have to be. This could also happen with almost any other activity in the school. If students are forced to take an extracurricular activity, the activities will suffer.

If students are forced to participate in an extracurricular activity, students won't have enough time to do assignments, might be forced to do an activity they dislike, and the activities the school offers will suffer. Though it may seem like a good idea to have all the students do an extracurricular activity, it will be a pain for the students and the school.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Participating in extracurricular activities can reward you with many advantages. Schools provide many clubs and sports teams like debate club,football,etc. Having a hobby can help reduce electronic use which allows more productivity. Joining a curricular activity allows students to make new friends and find a new hobby. Extracurricular activities are important because it can help students decrease stress and help them become more engaged at school and life.

Students collect a lot of stress from workloads of homework to chores around the house. Joining a curricular activities can help relive that constant stress. Having joined a curricular activity relationships and trust are bonded between people in the club or team. Stress can break a student and many dont talk much about there worries or feelings. However,joining a club or sport can help students discuss with there mentors or close friends which help them feel more better about there situation.

Students tend to get distracted in school which can cause grades to drop. Being in a extracurricular activity can help students engage more in what they are learning in school. Students are with people who can help them out and want to see them succeed. They never feel left out and not cared for. Schools need students to have good grades in order for them to participate in extracurricular activities,so this allows students to be more motivated to be productive in school .

In conclusion, participating in extracurricular activities can help students become less worried and more intrested in the world around them. Student are more likely to be productive and socialize more. Motivation is key to help students succeed and, by participating in curricular actives students are more engage in being better.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"When we think of break, whether it's Spring, Summer or Winter, we tend to think of it as something where we can relax after a long period of work or school, however, during these breaks, many of us play sports, have jobs or preform other activities during this time off. It's important to keep in mind that many students preform various activities when discussing a summer assignment. Some schools offer up this assignments, that way students are able to learn during break. The question isn't whether summer assignments are necessary or not, because having prior knowledge going into a class is important, but rather the question is whether the summer assignments should be be comprised of questions made by teachers or questions made by students. Having questions created by students, will make the summer assignments much more useful.

If you ask any student who pays attention in a certain class about the way they feel about that class, they're sure to give you a wide array of emotions that they felt toward certain topics or units. For example, if you ask a student their thoughts on unit 7, they are able to tell you if it was hard or easy and if it was on the difficult side, they would be able to tell you what kind of questions confused them. having this foresight is very important when creating questions, you are able to give other students more exercises for the questions you think are more difficult.

Another reason why it is more beneficial for students to create summer assignments rather than teachers, is because teachers tend to over prepare students which could become damaging. ""Overprepare"" can mean that you know the bare minimum and more, which does apply to teachers summer assignments, however, knowing too much unnecessary information can make you forget important information. Overcrowding summer assignments with non vital knowledge can also be discouraging to students, and it will make them not want to attempt the work.

Overall, having student created questions will benefit other students taking that class, because, at the end of the day, students understand what it's like to be a student. A student is not just a person who attends a form a schooling but an actual person. Students need time for sports, jobs they may have, or even just socializing and hanging out with friends. Other people who understand these struggles, should be the ones who ultimatley be in control of the questions.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Driverless cars are coming and are closer than we think. Driverless cars are a phenomenal idea becauase they're innovative,all major car compaines are moving toward the driverless way and they're safe. This essay will disscuss these three reasons on why driverless cars are a phenomenal idea.

First driverless cars are overwhelmingly innovative. It states in the passage ""Originally,many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads"". This is putting into perspective that even futurists didn't believe it was possible but Google has achieved this monument to perfection. Also in the ariticle it says ""founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream"". As the original founder of this project he has even reached the level of innovation that he has been striving and working for since 2009.

Secondly alot of major car companies are striving for making their product driveless. For example in the passage it conveys ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time"". This is shownig how a major car company as innovative as Tesla is going to release a self driving car of their own. In that same paragraph it informs ""Mercendes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"". Showing that even some of the luxury brands and the major car compaines are releasing a driverless car. Showing how they agreee with where the future is going and how much of a phenomenal idea it is.

Lastly, the driverless cars are safe and take limitless precatious to stay safe. It describes in the article ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearveiw mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor"". This derscribes how many preperations is took for the car to be very safe.

In conclusion I have disscussed the three reasons why self-driving cars are a good idea. The reasons eing they're innovative, major car companies are doing it and they're safe. What do you think about the cars?   ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Driverless cars aren't a new topic to the automotive world. They weren't as advanced as they were now, but now they're much more advanced and more practical. Since we're in the modern era I can fully understand why people just want to hurry to make cars that drive themselves, but it just doesn't seem very practical. Driverless cars would have more faults than benefits to the road.

People just want to upgrade everything without seeing the faults in evolving. For example, the car still needs a driver to manage it, so why do you need to upgrade if it doesn't even fulfill its own namesake? The limited automotive use really just puts the driver at more risk, because of the possibility of a malfunction. On that note since the cars are lined with high tech equipment, and whatnot wouldn't the accident in that kind of vehicle be more severe? Something could explode, and injure much more than the drivers. This also would make one of these cars far more difficult to replace as it states in the article. With it being filled with sensors, and other high tech equipment this could lead to 100's of thousands of dollars being thrown out the window for repairs.

In the end the benefits of having a driverless car are outweighed by the faults.

The call is still pretty tough, since the idea is still underexplored as a whole. For all we know the problems could get worked, but manual cars won't become obsolete. Manual cars still retain the more benefits in my mind.   ",0,persuade_corpus,0

"In many parts of the world, cars are used on a daily basis. People use their cars everyday to get to work or any other place they go. These people should probably consider limiting their car usage. There are advantages to it and it can be beneficial.

The limiting of car usage can be helpful to them and their city's environment. I think that the people should limit their car usage because it can lower air pollution and air pollution is one of the biggest problems many cities or countries in the world are facing. This is because those citizens use their cars too much and they don't limit how much they use it.

On source 3 a businessman from Bogota, Columbia says that its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

In addition, citizens from every state and country should limit their car usage because they don't have to worry about traffic. These citizens should walk, take a bus or ride their bicycles to where they go.

It can also save them time and avoid the trafficjam in the streets and it might help them get to their destination faster. Source 3 says that

Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day leaving the streets of the capital city eerily devoided of traffic.

More over, citizens should limit using their cars because in some countries around the globe many people are cooperating and taking the advantage of limiting their car usage.

In some countries from Germany, there are families that do not own cars. On source 1 a media trainer and mother of two said that when she had a car she was always tense and now she's happy the way they are car free. In the city of Paris, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the global city . The usage of cars have created smog in different countries including Paris. In source 2 it says that motorists in Paris with even numbered plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine.

In conclusion, people from all the countries and cities of the world should take the advantage of limiting their car usage. It can benefit them by avoiding traffic if they ride their bicycles or walk, spending money on gasoline and get to where they need to go faster. Another advantage would be to avoid air pollution to the environment and city and help making it a better place by being a great and considering citizen and limit the amount of car usage.

"After reading the passage I came to the conclusion that some ways I think it's not valueble . FACS would be a smart tool for case workers or counslers . Some case workers deal with people who have emotion diseases such as post dramaic stress diseases in that nature . I feel like the creator could've made the tool for more serious reason, not that the emotion FACS was pointless but who would want to just find out their emotion and they can already feel it or going through it.

I feel like people would want to find out things more important like , whats going with that person , is the person feeling sick , is the person healthy . FACS could been about how's the day going to go , whats the weather going to be like . I feel like FACS is all hype in some way because it's basic , like yay we can see how we feel right?

They took all this time and objects figure how someones doing or feelings , instead of how we're living . Anyone can figure out someone's emotion expresses by their body language , their tone , how their speaking , when their speaking and etc. Often people may not want to speak on how they feel , alot of times teens want to keep their problems and emotions to them selves. Students are diffrent from adults, and also handle emotions diffrently.

FACS would be valueble if they come with conclusions to that person emotion at the time , plenty of ways technology can do things. If the FACS were a solution to a person with a bad day it would be valueble. Due to the fact their making this like it's a cool invention when FACS is exposing peoples feelings and then wat after that? I feel like the FACS should be upgraded and do more with it .

"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to organize my life in order to become a better person. In order to achieve this goal, I have created a plan that includes several important steps and strategies for completing them.

First and foremost, I need to prioritize my time and make sure that I am spending it in the most productive way possible. This means that I need to set aside time for school work, extracurricular activities, and personal development. I will use a planner to help me stay organized and on track, and I will make sure to schedule regular breaks to avoid burnout.

In addition to prioritizing my time, I also need to focus on developing healthy habits. This includes getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and exercising regularly. I will make sure to set realistic goals for myself and track my progress over time.

Another important aspect of becoming a better person is developing strong relationships with others. This means being a good listener, showing empathy, and being there for my friends and family when they need me. I will make an effort to be present and engaged in my interactions with others, and I will work on building trust and respect through my actions.

Finally, I need to make time for personal growth and self-improvement. This includes reading, learning new skills, and taking on new challenges. I will make an effort to step outside of my comfort zone and try new things, and I will seek out opportunities for personal growth and development.

In order to successfully implement this plan, I will need to be consistent and persistent in my efforts. This means setting achievable goals and working towards them every day, even when it is difficult or challenging. I will also seek out support and guidance from mentors, teachers, and peers when needed.

Overall, by prioritizing my time, developing healthy habits, building strong relationships with others, and focusing on personal growth and self-improvement, I am confident that I can become a better person. With dedication and hard work, I am excited to see the positive changes that this plan will bring to my life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Has any school ever forced you to do a sport or a school activity like student council or the year book. Because they have to me and I disagree with it. Because some people are just not meant for sports and other activities and it might be hard on some parents cause not every body has time and money.

The first thing most people come in to trouble with when trying to do a school activities or sports is the money and time not every body is a work from home or a stay at home parent/guardian some people even work from 6am to 9pm and cant pick up there kids. The next problem is not every one has money to afford sports and they can get really expensive depending on which sport that you want to play.

Another problem is some kids do not like to be social and have anxiety which can help them but it might also really mess with them. Certain students that don't always like to talk which is something you always need for team work and extracurricular activities like student counseling. The fourth problem is that some people are not always in the best shape to play a sport and people might make fun of them for when they play or do anything. The final thing is some people have medical problems like asthma where they can not run for long periods of time which you need in a sport.

In the end i really disagree that everybody should have to do sports or certain activities because not every one has time, money, and sometimes the right mental health or just dont like to communicate with people which is something that everyone needs for teamwork.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Attending a four-year high school has significant benefits that cannot be overlooked. While some students may argue that attending a three-year high school is just as beneficial, there are several reasons why a four-year high school is the better option.

Firstly, attending a four-year high school allows students to take more advanced courses. Three-year high schools may not offer the same level of advanced courses as four-year high schools. This means that students may not be able to take courses that are necessary for their future careers. For example, many colleges require students to take advanced math and science courses in high school, and three-year high schools may not offer these courses.

Secondly, attending a four-year high school allows students to participate in more extracurricular activities. Many four-year high schools offer a wider range of extracurricular activities than three-year high schools. This means that students can participate in activities that they are passionate about, such as sports, music, or clubs. These activities can also help students develop important skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and communication.

Thirdly, attending a four-year high school can help students prepare for college. Many colleges require students to take standardized tests, such as the SAT or ACT, in order to be considered for admission. Four-year high schools typically offer more resources and support to help students prepare for these tests. This means that students who attend a four-year high school may have a better chance of getting into their desired college.

Finally, attending a four-year high school can provide students with a more structured and supportive environment. Four-year high schools typically have larger student bodies than three-year high schools, which means that students can meet more people and make more friends. Additionally, four-year high schools often have more resources, such as counselors and tutors, to help students with their academic and personal needs.

In conclusion, attending a four-year high school has significant benefits that cannot be overlooked. From advanced courses to extracurricular activities, college preparation, and a supportive environment, a four-year high school can provide students with the tools they need to succeed in the future. While some may argue that attending a three-year high school is just as beneficial, the evidence suggests that a four-year high school is the better option.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"The long list of benefits that comes from limited car usage are mostly based on where you live and how much you do your part. Laws and restrictions have been arriving across the entire world to see the effects of having little or no automobiles in the community. Other countries that have an intense cloud of smog need to ban car use in the millions at a time to help settle down the atmosphere there.

Life without cars today can be very well described in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars . In her article she describes how the community is shaped and condensed in order to make travelling to necessarry places easy through walking or bike riding distance. This is the kind of turn around that the world needs as well. With the amount of pollution happening, this is a good experiment that will hopefully spread all over the planet.

The amount of pollution affecting certain cities across the world is getting rather out of hand. In Robert Duffer's article

Paris bans driving due to smog , he talks about the intense pollution over France's capital, resulting in the partial ban of almost

HALF

of the amount of cars on the road at once. Those who violated the ban's rules were fined, and thousands of cars were impounded as well due the the reaction of citizens when they received the fine. In paragraph 14 of the article, Duffer states that ""

Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France ,

after five days of intensifying smog.""

The ban clearly worked, showing that it was indeed the heavy number of vehicles on the road all at once.

Programs all across the world have gotten people in the millions to find other methods of travel that did not cause any pollution. Columbia is a huge example as shown in Andrew Selsky's article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota . In the article, Selsky specifies about how millions of Columbians have taken alternative modes of transport, whether it be hiking, biking, or skating as opposed to general driving. Even on account of rain, the citizens found ways to get about without using their cars. This is making Bogota a more human and social place as well, as Selsky states, ""

Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.""

This event is happening for the good of the people and of the planet, and it seems like everyone is okay with that.

With the way our world is rapidly changing with a new generation and new technology, we are going to have to adapt from our old habits. Young adults are not seeing the full necessity of buying a vehicle when they can get to where they need to go by other means that are less expensive and less harmful to the environment. The need for everyone to have a car is slowly going down. It may never completely go away, but it is reducing greatly.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is an article that is written by someone who has perspectives on what is good about driverless cars, and what is bad about the cars. After reading this article I believe that the driverless cars are going to be very helpful, and useful to people in the future. I believe that driverless cars will be helpful because the driver will not have to do much work, because the car drives itself 90% of the time. Also in this article the author tell us that the Google driverless cars, can drive up to half a million miles before the car crashes. Driverless cars will also be helpful because the people that were originally driving, do not have to memorize directions anymore.

Being a driver requires a lot of attention to the road, and it is hard to pay attention to everything else that is going on around them. With the new driverless car, you do not have to drive the car 90% of the time, which allows for more time to think about other things or make sure that your kids are behaving in the back seats, without having to pay attention to the road. Although 10% of the time you may have to drive, the other 90% you are worry free of driving and can focus on other things that you need to.

When people are driving themselves, they tend to be in car accidents very often whether it is severe or not. With the driverless car, you can prevent accidents from happening for a much longer time. Driverless cars have gone up to half a million miles before ever being in a single accident. Going half a million miles without an accident, or the car breaking down is unheard of and nearly impossible, but with the driverless cars, the technology is so outstanding, that the car can go this far.

Using a GPS while in a car can be distracting and not safe to the driver, and everyone else that is in the car. Since the driverless car drives for people, now the people in the car can set the GPS and not be distracted by the road. With this feature, the car will always know when the right time to turn is, and will always get you to your destination on time. If you are a person who is late a lot or gets lost all the time, then you might be interested in this car, because it does all of the work for you.

Driverless cars are a great idea because they drive 90% of the time, which leaves the driver to be focused on other things, it can drive up to half a million miles before crashing or breaking down, which will make the car owner feel very safe and secure in the car that they own, and also the car takes you where you tell it to because of the GPS system, which can make the owner worry free about getting lost. I believe that this car will be very successful, and it will be the future in the car industry.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"While I was growing up, my father taught me many things that would help me in the future. Some of the teachings are warnings that would distract me and would not find my way back to the way I was before. This is caused by drugs, pornography, murder, stealing, and etc. But the point is, one of the teachings was to put my priorities straight. He said if you do not put your priorities straight then you will have an unsuccessful future. That has been one of my goals, and that is to be sure I have a plan to know what I will be doing in the future.

One of my priorities is school. While I was growing up, I was taught to work hard for school so that I may have a successful career. I was taught to be sure to have straight A' s and not get into trouble. I was very fond of school and addicted to school until I had learned of a new hobby that I desired. That was sports. I have learned over the years that sports are distracting. The school year was combined with football. I started to nudge football as my number one priority. Therefore, my grades dropped and I was miserable. I tried everything to get back on track but my coach was always there to make sure that my athletic ability would never be lost because he needed me on the team I played for.

My parents were worried about sports how it intervened with school. So they began to make sure I would put extra hard work for school. I did everything to get back on track. Ever since I was in junior high, I have never earned a four point 0 in my GPA because of sports. But now I am losing the desire of sports because of my focus on education. I am earning better grades than I did before and I believe that this hard work will help me to receive a triumphant career.

My point is that sport players should set their priorities straight. Education should come before sports. Some people believe that if you are athletic enough to go to professional. Yes, but what if an injury occurs that could affect you whole career. Now what do you do. If your priority was a sport than education and you are not able to go back to sport then you must return back to school. You will regret it over the future. I have a brother who went to Kansas to do sales. He earned large sums of money because of his success. My father did not see this as a smart idea. He made sure that my brother would realize that his education in college was still important. He did not want my brother to rely on making money by doing sales. My father said that if troubled times come and are unemployed then you will regret the day you turned away from your education.

Yes, I do believe that you must have a B-average to play a sport. Set your priorities straight and take precaution of your education. Education is very helpful these days in America. America's economy is failing and unemployment is sky rocketing. The only thing you can turn to is your education. You need money to support your family or see your family fall apart. Do not take pride in your sport or you may regret it in the future.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The author suggest that studying venus is a worthy pursuit because, venuse have been the most like earth planet in our solar system. they belive that long ago venus was probably coverd with large oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.""venus can sometimes be a nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"". NASA has been thinking of many ideas to help humans explore venus, possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray of venus. bump like vehical hovering over 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. like a jet airplane travel at ahigher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the deadly ground conditions by staying up and out of the their way. researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus.

NASA have come up with example of tool that can help build a safe ship for human to travel to venus. some simplified electronics made of silicon carbibe have been testred in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in venus conditions. mecchanical computers which is an old technology might help people explore venus. peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited on ground. most light cannot penetrate the dense atomoshpere, rendering standard forms of photograhy and videography ineffective.

Even though venus is the close to earth twin there are still many dangers to exploring the planet. the atmospere contains 97 percent carboin dioxide. the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. on venus surface tempertures aveage over 800 degrees fahrenheit. the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what humans experiance on our own planet.

The condition on venus are far more extreme then anything humans can encounter on earth. the enviorment would crush even a submarine diving to the deepest parts of our oceans. venus has the hottest surface temperture than any planet. high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eurupting volcanoes. powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value. because human curiosty will likely lead us into many equally intimidating enveavors. travelers on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger to explore venus more. venus should be expanded to help meet the edges of imagination and inovation.

"The idea that summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Should be student-designed cause for the whole school year teachers have assigned papers and projects that they think is a good idea which some of them are, but some of them are confusing and hard to some students.

As a student I feel as if we should come up with our own project, especially that some students want to be teachers one day get a head start on how to come up with a project for their students for the future. For example students may use their teachers project that they assigned them and put a twist on it something that is fun to work on,but teachers and some students think that it should be teacher-designed cause some students have a mindset and think teachers have been giving out projects all year why stop now. Which is a lazy mindset students should want to make their own project. One student might just go as far and say why can't it be both and the teachers and the students come up with a project and combine it which is great but as students get told to do these assignments and projects from their teacher and they are specific projects with a rubric there isnt much a student can do but go by what they are told from the rubric, no brainstorm ideas just get an A and go by the rubric. It should be student-designed cause students have their own ideas and what they can do to make a project better and look appealing you get a project from a teacher and a rubric and you are going off not what you think but the rubric what the teacher wants so every student is doing that, thats why all projects look the same and have the same idea and concept. Teachers argue that it should be teacher-designed because the students are going to do something thats not important like video games or sports not about academics and that is a valid argument, however how do they know what the students are going to do that if they don't get to make their own project. Teachers may say because it is the summer students won't do the project cause there have been assignments where they are given over the weekend and the students still won't do them so if they give the students a project over the summer they will defiantly not get it done which is false that project will be 60% of your grade for the new school year who doesn't want to start out with a perfect grade at the beginning of the year? some students will forget over the summer yes but when the school year is about to begin send an email to a parent or on the remind app so when the students do come back they are ready to present. I would like to see what students come up with and how they would present it students should be able to do summer projects with their rubric that they came up with and doing these student-designed projects will help them with a career and a job where they need to brainstorm and think of their own ideas instead of getting the exact directions handed to them. It also takes the stress off the teacher in thinking of a summer project, before the end of the year a student-designed project would be good and would benefit the students greatly.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The ""Face on Mars"" may seem like is was created by aliens but it is just a coincidence that the landform looks just like a face. The ""Face on Mars"" is in fact just a mesa but with ""unusual shadows that made it look like an Egytian Pharaoh"". In my opinion,it may seem like a alien has created the face on Mars but I belive that such a thing as alien do not exist.

The picture of the face being in 1976 did not have good quality with the high technology we have today. So when Michael Malin and his MOS team took a photo of the face recently people were shocked to find out that the face is just a natural landform. Also, not many scientist belive that the face is a alien artifact either.

"Schools that offer distance learning is a open option for student's. Can it be beneficial for student's to attend school classes at home as well as video chatting for conferences? My opinion on this statement is distance learning is not beneficial, Certain kids take advantage of online schooling to not attend school and to stay at home. Most few kids can't learn their material through computer and prefer being in a classroom and being taught verbally. Everyone's learning skills are different.

Online classes are like books on a computer and having to learn all your materials on your own. Attending school will help you learn more things about all your subjects. When having trouble with any subject you will have teachers and other students to go to when needed help.

Distance learning may effect your social life. Socializing with other student's at school is a great way to make friends. Going to school and having a routine every morning will help you to be independent and having you'r own responsibilities, it will prepare you as you get older. Although waking up in the morning can be harsh and very tiring, you must think about the future you want to have.

School is where you have opportunity's for many things. Doing online classes won't be like going to school where they give you opportunity's to go on field trips and have fun at the dances or participating in sports and clubs. If attending school you can make childhood memories to tell and the long run.

Distance learning is not beneficial you lose a lot of opportunity's and enjoyments. I have to strongly disagree with doing online classes at home. Going to school is where you find yourself and start to plan the future that you want to accomplish.                       ",0,persuade_corpus,4

I don't think the principal should make the students clean up litter or do community service because they might have other thinks to do with their family's. Elementary students can probably do it because they might not have anything to do because they still in elementary and they probably have time to pick up litter or maybe jr high students can help too if there not to busy maybe some of the students that don't play any sports can probably help too. In some schools the principals are probably gonna require all the students to do community services because how they probably act or maybe she or he gonna make they bad people do community service.

"Students do not always agree with teachers when it comes to projects. Some schools assign summer projects. These can either be designed by the teachers or the students. There are those who argue that teachers should be the ones to design the projects. Although some may disagree, it is easier to just allow the students to design the projects themselves.

Student made projects can be very beneficial to teachers. First off, teachers will be able to learn more about their students. If the project is something more personal it could reveal something the teacher did not know about the student. For example, doing a project on an inspirational person will give the teacher a better idea of the student's interests. Secondly, teachers will not always have the best ideas for projects. The result of this could be a project that is easy to grade but a hassle for the student making it. Imagine having to write a monologue, it is very easy to critic; however, it is both a difficult assignment to script, as well as present. Finally, an assignment another student created could inspire a future student to try new things and give them fresh ideas for their projects. Assignments such as these are often kept by teachers, if they are good enough to present to future students as an example of what they could do. An example showing a project through a flashy presentation program like Prezi could draw a student's attention away from a boring poster.

If students were allowed to design their own projects, they would have greater freedom when developing ideas for their projects.

For starters, students will be much more motivated to work on a topic that interests them. Someone who likes action and crime would not be drawn to a project on a book like

Pride and Prejudice.

Also, students will get to experiment with new methods of presentation for their projects. Someone who invested a great amount of time and effort into their project will not want to present their work in a dull manner. A poster will not do justice to a project someone invested a lot of their time into; however, the student could try new PowerPoints or even make a video with fellow students in order to up the presentation. Finally, projects produced by students will be of both higher quality and variety than a uniform teacher's project. If the students are willing to put time in and really work hard on their projects then no two projects will be the same. These projects will all have different: methods of presentation, key points, evidence for claims, and the main idea will vary as a whole as well making the possibilities as great as the imagination of the students.

Although some may disagree, it is easier to just allow students to design the projects themselves. This method will benefit both the students and the teachers. Teachers will learn more about their students and will not have to design the projects. Students will be more free to use the methods they wish when making the project and will have the option to do the project on a topic they feel is worth expressing themselves for. Even future students will benefit if the teachers choose to keep the projects as examples. There are those who argue that teachers should design projects; however, it is better to just leave it to the students. No student wants to work on, let alone present a project which they have no interest in, so they should be free to guide themselves in whatever way they see fit.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Graduating high school early has become increasingly popular among students in recent years. While there are many advantages to this approach, there are also some potential drawbacks that students should be aware of. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the issue and argue that graduating early is ultimately the best option for most students.

One of the main advantages of graduating early is the extra time it provides for students to explore different career paths. By completing their high school education a year earlier, students have more time to research and apply to colleges and universities, as well as to gain work experience in their desired field. This extra time can also allow students to take courses that are not available to them in their regular high school curriculum, such as advanced placement or honors courses.

Additionally, graduating early can help students manage their workloads and reduce stress. High school can be a challenging time for many students, with a heavy course load and extracurricular activities. By completing their high school education a year earlier, students can take a break and focus on other areas of their lives, such as personal hobbies or travel. This can help reduce the stress and anxiety that often come with high school, and allow students to enter college or the workforce with a clearer sense of direction.

However, there are also some potential disadvantages to graduating early. One of the main risks is the added stress and workload that comes with taking extra classes. Graduating early often requires students to take additional courses or take more challenging courses in order to complete their high school education in a shorter amount of time. This can be a significant challenge for some students, and may lead to burnout or academic difficulties.

Another potential drawback of graduating early is the lack of socialization opportunities. High school is a time when students are able to form close friendships and develop important social skills. By graduating early, students may miss out on these opportunities and struggle to make connections with their peers. This can be a significant disadvantage for students who value social interaction and relationships.

In conclusion, graduating high school early has both advantages and disadvantages. While it provides students with extra time to explore different career paths and manage their workloads, it also comes with added stress and workload, as well as the potential for social isolation. Ultimately, the decision to graduate early should be based on the individual needs",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Now trust me I know projects are not exciting and having them in the summer sounds terrible, but what if I told you having summer projects could be fun. If you got to pick who designed your summer projects who would you pick: teacher-designed or student-designed? Having student-designed projects is so unique and a great way to make projects more interesting. How about we switch it up a bit and instead of teachers creating the projects students do. Making summer projects student-designed would make it stress free on students, give them freedom, and it would make learning fun.

I'm currently a high school student, so trust me I know how stressful school projects can be. If students designed these summer projects all the stress would go away. You would get to do the project on your own time and you'd get to pick what you want to learn about. Students wouldn't make the projects super hard or long because it is summer break and that's their time to relax. A teacher would normally give you a rubric or a set of guidelines you have to follow, but now you get to make it how you want.

The possibilities are so endless if students got to build summer projects. You'd be able to pick how you want to do things and you could really bring out your creative side. It's the students break, this is when they don't want to think about school, so they should be able to decide whats best for them. You wouldn't have a list of things you need to follow you would be able to do whatever you wanted to. This would be such a great opportunity for students to enjoy learning and make it interesting.

I know I've definitely gotten a topic to research about and it wasn't interesting to me at all. Having to do a project on something you find boring won't give you the motivation you'd need to push through it. If students got to pick what they wanted to learn, they wouldn't mind having these projects during summer break. Finding something to learn about that really interests you would make the experience as a whole ten times better. Maybe you're doing a poster on something you learned about in history, you get to enjoy learning about it and make that poster however you want to.

Student-designed summer projects overall sound like something that would satisfy every student. Having teacher-designed projects would most likely be more organized and efficient, but students would have more fun and enjoy learning if it was student designed. Lets make learning over summer break something everyone would enjoy while also being able to relax. In conclusion, letting students create their own summer projects would give them the break they deserve, but to also assure they are still learning. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Generic_Name declared all his students must participate in one or more extracurricular activities. It's not a choice for his students to not participate. What the school's students do have a choice over is which activity they want to participate in. People will agree or disagree with his decision, but it will expose students to new views or angles of what they want to do or enjoy. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because it benefits their social, mental and physical health.

Exposing students to exciting and beneficial activities can open up a new passion! Instead of lazing over homework or moping around their house, children can be brighter and happier to get things done. When students are in an environment they enjoy, it can motivate them and brighten up their day. No one likes sitting in a classroom for seven hours. If students have something exciting to look forward to at the end of the day or the day after, it will push them to get their work done to participate in what they want to do.

In addition, extracurriculars give students a reason not to stay home and isolate themselves. A bunch of children just want to go home and binge shows or movies if they'v got nothing to go to. Especially, when they are bored. School can cause stress, so they'll want to wind down by getting sucked into their electronics. Instead, finding something as relaxing as watching a movie, like drawing, making music, reading, etc. is better for their eyes and won't cause eye induced headaches. But, the only way for them to realize that's what they like, is to expose them to it.

Also, if a student were to choose an outdoor activity it would include benefiting their mental health. Fresh air and natural light is good for everyone and wakes people up. Generally, unnatural light causes headaches, tiredness, and is known for making people lose concentration. Being indoors also can cause a trapped or caged feeling because it would be hard to get up and move without disrupting a working environment. Indoor lighting tends to feel dull and drab, not bright and happy.

When students have a closer similarity (their extracurricular activity) it can give them something in common. Having something in common helps people socialize and discuss that topic. Then, children can make friends over things they both like to do and discuss, plus they'll be able to work together on the topic. If the topic they made friends over was a sport, they can become better friends because teammates have to rely on each other during games. Having a sport as an extracurricular activity also gets kids exercising and it's not always a bad thing.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities are good for students. They allow children to maintain their physical health and grow their social circle. Extracurriculars can also benefit their mental health and get kids excited to get done with the day at school. It also gets them out of the house, but still getting to relax or have fun! ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Would you like to go on a trip to Europe. Then when you graduate go to seagoing cowboy maybe next time he goes he will bring you with him .

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Accomplishment in the workplace is like, super important, you know? It's like, how successful you are in your job and how much you get done. And there are like, a bunch of factors that can affect it.

First, there's motivation. If you're not motivated to do your job, you're not gonna get much done. Like, if you don't care about your job, you're not gonna work hard and you're not gonna be very successful. But if you're motivated, you'll be like, super focused and you'll get a lot done.

Another factor is, like, your skills and knowledge. If you're good at your job and you know how to do it, you'll be able to accomplish more. Like, if you're a graphic designer and you know how to use Photoshop, you can make really cool designs and stuff. But if you don't know how to use it, you won't be able to make anything good.

And then there's, like, the people you work with. If you work with people who are supportive and helpful, you'll be more likely to be successful. Like, if you work with people who are nice and who will help you when you need it, you'll be able to get more done. But if you work with people who are mean and who don't want you to succeed, it'll be harder for you to accomplish things.

But, like, my conclusion is that the most important factor is motivation. If you're motivated, you'll be able to do stuff and be successful. And if you're not motivated, you won't be able to do stuff and you won't be successful. So, like, it's really important to be motivated if you want to be successful in the workplace.

I hope that makes sense! Let me know if you have any questions or need me to clarify anything.",1,llama2_chat,3
"In all four sources they have advantages of limiting car usage.

For example in Source 3 ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky it says ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving he streets of this captial city eerily devoid of traffic jams. This example shows how they limit car usage in Colombia.

Another example would be ""When I had a car I was always tense."" Im much happier this way"" said Heidrum Walter."" as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" This quote from the article shows how walking turned out pretty good for her instead of driving all the time.(Source 1)

In source 4 Elisabeth states that ""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorites, as do a profliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation."" This example shows how a program for bike sharing worked out great instead of using your cars.

"One reason people seek different opinions is because some people have different opinions on what people should do. Seeking different people's opinions allows you to get all the information from all sides. If people seek more than one person's advice then you would be able to compare the information to see what you think is the best choice. Also, if people seek more than one person's advice then the person might be able to collect all the information and put it together.

Another reason people ask different people is because the first person may not be giving you the best advice. Like, what if the first person's advice is pretty good, but then the next person you ask has better advice. If the person asked advice from more than one person then you wouldn't have to be stuck with the bad information. If you just ask for one person's advice and it was bad advice then it could get you in really big trouble. Like, if you rely on one person's advice and they told you that if they start making you mad then you can put your hands on them. What if the person you put hands on presses charges then you could go to jail for a long time. If you asked another person's opinion then you may not be in the situation that you are in.

The next reason why people ask different people for adivce is because if the advice the person gave you worked for them, but it didn't work for you. Like, if a person is having trouble with their dog alerting them that they need to use the restroom. So that their dog doesn't keep going to the restroom in the house. They might say ""you could give your dog a treat when they alert you they need to go to the restroom"". If that doesn't work, but you only asked one person for advice. Then, you would be mad because the advice didn't work. Next, you would have to ask another person for advice, but at the beginning if you would have just asked more than one person then you would be able to peice the information together.

Finally, if people ask more than one person's advice then it will help you make the best choice possible.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear principal

I think that would be a good idea but at the same time it would be a bad one. The reason why i think it would be a good idea is because if people wanted to do sports and they had a C or lower, they would work on getting their grade up and they would learn more things if they payed more attention and they got their work in. I think it would help the students too because if they just kept failing every class they wouldn't have as good education as if they did pay attention and they would have a better life because it would help them in life. Another thing why i think it's a good idea is because people would get used to getting as B or higher and they would probably keep it that way.

Why i think it would be a bad idea is because what if people really liked the sport but they couldn't play in it because their grade was around a C and it was hard to get it up and then people couldn't join the team so they didn't get to play. There wouldn't be very much people on the team as if it was a C or higher. Another reason why i think it is a bad idea is because students wouldn't want to join a sport anymore if it was a B or higher and the students would start getting lazy and their wouldn't be as much athletic people as before. I think more people would rather just have it as a C instead because they would be able to get the C instead of the B because it would be harder for them to get the B and keep it that way.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The author was talking about all off the crazy thing that venus has in common with planet earth, but it would be highly dangerous to go. When the author talks about all of the bad conditions that venus has its makes you really think how hard it would be to get to the hot lava planet. What the author is trying to get you to see is that venus has a lot of dangerous conditions, but that the scientists know how hard that would be.

The author starts off with putting details of venus in our head by saying things like, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" and ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"". By this the author is trying to tell you how hard it would be for man-kind to be in physical contact with venus. The author is putting physical details in our head about this planet.

After the author starts talking about that he states the question ""why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface""? The author ask this to us thinking about whats the point if there is nothing speaical its just a hot rock. Wrong, the author states how venus was just like earth it had it valleys it had its water it had everything earth has. It would be very good to know that if anything happen to earth we always have a back up planet to go to.

The last thing that the author was trying to do was talk about how The National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. When I read that it kinda got me excitied i was thinking we might get to see mars wow thats cool. The author states that ""imagines a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the Venusian landscape"".

In conclusion what the author is trying to get the reader to do would be make all of the reader think about how cool it would be to be able to go to a ""earth like planet"". How he uses the details and the things they learned from NASA kinda gets you exicited about what will come in the future. So the author was giving us all of these reasoning about how dangerous it would be but it woukd be very good to know.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"In today's world, technology has become an integral part of our lives, and it has also impacted the way we interact with each other. One such program that has gained popularity in recent years is Discord, a communication platform that allows users to create channels for various purposes, including gaming, school, and personal use. While Discord has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks, and its effects on student relationships, teamwork, and trust can be both positive and negative.

On one hand, Discord has allowed students to connect with each other outside of the classroom, which can lead to the formation of stronger relationships. For example, students can create channels for their school clubs or teams, where they can communicate and collaborate on projects together. This can help to build trust and foster a sense of camaraderie among students. Additionally, Discord has become a popular platform for gamers, and the ability to connect with other gamers from around the world can lead to the formation of new friendships.

However, Discord can also have negative effects on student relationships, teamwork, and trust. For example, some students may use the platform to bully or harass others, which can lead to a breakdown in trust and relationships. Additionally, Discord can be a distraction from schoolwork, and students may spend too much time on the platform, leading to a lack of focus and productivity. This can also lead to a breakdown in trust, as students may not take each other seriously if they are not meeting their responsibilities.

In conclusion, while Discord has its benefits, it can also have negative effects on student relationships, teamwork, and trust. It is important for students to use the platform responsibly and to be mindful of the impact their actions may have on others. By doing so, they can build stronger relationships and work together more effectively.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"I was stuck in between two decisions, live with my mom or live with my dad. I could ask for help, but would it make a difference if I didn't feel happy about it? Asking friends could lead to fights, and if I asked parents and step parents they would probably make it some emotional lesson. I decided to ask my uncle, Generic_Name, who could relate to me on many occasions. He said that it was up to me but he thought I would be happier at my dads house. It wasn't enough only being one person, so I went to my aunt, Generic_Name, who said my mom needed me more. I needed tie breaker. My last resort was my brother, Generic_Name. Although he was not close to me at all, he was honest with me and said that I should stay with my dad. He said that if I wanted to be mentally stable and not have my clothes carry the stench of smoke form cigarettes, dad was the right option.

They weren't all the same option but it was easier than me and one other person deciding. Because I got more than one persons opinion, I went down the right path.

I think asking advice from more than one person and seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Making a decision by yourself or with only one other person's opinion, can be damaging to the mind. If you are trying to make a decision and make a right choice, you are most likely always thinking about it. It always being on your mind leads to distress and you just made a one track mind. Your mind is not meant to only think of one subject, it needs to constantly be running with new ideas and thoughts. Your creativity relies on parts of your brain. You will, literally, go brain dead. School takes on a lot of thinking, but we have multiple subjects. Having multiple subjects means that your mind is switching between them and not on just one. You are supposed to challenge your brain, and you are supposed to let it win, not defeat it.

Another reason you should get more than one persons opinion is that the one person you choose could be manipulating you. If you ask for their opinion and they can see physically that your stressed, they will take advantage of that. They will take advantage of you by choosing the decision they want and not think of you. They have the high ground over you and you are willing to stay down.

It will benefit them, but have no effect, positive or negative, on you. It does not matter if your the one who brought it up, they are the stronger one because you are controlling your own mind into thinking that's okay. You can't fool your bodies actions but you can fool your mind into what ever you want it to be.

The last reason you should get more people's opinions is that you have someone to talk to. When you are in the decision making mindset, you are not aware of your surroundings. You are being held down by the stress that is being a burden to you. Your brain is feeling heavy and you are feeling wary. When you sit down with someone, you can set the burden down. You now are in the mindset of getting help from people. They will share their opinions, and then you move on to another. You don't even have to know that person, and the problem does't even have to be that big. Listening to their own opinions can help your own. Visually, physically, listening, you can find anyone's opinion.

Those are some of my reasons why getting opinions from other people can help someone make a better choice. People think that using your brain for a one act thing is okay. It's damaging to your thoughts and to your creativity. Once you get into the one set mind, it's very difficult to get out of it. People manipulating you is also not okay. You have the question, you ask it, you control it. Don't let anyone else control it. And lastly, talking to someone is essential to make the best decision. Why have all that stress on your back while you can just take it off. You have control over your brain, so don't ruin it.               ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Honesty is like a superpower. It's something that can make or break relationships, shape our personalities, and define who we are as individuals. As an 8th grader, I've learned that honesty is not only the right thing to do, but it's also essential for a happy and fulfilling life.

First of all, honesty is important to me because it helps me be true to myself. When I'm honest with myself, I can't hide behind lies or excuses. I have to face the truth, no matter how hard it is. This helps me grow and learn from my mistakes. For example, if I did something wrong, I have to admit it and take responsibility for my actions. It's not easy, but it's better to face the truth than to try to cover it up.

Honesty is also important in my relationships with my family. When I'm honest with them, they know they can trust me. They know that I'll always tell them the truth, no matter what. This builds a strong bond between us, and we can rely on each other. For instance, if I'm struggling in school, I can tell my parents the truth, and they'll help me find a solution. They won't get mad at me or judge me, they'll just help me.

But honesty isn't just important in personal relationships, it's also important in our interactions with others. When we're honest with others, we show them that we respect them and value their feelings. For example, if someone asks me how they look in a new outfit, I'll tell them the truth, even if it's not what they want to hear. I'll say something like, ""Honestly, I think the blue shirt looks better on you."" It might be hard to hear, but at least they know the truth.

Finally, honesty is important because it helps us build trust. When we're honest, we show others that we're reliable and dependable. They know that they can count on us to be truthful, and this builds trust. For instance, if I'm working on a project with a group of friends, I'll be honest about my contributions. I'll say something like, ""I worked on this",1,llama2_chat,3
"The Electoral College has its pros and cons. Either keeping the Electoral College or changing it to election by popular vote for the presidents of the U.S. will have its disadvantages and advantages of course. So, why keep it if the people don't actually pick the president?

One of the reasons why the Electoral College should be changed is because its not Democratic. The voters don't vote for the president, they actually vote for a slate of electors who are the ones who elect the president. ""Because of the winner-take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states"" - by Bradford Plumer. Its not fair that some states won't even have a saying in choosing the president. Everyone should have a saying even if the candidates in the winner-take all system don't want to spend their time. We live in a democratic country we should be allowed to choose the persident instead of the Electoral College. Its unfair and irrational that the electors choose the president instead of the people.

The Electoral College does help the elections avoid Run-Off Elections. Larger states will always get more attention in a campaign than a small state. This is because larger states have a bigger population than small states.""The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"". -by Richard A. Posner. Just because not everyone pays close attention to the competing campaign. It doesn't been they shouldn't be treated differently than the ones who do. Everyone should be treated equally no matter what there opinion or choice is.

My opinion about if we should keep or change the Electoral College is biased. I don't think we should keep or even change it for the president to be elected by a populr vote. The electoral college helps weight the political balance in large states. It also doesn't allow the people to vote for the president. Either way i would be fine with whatever decision happens to the electoral college. I can't chose a way to argue about it cause i go both ways with my arguements.

In overal the Electoral College has its advantages and disadvantages. It all depends in everyones point of view. People should be treated equally about the decision they made. Let the people be able to choose the president of the United States its a right they have don't take it away from them because it wouldn't be fair to them. We live in a democratic country and the people have the power.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4

He let his student calculating like math about facial movements human used to express their feeling. This is the 3D computer's face 44 major mucles in this model . Mr Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of Facial Action Coding

System. He has six emotional like happiness, suprise, anger, disguist, fear,and sadness. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal "" He said with the unsimiling face. ""even though inviduals often show varing degees of expression"". An start the new sofeware to show them how Mona Lisa smile . Dr. Huang used da Vinci sofeware to show the muscle on her smile. The Mona Lisa demonstration to bring smile in her face This computer can know is you happy or sad. If they play video game you fell happy so thee computer know that too. If they try their comuter at home maybe it can't because this is the special computer with new sofeware. In my opion show the emotion is very important bacuse it will show the tacher if you understand the lesson or not. If you show the teacher with the exicting face you show the teacher that you don't understandnd but you show he teacher a couple smile you can make sure that you understand the lesson.

But at nigh or when they come back home hey will feel sad they cried all day all night. They will be a not social or can't focus on study so if we use that technology it will let the teacher know the feeling of each student. If they have any problem the teacher can help them figure out or help them overcome that feelunng and bring student the possituve feeling. Some of student is they feel very bored or very sad they will have some disease happen about the neron in their hed make them crazy and bring that sad whole life.

The student look at the mirror and try to smile so they can see the changing of the smile. Because when to stand in front of the mirror an smile that show every part of that smile so you can see that. However,, simile is come from our emotion if we feel happy or comfortable your smile will come very natural. If you not happy it will show you the smile lip without happy eyebrow . The student feel very excited about this part. The feeling of each of person are very important . Nowaday, it's kind of hard to find that technology so i hope that the scientist can make one for the teacher. You should open and share your feeling to the other person so they can understand or they can undeersttand you well. If it's hard to share with friends or teacher you can shared with your parent . They have more year to face with a lot of problem more than you maybe thay will have some good solution that can help you fix the problem. Finally, the scientist should produce that machine for the teacher to undersand the student or they can share with the teacher or family beacause our feeling is very important , it will make people make good thing and focus more on work.

"A positive attitude is a crucial aspect of life. It can lead to numerous benefits, including improved mental and physical health, better relationships, and increased success in various areas of life. In this essay, we will explore the advantages of having a positive attitude, examine examples of how it can lead to employment and recognition, analyze the potential consequences of a negative attitude, compare the two attitudes, and draw a conclusion on their importance.

Firstly, having a positive attitude can have a significant impact on mental and physical health. Research has shown that people with a positive outlook tend to have lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. They also have a stronger immune system, which can help them fight off illnesses and diseases. Furthermore, a positive attitude can lead to better sleep, improved memory, and increased motivation to achieve goals.

Secondly, having a positive attitude can lead to employment and recognition. Studies have shown that people with a positive attitude are more likely to be hired and promoted in the workplace. They are also more likely to be noticed by important people, such as teachers, coaches, and mentors. This is because they tend to be more confident, enthusiastic, and team-oriented, which are all valuable qualities in any work environment.

However, having a negative attitude can have severe consequences. It can lead to feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and helplessness, which can have a significant impact on mental and physical health. It can also lead to social isolation, as people with a negative attitude tend to push others away and avoid social interaction. Furthermore, a negative attitude can lead to poor decision-making, which can result in missed opportunities and failures.

When comparing the two attitudes, it is clear that a positive attitude allows for more successful outcomes. People with a positive attitude tend to have better mental and physical health, better relationships, and increased success in various areas of life. On the other hand, people with a negative attitude tend to have poorer mental and physical health, social isolation, and poor decision-making.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is crucial for success in life. It can lead to numerous benefits, including improved mental and physical health, better relationships, and increased success in various areas of life. It is important to recognize the potential consequences of a negative attitude and make a conscious effort to cultivate a positive outlook. By doing so, we can improve our overall quality of life and achieve",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"The following essay is an analaysis of the artice ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" and an evaluation of the points that the article brings up. The article describes dangers of visting our neighbour planet venus and ideas of how it could be done.

The author does a great job to describe venus as the Earth's ""twin"", but also as a dangerous planet that is not made for us. He brings up that no spacecraft has survived a landing for more than a few hours, that the atmosphere is 97% carbon doixide, that there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, that the plantes surface has an average temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater as it is on the Earth. All these points convinced me that Venus is a planet that is not made for us to be on. Even if he brings up points why we should still go there it seems to me like it would make no common sense. He says that Venus once looked just like the Earth, but for me it doesn't matter how it once looked like because then we would first go into time traveling and that is not what this article is about. The author also brings up that there could be a survivable soulution by having a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the landscapre. I don't think that this is a good idea, because it would take so much work and money just to see things that we can see without a human being there. He mentions that it probably wouldn't even help the scientists that much because we wouldn't be able to take samples of anything or even inspect the ground conditions. So I think that idea is a waste of money and unless there is a really good reason or something specific to look for we shouldn't do it. The author then mentions that researchers are looking for innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute knowledge over Venus. I think that is a good think to do but it can not be an option to send a human up there, because as long as you only send machines it is just money that you send up there, but with all the dangers it is stupid to send a human to Venus. He closes his article with the statement that we have to strive for new knowlegde beyond our Earth and I do agree with that but we have to look out what the dangers are and sometimes things are not possible, because we are very limited compared to the power of the universe.

So I think that we should keep looking for new innovations that can help us explore the universe but we have to accept that we are very small in a big universe and that not everything is possible for us because we are limited, while the universe is not.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Many children that play sports make a grade b average but for the ones that make average grades should still be qualified to play in sports or after school academics. Stopping a child from playing a sport that she or she is very well at and loves to do is wrong. You cant stop a child from doing something they love just for not making the grades that you want them to make. I agree grades are very important more important than sports nut you still half to let them play both things can help you in the future. There are a lot of boys and girls that will be very upset if they cant play there sports and that they are still passing.

By taking these sport privileges away there are going to be a lot of kids that just wont try or care about school any more and that will fall behind than not be able to get out from the mistake that they put them self into. there are many reasons why you should not take away sports for the children that attend school but these are my reasons why you should not.",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Summer break, most students favorite time of the year, the time of long hot summer days by the pool or even at the beach. This break given is a moderate period of time given to students and teachers throughout the hottest months of the year. Many children spend this time with their friends and family, some even take the opportunity to get a summer job. However some schools feel it is necessary to give their students an excessive amount of school work to do complete the summer. Many of these summer assignments are from classes including Math, English, and even some AP classes. Most summer assignments given do not provide an explanation of how to complete it, which leaves many students clueless and with no desire to complete their task. Students should be provide to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a drive to complete the work.

Summer break is supposed to be enjoyable days away from school with no stress. Giving these students school work over their times off is not fair to them nor is it fair to the teachers. When this work is given, large amounts of students choose not to complete it; or they chose to complete it but not with the best of their abilities. Most summer assignments that are given are not beneficial to the student when they return to school. In fact, many teachers do not discuss the summer assignment with the students and some have even chose to not put in the grade because many of their students did not complete it, which is not fair to the students that took the time out of their summer to complete it. With summer assignments being mandatory, students should be able to choose their assignments based on the classes they will be taking, in order to make their summer a little more enjoyable. No student wants to complete an assignment they have no interest in.

Almost all teachers a faculty spend their summer days off relaxing with their families and enjoying their time off, as they should. However they do not grade nor complete assignments for the students. Yes toward the end of the summer teachers have to go back to school earlier than their students to ensure their rooms are set up, cleaned, and ready for the children to return. School faculty also have to attend a few meetings together to make sure the upcoming school year will go smoothly. If students apply their summer time to the assignments the teachers should also apply their time to explaining the assignments throughly before their vaction.

A class that students need to have in order to continue learning over the summer, is math. Math is a subject that people use everyday. The assignments math teachers give should provide helpful ways for the student to learn and complete the assignment if it is something they may not know how to do. Most students do complete their summer assignments before summer break, which means they can ask for help from teachers around them. However some wait until they have down time to complete these assignments which causes them to forget how to complete it. All assignments that are given should give the student a clear understanding of how the teacher may want it to be completed, with an example to help assist the student for when the teacher is not around.

If the summer assignment that is assigned does not benefit the student and will not be brought up or discussed after they turn it in, it should not be given for them to complete on their days off. The assignments teachers assign are usually not enjoyable and take large periods of time to complete. If assignments must be given over the summer, students should have a choice from a variety of assignments to choose from; such as a power point on somewhere historical they could have visited over the summer or even reading a chosen book the class will read together during the upcoming school year

Students should not have to take time out of their days off the complete an assignment that will not help them in the up coming school year. Many students find summer assignments boting and unenjoyable, which is why they choose to not complete them. This is why students should be able to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a desire to do the work.   ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The text states many facts and statistics; therefore, the author supports this idea well, for he/she describes why astronomers are amazed by Venus, what NASA is planning on approaching the planet, and explaining the type of challenge it is to explore this dangerous ""Evening Star."" Reading the passage, the author is convincing about the subject that he/she has chosen.

The planet, Venus, is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, as the author suggests. Supporting this idea, the author shows many examples, facts, and ideas why he/she thinks Venus is a worthy planet to keep studying, for the text states, ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" The writer describes that important studies come out of exploring Venus's reputation, even though it is the hottest planet in our solar system. The author supports the claim that Venus has many thrilling factors in Paragraph 3. Paragraph 3, Line 6 states, ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to porbes seeking to land on its surface."" The author demonstrates his knowledge telling the readers that Venus cause many disasterous events that happen all around the world.

As the author claims that Venus is worth studying for, Paragraphs 4 through 7 shows evidence about scientists still studying Venus as of today and why geologists and atronomers are so fascinated with the blazing planet. In Paragraph 4, Line 2 states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Scientists state that even today, Venus has features that look like mountains, as read in the passage. Testing his knowledge in the prompt, the author demonstrates that NASA wants to make visiting Venus possible. Throughout Paragraphs 5 through 7, it states what NASA's (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) plan is to successfully observing Venus from a up-close point of view. In Paragraph 5, Line 2 and 3 state, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" As being stated as a ""possible solution,"" the author shows NASA's solution is not an effecient plan, for Paragraph 6, Lines 1 through 4 state, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges."" In the authors statement, NASA need samples of rocks, gas, and other types of samples to have a full discovery of Venus. Because of the obstacle in NASA's way, they decide to make other approaches to studying Venus, for they understand that meeting to Venus' standards will take years. Lastly, as the author's final example on why Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents is in Paragraph 8, which states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Or travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The narrator claims that exploring all of our options that have dangers should not limit us as human beings to give up and quit. He/she states that we should move along all of the doubts and dangers and increase our imagination on all levels.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. As the author states many facts on why scientists should continue their research on Venus, he/she supports their claim well. The passage describes why astronomers study Venus as well as what NASA is planning to do to approach the Evening Star. The writer believes that although Venus has many dangers to humans, we should take the challenge exploring Venus offers to us and go beyond our limits to achieve the goal that geologists, astronomers, and scientists want to acquire.

"Failure is an inevitable aspect of life, and it is an essential part of the journey towards success. Many people believe that success is only achieved through hard work and dedication, but failure plays a crucial role in shaping the path to success. Failure is a valuable lesson that teaches us to learn from our mistakes and to never give up on our dreams.

The fear of failure can be paralyzing for many young minds, and it can prevent them from pursuing their passions and aspirations. However, when we embrace failure as a necessary part of the journey towards success, we gain the hope of achieving our accomplishments. Failure teaches us to be more resilient and to never give up on our goals. It also helps us to identify our weaknesses and areas for improvement, which can lead to greater success in the long run.

Winston Churchill's statement ""What is Success Without Failure?"" highlights the importance of failure in achieving success. Churchill believed that success was not possible without failure, and that failure was a necessary part of the journey towards success. He understood that failure was not a setback, but rather an opportunity to learn and grow.

Young minds can benefit greatly from this mindset. When we teach children that failure is a normal and necessary part of life, we empower them to take risks and pursue their dreams. We also teach them to be more resilient and to never give up on their goals, even in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, failure is essential in the pursuit of success, and it plays a crucial role in shaping the path to success. Winston Churchill's statement ""What is Success Without Failure?"" highlights the importance of failure in achieving success. Young minds can benefit greatly from embracing failure as a necessary part of life, and it can give them the hope of achieving their accomplishments.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"I believe that driverless cars are not the best answer to drving. To me it's just another reason to make america or the whole world to be lazier. Yes it would be nice to have a taxi service that doesn't have a driver, but what about the people who drove those cars for a living, they would be put out of buisness.

When making a new car safety is key, in order to make such a car you have to be sure that everything is optimal for consumors to buy. If one car goes malfuntioning that would be bad for the company. Although the idea defeats the point of the driverless car. When people are stuck in traffic they don't want to sit there behind the wheel moving inch by inch, but the car cannot drive in such conditions as close traffic, consrtuction, sites or around accidents, Which is one of the reasons people want the auto driving car so they don't have to sit through that.

So to me driverless cars need more improvement in safety and manuverbility, or they're not going to get many sales on this product, and if it is produced many people will complain and probably end up with lawsuits and refunds.

On the other hand though if this idea was a possibility with more safety with no driver needed at all then any company that perfects the production first will be very rich indeed.",0,persuade_corpus,1

You may not agree with this person that gives you advice. They could give you advice that you may not really like.

That's why you want to go to multiple people to get advice from. When given advice, you want to at least agree with the person that is giving you the advice. If you don't you might not want to follow their advice anymore. If not just go to other people and see if they have any better advice.

"Online education has grown rapidly over the past decade, providing convenient and flexible opportunities for students to learn. By taking into account the diverse needs of students, educators can take advantage of online education to make up for missed school days due to personal, health, or sports considerations. Additionally, remote learning can ensure that students are not disadvantaged by weather-related cancellations, minimizing disruptions to schooling. 

In-person and online classrooms offer their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Time management is an important factor to consider; in online classrooms, students are often responsible for establishing their own study time, whereas an instructor can structure a traditional classroom to ensure that learning time is used efficiently. Furthermore, online learning can be less distracting, as students have more control over their environment. That said, online education can be lonely and isolating, as students miss out on conversations and collaborations with their peers. As such, it is important to weigh all potential factors before deciding between an online or in-person learning environment.

All in all, online education can meet a variety of needs, often allowing students to learn in a more flexible manner that suits their individual needs. With careful consideration of time management, distractions, and potential isolation, remote learning can be advantageous for students with missed school days or weather-related interruptions.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"In 1976, the Viking 1 took a photo of what was thought to be a 'face' on Mars. The 'face' had a shadow that loomed over the formation; the shadow making it appear as a human face. NASA was thrilled when the Viking 1 captured the picture. A few days after the team found it, NASA reveiled the picture to the public.

Ever since the photo was published, theorists have speculated over what the formation actually was. Many were to believe that it was an alien structure. In fact, it actually is not. The 'alien artifact' is actually a mesa. Mesas are commonly found on planets such as Earth. There would be no possible way that the mesa would be an alien structure.

In the passage, NASA has been taking pictures of it from 1976, 1998, and 2001. Since then, the images have been sharper. In 2001, the picture clearly shows a mesa, not a face. When the latest photo was taken, Malin's team had made the digital picture three times sharper than the rest of the photos. He states that if you were to take a picture of pyramids or other formations, you would be able to clearly see what they were.

The 'Face on Mars' is just a conspiracy theory. No one can actually confirm that there is such thing to exist. If there was such thing on Mars, NASA would probably examine it a bit closer and may reveal to the public about it, but for now, we can only wonder if there really is a face on Mars.

"Phones and Driving

Danger has fascinated humans for centuries. So has technological advancements or just technology in general. Cell phones are a wonderful thing just like driving is a wonderful thing but like an open flame and gasoline, who said they should go together? Texting while driving has led to way too many deaths. While common sense should tell you not to deviate attention form the road where you're not just driving for yourself but for everyone else, people still do it even though they shouldn't.

People shouldn't text and drive because deviating your attention from something serious can only end up bad. If you were hiding from Jason Voorhees, scared for your life, would you watch a YouTube video? Of course not, because you are focused on staying safe. Driving should be treated the same way because one bad decision could result in a multicar collision and someone dead.

In the state of Georgia, there is a law against a driver being on their phone because of the reasons stated in the previous paragraph. There is also a fine of $150.00 as a punishment. That's better that being a number in the 1.6 million people who die every year due to texting a driving. Or the better case would be just not being on your phone and texting in the first place. Wouldn't you agree?

The final way to stop these fatalities is to put your cell phone in driving mode. Newer model cars with the Bluetooth feature allow this feature to be enabled.

That feature blocks all notifications until you are out of the vehicle. That makes it safe for the driver by taking their mind of their phone and helps others by keeping the drivers mind focused on the road.

That's a true definition of safety first.

Driving is a privilege has always been true but it matters more and more every year as more people get distracted by the newest feature on their phone. Whatever is on Instagram can't be more important than your life. As more people replace their cars for the newest car that Bluetooth feature will be widely available to more people. As technology advances, people's urgency of safety while driving should too. What's more important, what Kim Kardashian just did on Snapchat, or your life and everyone else's?

"Global warming is one of the main reason, maybe the only reason the is destroying the atmosphere. Humans today are trying to prevent global warming because if we continue to pollute the atmosphere it can very well kill most of the living things, maybe all of the living thing on this planet, including humans ourselfs. I think reducing the usage of cars today is a great way to stop global warming.

One of the countries that are taking action in doing this is the countries is France. Paris has decided to partially ban driving to clear the air of the global city. In the text it states that, ""on Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their car at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)."" This show that paris is trying to get rid of the smog in the air, and now they are asking their citizens to stop driving their cars, bike ect. Also if you don't partcipate in you will have to pay a fine of 22-euro. In addition one of the main subsatnces to motor pollution is diesel feul. the passage says that, ""diesel was the blame, since the France has...[a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" Since France favors the usage of diesel, this one of the main reason why they have forbidden the use of motor in paris. Moreover it states that;""deisel make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of the Western Europe."" This again also proves that diesel plays a major role in the pollution of France. As you can see France is making changings to there country due to the global warming.

France is not the only one that has taken action by reducing the car usage. The city BOGOTA, Colombia has also changed their ways in cutting down on car usage.""Millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,"" the text states. What this is trying to explain is that Columbia has a program that prevents the citizens from using vehicles, so the whole day they usa bikes, skates, and take the bus, even some of them go hiking to wherever they go. Consequently there are some benefits to having a car, such as basic transportation needs. In the text it states that,""but America's love affair with is vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily.""Although driving is something essential to human needs these days, it is also very killing. As you can see other countries have taken part in this struggle to prevent global warming to get any worst.

In conclusion the reduction of using vehicle today can be one big step in slowing down the rate of global warming, although taking away cars me be a major problem to in basic transportation needs, it is better than killing everything on the planet.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4

"School Sport Policy

To whom it may concern:

The recent notice of changing the policy about students participating in sports must have a B average instead of a C average is a wonderful idea. This would cause student athletes to be more responsible, and think twice when it comes to stupid decisions.

First off, students that want to participate in a school sport would force them to get better grades to do something they love to do. Students would try harder in there classes versus the student athletes who get so-so grades and are missing assignments. Most student athletes do well in school anyway so they wouldn't get major affected by this change.

Secondly, this would make the student athletes think twice about making stupid decisions. for example it would most likely make the student do there homework every night. Also it would make some student athletes think twice about ditching school

Some people may argue that this new policy would put stress on student athletes, worrying about how they have to get good grades. That is what school is all about, pretty much if you do your homework every night, listen to instructions, and come to school every day, i guarantee you student athletes wouldn't have to worry about a thing.

In conclusion students with at least a B average will be able to play a sport versus a C average. This would make students think twice about some decisions. also it would teach student athletes about responsibility. If all student athletes did all what there supposed to do, they WILL play sports.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"I think that students should not participate in sports only if they do not have a B average in their classes they take. Only because that's not fair to the people that have B average grades and they work hard in school so they can play the sport that they want or love to do. And to the people who want to play in soccer or volleyball that have a C average grade should not do any activities to show them that they need to work hard in school to get what they deserve.

So lets say if you wanted to play soccer and so did I but you were a student that had a C average grade then me as a friend would tell you to get your act together and get not a B average grade but an A+ grade. So I think this is a lesson to most student if you want something that you can't have then get your act together and fight for what you want which is good grades to play whatever you want to play or do.

So in other words I would have agree with the principal. Only because I believe you have to fight for what you want especially in high school. There really strict about having good grades to do any other activities including sports. But if you wanted to do extra work to get to the B or A average grade then do it, it's worth the A or B to do what you want to do. To show you that you actually can do it.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Benefits of Active Engagement and Participation

Staying active and engaged is crucial for personal growth and development. By actively participating in activities, individuals can experience numerous benefits that can positively impact their lives. In this essay, we will explore the advantages of an active lifestyle and compare it to an idle lifestyle. We will also examine the importance of motivation and commitment in the workplace and investigate examples of individuals who have improved due to active participation. Additionally, we will discuss the consequences of being idle and how individuals should strive to be productive and motivated regardless of their circumstances.

Advantages of Active Lifestyle

An active lifestyle offers numerous benefits that can improve an individual's physical and mental health. Firstly, engaging in activities can help individuals maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Secondly, physical activity can improve mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, engaging in activities can help individuals develop new skills, meet new people, and improve their overall quality of life.

Idle Lifestyle vs Active Lifestyle

In contrast, an idle lifestyle can lead to numerous negative consequences. Firstly, an idle lifestyle can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can increase the risk of chronic diseases and poor mental health. Secondly, an idle lifestyle can lead to a lack of motivation and commitment, which can negatively impact an individual's personal and professional growth. Finally, an idle lifestyle can lead to a lack of fulfillment and purpose, which can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and unhappiness.

Importance of Motivation and Commitment in the Workplace

In the workplace, motivation and commitment are essential for success. Individuals who are motivated and committed are more likely to be productive, efficient, and achieve their goals. Motivation and commitment can also lead to increased job satisfaction and a sense of purpose. On the other hand, individuals who lack motivation and commitment are more likely to be unproductive, inefficient, and fail to achieve their goals.

Examples of Individuals who have Improved due to Active Participation

There are numerous examples of individuals who have improved due to active participation. For instance, individuals who participate in regular exercise and physical activity have improved their physical health and reduced the risk of chronic diseases. Additionally, individuals who participate in hobbies and activities",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Some children nowadays don't like to confront people with their prblems or they are too scared to ask for help. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions os tudents in a classroom is valuable. Its is valuable because it can detect problems in students before it's too late.

It's impotant to know what students are feeling to make sure they are comfortable, genuinely happy and interested. Since this technology can calculate the emotions from the way muscles contract on your face, it'll be easy to detect a problem without asking them when they can easily lie. You need to keep the students interested because if they are not interested in what you are teaching then they will not pay attention and won't get anything from the lesson at all. With this technology, they can have a better chance of getting better grades or have a better prespective on the subject.

There are many risks from not knowing exactly what the student is feeling. They could be feeling anxious, depressed or even scared. Anxiety and depression are two major and risky mental health problems. People who have it may not want to talk about it or even share that they have it. With thus facial recognition, they will be detected as sad or scared and you can be able to get them the help they deserve and need. We have many muscles in our face and all of them can identify in the categories of sad or scared.

"When you ask for advice do you ask multiple people or just one person? from my experience its better to get more peoples advice then just one. I believe that it is better to ask multiple people for advice instead of just asking one person because if you ask multiple people then you have a higher chance to get better advice than if you only ask one person, you will get more advice than if you just ask one person, and you will also become closer friends with the people you ask for advice.

Firstly, I think that asking multiple people for advice is better because if you ask more people then you have a higher chance to get better advice than if you just ask one person. Also if you get better advice then you wont have to ask more people for advice. Plus when you get better advice you will probably do better then if you had worse advice or none at all. The better the advice the better you'll do at what ever your trying to do no matter what it is advice always helps.

Next, I think that its better to ask more people for advice because the more advice the more it helps, first because you will remember it better and also because you will get different and better advice. another reason why getting more advice is better is because you will get different viewpoints and you will also get to see things from other peoples points of view.

Finally, you will get closer to the people you ask for advice because they know that you would not come to them if you didn't trust them so they will know that you trust them and they will trust you more. Plus if they trust you more then you will be able to talk to them about more personal stuff like help with problems like depression, anxiety, or stress and they will be there for you no matter what.

Like I said before I believe that asking for advice from multiple people is better and you should ask at least three people for advice but the more the merrier. Dont forget that the more people you ask for advice the more types of advice you will get and possibly the better advice you will get. I believe that if you ask for advice from more then one person the better advice you will get, the more advice you will get, the closer you will get to you friends.",0,persuade_corpus,1

The reasons to change to elction by popular vote is because under the elctoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Also, the Elctoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The reason why you change to elction by popular votes is because under the elctoral college system voters vote not for the president, bur for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. There's been argument about this change. For example, the single best argument against the elctoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. This can turn in to the 2000 fiasco when was the biggest election crisis.

The Elctoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This also confused voters sometimes when vote for the wrong candiate. The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the elctoral vote. This can make the election get thrown to the house of representatives, which make the state deglations vote of the president. The Electoral College is unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, includin Rhode Island and South Carolina.

"The four passages provided explain that less and less people are buying cars and obtaining licences because of the multiple advantages it provides such as reduced polution, reduced stress, and reduced trafic.

All, four passages mention that an up side of limiting car usage would reduce pollution around the world.  In paragraph five it mentions that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states.""  By reducing the amount of cars driven in these areas we could reduce the amount of polution.  Due to large amounts of smog created by polution in France, banning was put on drivers with even license plates for one day. This is shown in paragraph 19, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" This shows how much can change in just one car-free day.

Not driving cars can also reduce stress. The families in Vauban, Germany experience less stress when not driving and instead walk or ride a bike. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two stated in paragraph three, ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.'"" Even though this is just one oppinion, it is safe to say that the other residents in the community are feeling the same way. In Bogota, Columbia a car-free day has been that has been held annually for three years has a businessman named Carlos Arturo Plaza saying in paragraph 24 ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.'"" Not driving cars obviously is a way of lowering stress.

Finnaly, not driving can reduce traffic in heavly populated areas. In paragraph 14 it shows how not driving can reduce traffic, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog."" In just five days traffic was down 60 percent! Imagine what a few car-free weeks or months could do. Again back to Bogota, Columbia, paragraph 20 states ""...Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" This shows that car-free days can even be done in large cities.

In the end, even though life without cars would be difficult there are many more pros than cons to living without cars.  The pros being less polution, less stress, and less traffic.                             ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Dear principle,

The cell phone use policy's have come to my attention.

Your students use their phones almost every period.

Your cell phone rule in place right now is not working. The kids get away with texting in class and it is distracting to their work which lowers their grades.

The policy in place right now is that your students can bring their phone to school, but they have to have it turned off.

The kids use their phones anyway.

When you tell them not to use their phones, they are going to use them anyway.

If you tell them they could use their phones at lunch and during their free time they will not use them as much, during class.

Your students grades are dropping and it is because of the cell phone use during class.

Policy number two will be the best policy for your students.

It show them you trust them a lot more and if they need to call their parents that is the time to do it instead of going to the bathroom to call them.

Trust me, I'm a student.

Sincerely,

Your

Favorite

"will kids should actually bring cell phones to school the reason it takes kids education away and kids don't listen to what the teacher is saying. even though some kids still bring their cell phones and end up getting taking away. the principal from others school don't let the kids bring cell phones but the kids still do they really don't listen. and they end up in trouble and cell phone taking away. the kids that bring there cell phone to they can be in danger too like they can be talking with a stranger tell them to meet them after school or in some place.

kids could bring their cell phones too school but to have them off before entering there classes. so they wont get there cell phone taking away or get in trouble or in danger kids need to stop bringing there cell phones to school and listen to what the teachers in school have to say. like if there is a test and the kids are texting how are they going to know about it when their not really listening to what she is saying. kids are not even suppose to have a cell phone its a policy if you have it or not its up too the parents.

and plus kids bring their cell phones to school and they end up get stole or broke and the parents end up getting really mad at them. kids could text talk on the phone mostly after school not in school because we all come to learn not to really fool around. if kids keep on fooling around their is no education for them. in free times kids could use their phone it depends if the teachers let them. its not policy that you really have too use your phone like who are you going to chat with when your friends are right next too you. other times in school kids still use their phones and no one actually tells them anything .

And why would principals even let kids bring their cell phones to school just putting their life in danger. And the kids are not getting full education the one that they are going to need in life a cell phone can take off your mind off of the education just by a little text the at the kids can see after school nothing is going to happen too you if you don't see the text like right at that time. you have class at that time no free time or anything. you go to because your learning something that your going to need when you get older. with out you learning this skills what are you going to do in life nothing right.

Our school principal doesn't let us bring our cell phones to school and some kids do understand and other act like if they misunderstood. but once they get in trouble there would understand. some kids just need too stop texting during class get there work that their goanna need. and plus of course study for some big tests that may come out. and if kids are missing work why don't just do it? instead of texting or just fooling around school not doing anything. your life something that you need. skill what your going to use during your lifetime and college",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Do you know some of the main reasons people seek out different opinions to make a better choice? if you want to know the answer to that question, please feel free to read on.

The first reason why people seek out multiple opinions to make a better choice is for wisdom . With wisdom you can get life experience from other people. They might have dealt with it so you can ask what they did to help or solve the situation. You can ask them what they would've done better or different to resolve the conflict.

Another reason people seek out multiple opinions to help make a better choice is different point of views and opinions . They do this because you can get different people's perspective. You can also see how they would feel about the situation. You can see what they would do and how they would react in the situation.

Finally, that last and final reasons people would get multiple opinions to make a better decision is so they can have options . Having options means you can get new ideas on how to take the task head on. You can also get ideas on how to approach the problem and solve it. You can see what other people would have done with the problem, get estimates on what the end result would have been if they would have done it that way, and choose the options that is best for you and the situation. You can also have more options to choose from on how to do and resolve the task at hand.

I believe the getting wisdom from others, having options, and having different opinions or, point of views is why people seek out multiple opinions to make a better choice.  ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The president of the United States should be decided by the Electoral College process, not by most popular vote. There are many reasons why we should keep the way we vote the same.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in it's Congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of Representatives and plus two for your senators. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. When we vote this way, there's a certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign effforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Ellectoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the Constistution.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

We definatly need to continue using the Electoral College process. The most popular vote process wouldn't be an ideal way to elect a president.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2

"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly disagree with the idea of extending school hours. While some may argue that more hours in school will lead to better academic performance, I believe that the potential consequences of adding more hours to school are far greater than the benefits.

First and foremost, students are more likely to not pay attention during class when they are tired. Studies have shown that students' attention spans decrease as the day goes on, and adding more hours to school will only exacerbate this issue. Students will become more fatigued, which will lead to a decline in academic performance and a decrease in engagement in class.

Secondly, students are more likely to disrespect teachers when they are tired. When students are tired, they are more likely to become irritable and frustrated, which can lead to disrespectful behavior towards teachers. This can create a hostile classroom environment, which is not conducive to learning.

Finally, adding more hours to school can lead to an uprising among students. Students are already stressed and overwhelmed with schoolwork, and adding more hours to school will only make things worse. This can lead to a decrease in student morale and an increase in absenteeism.

Instead of extending school hours, I suggest making the additional hours optional after-school activities. These activities can be used to learn more about life and school. For example, students can participate in clubs, sports, or volunteer opportunities. This will allow students to pursue their interests and passions while still providing them with the opportunity to learn and grow.

In conclusion, while some may argue that extending school hours will lead to better academic performance, the potential consequences of adding more hours to school are far greater than the benefits. Instead of extending school hours, I suggest making the additional hours optional after-school activities, which students can use to learn more about life and school.

"Automobiles have proved to be very convenient to our modern day society. It allows people to travel 20 miles in ten to fifteen minutes. By foot, it would take about four hours to travel that distance. Although cars have been beneficial, the limitation of car usage would outweigh the benefits of constantly relying on them. Decreasing the amount of time we spend in them would improve public transportation, improve air quality, and create less stress.

Cutting down the amount of car usage would encourage the use of public transportation. According to Source 1, the essentially car-less suburban, Vanbaun, has made public transportation more accessible. Increasing the use of it would decrease the time it takes to commute from place to place. Less cars on the roads mean less traffic. In small towns, not as many people currently use the system on a regular basis. With the limiting of car usage, public transportation could become more popular in suburban areas, not just metropolitan cities. Some may not want to take this form of transportation because it may not meet their sanitary needs. However, if the popularity increases, cities will be obligated to improve the conditions. Public transportation could be the new primary form of transportation if we limit the amount of time cars are allowed to be used.

Additionally, a large problem in the world today is air pollution and globabl warming. Automobiles cause the majority of this ongoing problem. Less time spent in the car would eventually lead to better air quality. Source 2 states that in Paris, France the smog in the city was near-record pollution. This caused Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Congestion was cut down 60% after this action was taken. Vehicles release numerous harmful greenhouse gases that we have been trying to reduce. These gases not only harm the environment, but the people as well. New and popular alternatives to the common diesel cars are hybrids and electric cars. Less car usage would result in reduction of pollution.

Also, using a car less decreases stress levels. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in the very popular car-free day. A businessman in Colombia said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" Cars do not allow people's mind to stop and rest. A driver's mind is constantly thinking and attempting to get to their destination as fast as possible. If cars were barely used, people could take a serene stroll to their destination, allowing the mind to slow down, think, and relax. Parks and recreation would expand and improve as well due to the smaller vicinity we can reach by foot or bike. New and improved public areas would become more enjoyable, making us less stressed. Stress levels decline as car usage declines.

The increased use of public transportation, improved air quality, and lower stress levels all result from the limitations of car usage. As beneficial as a car may be to people, limiting the use of it is more advantageous than not. Car companies are still widely developing as highways and roads are expanding, but our society should go the other direction and find healthier sources of transportation.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"English as a Second Language (ESL) programs have become increasingly popular in schools around the world as more and more students are learning English as their second language. These programs are designed to help students who are not native English speakers to improve their language skills and become more proficient in English.

One of the main benefits of ESL programs is that they provide students with the opportunity to practice their English skills in a structured and supportive environment. These programs typically include a variety of activities and exercises that are designed to improve vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and other language skills. Students are often paired with native English speakers who act as language partners, allowing them to practice their conversational skills and gain confidence in their ability to speak English.

ESL programs also provide students with the opportunity to learn about the culture and customs of the country where they are studying. This can be especially helpful for students who are planning to study or work in an English-speaking country in the future. By learning about the culture and customs of the country, students can better understand and appreciate the language and its role in the community.

In addition to the benefits for the students, ESL programs can also have a positive impact on the school community as a whole. By providing students with the opportunity to learn English, schools can help to foster a more diverse and inclusive community. This can be especially important in today's globalized world, where it is increasingly important for students to be able to communicate with people from different backgrounds and cultures.

Overall, ESL programs are an important tool for schools to help students improve their English skills and become more proficient in the language. These programs provide students with the opportunity to practice their skills in a structured and supportive environment, learn about the culture and customs of the country where they are studying, and foster a more diverse and inclusive school community.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Should summer projects be student or teacher-designed?

Generic_City has some of the smartest and extremely qualified staff in the nation. The teachers in this county have degrees from some of the most prestigious universities in America. Teachers are always prepared to teach the curriculum to the best of their abilities. Partially due to their efforts we have some of the highest

SAT

and exam scores in the nation. It would only make sense for teachers to design a project that they think would be beneficial to all new incoming students based on their experience through prior years. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers can base them around the their curriculum and needs of the upcoming class.

With teacher-designed summer projects teachers can give work they believe is most appropriate and beneficial for their curriculum during the school year. During the school year, the teacher is the individual who creates the worksheets and teaches the new course work, so who's better to prepare from than the source itself. Students taking that class should be prepared by having an overview of the new course work from the teacher. Teachers are familiar to the little basics most students forget coming into their class from previous years therefore, they incorporate the extra practice into the summer assignments and/or projects.

Teachers have a better insight on the students coming into their class the next year. Every class is different, a group of students may have a weakness in a certain unit that maybe the previous class didn't. Teachers can look at the previous year average grades of the new incoming class and tweak and adjust the projects based on the needs of the majority of incoming students. Teachers are able to talk to other teachers to get an insight on the students coming in during the fall and therefore, able to create a project or assignment that is most beneficial to all students.

Granted, there are times student-designed assignments are beneficial because sometimes teachers may not fully realize or understand the students need more preparation for a specific skill to thrive in their class. Alumni students can help by giving a better insight on the subjects that should be brushed up on. Although, this can be very beneficial to some students who learn a similar way, others may not have an issue with that specific topic or skill. It may be a strength for them and they would just be wasting their time on one specific skill when they could be working on a weakness of theirs. To avoid bias in summer assignments it is best to leave the assignments for teachers to create since they give more of an overview of the topics and generally don't go in depth on one specific skill but still prepare students enough to where they know what they'll be learning in their class.

Summer assignments should be teacher assigned to eliminate bias from students and receive work that is beneficial to all students. Teachers have connections with other staff members to make sure the incoming class is prepared and have all the basics down to thrive in their class during the new school year. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I strongly believe that it is important for students to do community service. I will be telling you why I believe this throughout my essay. First of all, i will explain why I agree with this topic. Second of all, I will tell you why it is important for them to volunteer. as you continue reading my essay you will find more details about why I agree.

To begin with, i agree with this topic because most kids are lazy. Volunteering will help them overcome that laziness. If students volunteer just once because they have to and they end up enjoying it then they will end up doing it a lot. It is good for a kid to volunteer because they will feel good about them selves if they know they did something good. This is why i agree with this topic.

Secondly, It is important for kids all ages to volunteer. for example, when you're applying for a college most of them look into if you volunteer. also, if you volunteer you will feel like you did something good for the community. if you volunteer you most likely be rewarded which a lot of people enjoy. these are a few reasons why i think it is important for kids to volunteer.

"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? Most students would agree to do their own designed instead of using the teacher designed because the student can come up with lots of reasons for their project just by learning in a quicker way than other people. Students like me could get in a good mood to make their project entertaining with different images, designs, color and etc. I can think of variety of reasons why i would use student designed instead of using teacher designed. I think using the teacher designed would be way to difficult for most students to understand. Those who state that using the teacher designed is a better choice because its easier to use just because the teacher gave out a easy topic to use but this not true. Although some may disagree, about using the student designed is very bias because they think it should be easy to get the project done without thinking on their own.

Therefore, being responsible of the actions that a student have during their class time with learning on how to do a project and what materials to use for the project can be a big affect on that student grade dealing with that designs, colors and etc they need for their student design project to be done correctly. Students need to take ownership in what they do and become more of a leader so other students can become like the students thats being that leader. Most students have to pay closely attention and follow instructions when the teacher is given out what they have to do because if the teacher assigned a project to do over the break and they do it wrong or they didnt know what to do thats their fault because they should have been paying attention to the teacher while she was giving out the instructions during that class time. As the student think about what they want their topic to be about on the student designed project they always can look up different designs topics on the internet or go look in a design book at different images or quotes about awesome designs.

Even though, the teacher designed project probably have an easier topic and easier thoughts to get through i still think we as students should pick the student designed topic because you can have multiple reasons why you choose that heading and you have a chance to draw what you like to do or see and you can color the images and borders with whatever colors you love to use.

Although, I will agree on choosing my own student design because i love to draw and color things thats what i been doing since i was younger I been wanted to do it for a long period of time especially due to a project thats dealing with animals,sports,cartoons, or anything else that really entertain me. Some students love to do the exact same thing as me because thats the most easiest and interesting part of the project to do. I can work in a reasonable time according to my project topic because i know a lot about certain animals, sports, cartoons, and anything else. Its very easy for me to think what i am gonna write and draw about if i use one of those topics i can guarantee its gonna be an easy task for my teacher to grade. Students should always think of their own ideas and topics before they get home dealing with an individual project that the teacher assigned to do over the break to be finish correctly when we get back to school after the break over with.

In conclusion, i agree students should make sure they choose their best topic dealing with the teacher designed project or the student designed project during the time the teacher had assigned it, because its very easy to do if the student payed attention to the teacher instructions and know what ideas and reasons they gonna have about the student designed project.

Although, some may disagree, about using the student designed is very bias because they think it should be easy to get the project done without thinking of their own but this is not true.                                     ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Outer space is a mystery within itself, but the addition of the planets and stars are just an expansion to those mysteries. The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" was written for readers to understand how a planet that may be different in design can be the most important reason as to why it should be taken a look at. The author compares and contrasts Venus with Earth and Mars to emphasize what Venus has to offer. Venus may not be the easiest task to complete, but that should encourage people to push the exploration of the planet.

Venus may have a variation of attributes compared to Earth and Mars, but that shouldn't stop people from exploring the planet. Since Earth and Venus are considered ""twins,"" they are similar according to their, ""...density and size, and occasionally their distance too."" (2) The author also mentions how Venus could have once been the, ""...most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" With that being said, if Venus was similar to Earth in its lifetime, then it could answer pondering questions like ""Is there any other signs of life on other planets?"" Just like Earth, Venus has, ""valleys, mountains, and craters."" (4) Venus' similar characteristics to Earth makes it an interesting mission for scientists.

Sending man to the moon wasn't the easiest trip, but it got done. So, why shouldn't Venus be explored too? Venus is said to have, ""...hostile conditions on the surface,"" (5) and it is considered, ""inhospitable."" (4) Both phrases do not appear to be the most promising when deciding if landing on Venus is the best choice, but beyond those risks could be life changing discoveries. This mission is impossible because humans are able to make, ""machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully.""

Traveling to Venus doesn't have to be the most difficult plan. Space travel already is a timely mission, but Venus is said to, ""...sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" If Venus is a close visit, then scientists should be even more compelled to search the planet. Scientist have come up with smart ideas to observe Venus like, ""a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape."" (5) With this the vehicle is close enough to explore without humans dying or the vehicle frying. The heat is dangerous, but scientists could obtain important information they've been wanting to find out.

The author informs readers on the risks of traveling to Venus. Venus is not the safest place to be close to, but dangers have never stopped people from making trips into space in the past. Venus provides many opportunities that people have to be willing to take and learn from. Danger is nothing new to society, so traveling to Venus is only the newest obstacle to bypass.

"Dear State Senator,

MONTH_DAY_YEAR

In this essay I will be explaining why the Electoral College shouldn't be kept,and why we should do a popular vote instead to determine the president of the United States.

In my opinion we should do a popular vote because we U.S. citizens know what we want. The Electoral College may know what they want for themselves as a unit but honestly I think that the United States should stick to a popular vote. In an article I read called ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it states that state legislatures can technically be picking electors that will always defy the will of the people. I notice this to be very unfair because if electors are always going to defy what we say and want why should we vote. Isn't one of America's #1 catch phrases ""

power to the people

"" well in this case it seems to be ""

power to the Electoral Collage

"". In this article it also states that in many cases  ""

faithless

"" electors have ocassionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please! So if the electors can choose for whomever they please why can't we. I also think that the Electoral College is unfair because of the winner-take-all system. Candidates don't have to spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. While they go to the states that they know they have a absolute chance of winning in and take those winning votes. So in this case I have to agree with Bob Dole: Abolish the Electoral College!

I also think its wrong that voters can't always control who their voting for because we all the freedom to our own opinions and in the process of the Electoral Collage they are basically just throwing all opinions in the trash. They obviously don't care and I see this as completely irrational and unfair. I know that may use the Elecotoral Collage as a way to keep everyone calm but I think if they were to let the people vote they wouldn't have to be worried about us not being calm because that's us getting what we want and therefore why are we going to complain. I also consider the Electoral Collage electors high class. So in this case they are going to want to vote for the benefit of them, I think this is unfair to the lower-income families because if the electors choose a president that is going to want to take all the benefits away from lower-income families how are they going to live? How are they going to survive.""Remember ""

"There is no question that the driverless car is a technological advancement in today's society. However there is a very, very importanat question that has yet be completely answered. The question is this; is the full use of a driverless car a necessary technological advancement? The answer is yes to this important question, as the driverless car is a necessary technological advancement. The first reason is the infinite possibilities taht a driverless car offers that would benefit society. The second reason is the safety that a driverless car could offer if it's completed fully. Both of these reasons in support of the driverless car could benefit society in many ways. The technological advancement of the driverless car is a necessary one and would benefit society.

The developmentment of a driverless car would offer infinite possiblities that would provide many important benefits. One such benefit is that the driver would have the ability to both rest and relax. some may argue that the driver should never be resting and relaxing when at the wheel. However, if the driverless car was completely developed then there wouldnt be a need for the driver. A car driving itself while the driver relaxes is a better alternative than a tired sriver. Also, as mentioned in the passage, if every car was driverless, the transportation efficiency / speed would excel. If every fleet car was on the same system, the transportation would be both efficient and flawless,

There's a common saying that computers do not make mistakes no matter what circumstance. Of course, if a car is driverless then it will be on a completely computerized system. Think of a car that makes no mistakes. Would this not result in much higher saftey? Think of a driver that makes no mistake. Would this not result in a much higher saftey? A common person would want the highest safety that they have while they are driving. Unsafe driving is a result of driver mistakes, so what if the driver made no mistake. The answer to the concern of unsafe driving is the driverless car, without a doubt. Use of driverless cars would definitely be the safest way of transportation that is possible.

Clearly, the development of a driverless car is one of society's very great technological advancements. The question still remains that the devlopment of driverless car a necessary technological advancemnt. The answer to this question has yet to be determined to the point where it'S certain. People will continue to develop their own answer, until the question is fully answered for them. The answer to the question is yes, as the devlopment of driverless cars is necessary. The use of a driverless car would provide infinite possibilities in today's very problemed transportation world. Also they would provide maximum safety to those wh are being transportated in the transportation world.

"Some schools has started offering distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online and or video conference, but some people don't think students will benefit from it while others think this is an incredible opportunity for students. some will argue that students will benefit more from distant learning than being stuck in a classroom because they can move at their own pace and not have to worry about being left behind by their other peers in the classroom. Also, students may need additional help so if they need that extra attention they can get it because it's just the student and the instructor. Next, Distant learning can help students who are behind make up credits they need to graduate and still take the classes they are supposed to be in. Although, Distant learning has its benefits people will argue that students will not benefit from distant learning. students will just take this opportunity for granted and need to be held responsible like everyone else and pass the class in the classroom.

Distant learning can be argued that students will not get the information the same as if they were in the classroom. Because students are not there physically with a teacher they are more likely to cheat then if they were at school taking a test. Then, there is no guarantee that students will open up their laptop or turn in their computer screen everyday. Also,It's more distractions at home than it is at school because students are going to be more worried about whats on Netflix or whats in the refrigerator to eat than paying attention to the instructor on the computer screen. Finally, students wouldn't have the same motivation to get up like they do when coming to school everyday to see their friends, significant others, and their best friends.

I personally think that students will not benefit from distant learning. I say that because it would be more of the class clowns and the students who didn't apply them selves in the program more than the kids who actually needs it. Wouldn't be fair for the students who works hard in the classroom and deals with all the distractions. Lets be realistic if you are not special ed you are more than capable to pass a class in the classroom with the rest of the students if you put your mind to it. I personally feel like schools are giving students too many ways for them to be lazy in the classroom. schools should hold students more accountable for the work they put in their work if the student is not doing the work he should be able to go home and take the class online when they are students giving it all they got in the classroom.

Distant learning has it's pros and cons but I feel like it has more cons than pros. Students are more than capable to do their work in a classroom and doesn't have to do work online in a classroom. What happens when you applying for college or a job and you need a teacher recommendation and your teacher was a robot in a computer reading you instructions how are you going to get a teacher recommendation ?

How about when you don't understand how something is being explained to you on the computer and you have no classmates to explain it to you in a easier way? what are students going to do when times like that happen ?

I'm going to tell you whats going to happen they are going to just give up or quit or they are just going to write down any answer or just answer anything just to get it done and end up failing the assignment, when he or she can't get teacher recommendations for college or a job he is not going to get accepted in the college or not get hired for the job. What i'm trying to say is that going to school might be a little more difficult, might not like going to school, probably would be anywhere else in the word than be at school, being at school gives you more opportunities in life than online school because the kid next to you could be a boss at a million dollar company and could offer you a job just because he went to high school with you.

"Its no secret that driving automobiles has alot to do with how much pollution is pumped into the air. The biggest issue with driving a car in crowded areas is the smog build up. Many countrys have taken an interest in limiting cars temporarly to decrease smog, or dedicating individual communitys to a car free area with the exception of buses and taxis.

High pollution levels is a rising epedemic that needs to be stoppped before it is out of hand or un-reversable. Many country's plan to action is limiting car usage for a certain amount of time untill the smoge is under control. It states in source two paragraph ten that ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Within the five days that this rule was enforced the smog in the city had decreased by 60 percent.

Many people tend to rely on cars in their everday life. What people need to realize is that there are other forms of transportation that is just as easy and far less toxic to the planet and to ourselfs. In source 1 paragraph 3 a woman states "" when i had a car i was always tense, im much happier this way."" It is clear that the use and want for owning and using your own car has went down emensly since 1995. People call it a cultural shift excpecially in America where cars are so heavily manufactured and bragged about.

In conclusion, cars are a huge reason why the world is so polluted. This wouldnt be such an issue if so many people didnt use cars in their everday life. Once poeple realize that they can still be perfectly content without having to drive everywhere is when this planet will make a big turn around in the way we try to protect the planet.

"The Unmasking Face on Mars is just a natural landform on Mars. Many objects on Earth can resemble a face it could just be a mountain of sand that some how looks like a face. In the article it claims of huge rock formation that ""resembles"" a face. The picture was taken by a space craft at a far away distance forming shadowing giving the ""illusion"" of a nose, eyes, and mouth.

First, the reason why the ""face"" is a natural landform is because on Earth you can compare a face in many objects around you. Some natural landforms on Earth such as Middle Butte in the Snake river Plain of Idaho looks like it has a face also. You can make out a face in even day to day objects. Even a tree near your neighborhood could look like a ""face"".

Secondly, the reason why the ""face"" is just a natural landform is because the huge rock formation causes shadows. The shadows of the huge formation of rock can create the illusion of a face. The shadows can make it look like it has a nose, eyes, and mouth like structure in cases such as this one.

Lastly, the ""face"" on Mars is a natural landform because the photo was taken by a satelite. The pictures come in pixels meaning it could come out blury or unclear to clarify. The shadowing of the mound also gives the illusion in the picture of a ""face"". The ""face"" on Mars is only a natural landform that was mistaken as something else more than that because of the illusion of a face.      ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Mr. Brown,

I am writing to propose an adjustment to our school's policy regarding academic eligibility for participation in school sports and activities. After researching our current policy and those of other schools, I believe that making the change to require a B average in order to stay eligible for these activities could have a positive impact on our students' academic performance.

The research I have conducted shows that schools that have these types of policies in place have seen improved grades among students who participate in school sports or activities. Furthermore, these standards could help motivate students to achieve higher grades and reach their academic goals.

I realize that implementing this change could be met with some opposition, but I believe it could have lasting positive benefits for the students at our school.

I look forward to discussing this proposal further with you and getting your feedback.

"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about online classes for students who need extra help! 😃 As an 8th grader, I know that sometimes it can be tough to keep up with schoolwork, especially when you're struggling with a particular subject. That's where online classes come in! 🤓

So, one of the best things about online classes is that you can access help from a teacher whenever you need it. Like, you can't always get help from your regular teacher during class, but with online classes, you can get help from a teacher who's specifically trained to help you. It's like having your own personal tutor, but way more convenient! 📚

Another reason why online classes are so beneficial is that they can help you work at your own pace. Like, if you're really struggling with math, you can take an online class that's specifically designed to help you catch up. And the best part is, you can do it on your own time, so you don't have to worry about missing out on other classes. 🕒

But, there are also some challenges that might prevent some students from getting the help they need. Like, sometimes the internet can be really slow or unreliable, and that can make it hard to access the online classes. And some students might not have a quiet place to work, so they might get distracted easily. 😔

Despite these challenges, I still think that online classes are a great solution for students who need extra help. It's like, you can get the one-on-one attention you need from a teacher, without having to leave your house! 🏠 And, you can do it at a time that's convenient for you, so you don't have to worry about missing out on other things. 🕒

In conclusion, online classes are a great way for students who need extra help to get the support they need. With access to a teacher's help, the ability to work at your own pace, and the convenience of doing it from home, online classes are definitely worth considering! 📚👍

Oh, and one more thing! Online classes can",1,llama2_chat,1
"Many students have expressed that projects should not be given over summer break. Students feel they should not have to do work during their summer break, Just as much as teachers shouldnt not have to grade papers over their summer break, If summer projects must be assigned they should be student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because the students would know how to complete the assignment, they would also find more interest, and more then likely the project would be completed with effort.

Over the summer most students are sent home with no instruction or contact availability. Students would attempt to do the assignment with no teacher guidance or help from others. With out the proper help the project could be completed wrong and completed with out any effort. When attempting to do my own summer project I stumbled into a problem and had no way to correct the problem, If summer projects were student made there are no excuses for not understanding how to complete the work.

Every student has a least favorite class, many would complain about a summer project from a boring or hard class. More students are likely to complete something that is more appealing to them personally. For example art is a more appealing subject to one, while someone else could be interested in history. Making your own project could be more intriguing which will make someone want to actually do the assignment they have created.

Majority of high school student do not complete their summer project. When a student completes the work it is more for the grade then personal gain. With the option to have students create their own projects brings creativity, interest, and effort. Many individuals put more effort into their own creations like art, putting more effort will cause more learning for the students personal gain, and the projects would be done nicely.

Many schools require summer projects to be completed. These projects would be more beneficial if students were able to create their own assignment. The idea of student designed projects are more beneficial because students would know how to complete the work, they would find more interest, and the project would be completed with more effort put into it. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Senator,

Its official, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, ans irrational.  A direct election would make it fair to most states and it wouldnt matter on the amount of electors.

The electoral college depends on the popular vote so the you are only voting for the electors not the actual canidates if you think about it.  Each states gets a certain amount of electors depending on the population of that state.  For example,

California gets 55 electors while Florida only gets 29.  So the presidents wont eben care to show up to places Alabama with only 9 electors.  They would only go to the bigger populated states and try and win their votes and not worry about the rest of the country.

If we had a direct election more of the people vote would count and it wouldnt matter about the electors in the states.  The citizens would actually be voting on the canidates.  This is a much more fair system to include everyone into and have an accurate election.

In the end, you should realize how uneccessary the electoral college is and how the direct election is a more fair way to get accurate results.  This way we would have much less issues and the elections would take place in all states and not just the ones with more electors.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

There has been a lot of controversy on weather to require all children of SCHOOL_NAME to perform community service and although this would be good in some ways this would be worse for many reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home.

My first reason is that forcing children to work on community service is that it takes time away from extra curricular activities. It's a common known fact that America has problems with obesity. Making kids do community service would definitely take time off of children's clock that they could be doing active activities like working out or playing a sport. This would increase obesity rates in America even more, causing the life span of children in this Country to shrink.

My second point is that forcing children to do community service makes it seem more like work, rather than if you didn't it would seem like something you do for fun, like a hobby. Community service is something that should be done because kids want to help other kids, the environment or those who need help. This wouldn't only make the amount of work done plummet, but also the quality of the work. If a kid is performing community service and is really enjoying himself, he is much more likely going to get a lot done and it is going to be very good quality work.

My third, and final point is that forcing children to perform community service is taking time away from children's school work or studying at home. There is no doubt that children in this very room that I'm writing this paper in are struggling to pass the 8th grade. Forcing them to do community service would only increase the number of failing students at SCHOOL_NAME. This would not only be problematic for the children that are failing, but would also hurt this schools' reputation of having good academic program.

In conclusion forcing children to perform community service would be problematic for three reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME, my name is STUDENT_NAME

not all student show be required o do community service. First of all is because some student don't have time to do community service. Second of all community service is a personnel choice you don't have to do it unless you get in trouble with the law and they make you do it. Third of all why would you even make student do community service if they don't want to ?

Some student cant even do community's service because they don't have the time. Some student play sports out side of school. Some kids have family problems at home and have to resolve those and don't have time for community service. There are also student that have homework or that are studying or getting extra help from a tutor because they don't get a certain subject.

Student also have a choice to do community service you cant force a student to do work. The only way you can do that is if they get in trouble at school or with the law. And if you were to force students to do community service a lot of student would leave your school and go to another where they can just learn and be with friends and not do community service. Now there will be some student that will volunteer because maybe they have extra time on there hands and are bored and figure why no help out but you can not force anybody to do community service.

I also have a question, why would you try to make students do community service? There already at school 5 days out of the week and do homework everyday and a lot of student play sports. So not a lot of student would have time to do this. that is why you should not make student do community service it should be a personal choice.      ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I feel like the presidential election should be decided by popular vote. This way seems easier to handle and simplier. The electoral college is to complex for some people and the popular vote is easier to count and manage. The popular vote is the best way to decide the presidential election because it shows what the people want and you dont want a not liked president. A not liked president could be bad for the economy and it could possibly cause havoc and chaos.

The electoral college is to complex and unfair. The presidential election should be based on who the people like and vote for not a state of electors. The electoral college is unfair because the candidate that most people want to be president might not win because of the state of electors who could betray the presidential candidate and vote for a diffrent presidential candidate.

"Online classes, also known as cyber school or virtual school, have become a popular option for high school students in recent years. While some students thrive in this environment, others struggle to find the same level of engagement and academic rigor as traditional brick-and-mortar schools. In this essay, I will explore whether online classes offer an appropriate educational experience for high school students.

On the one hand, online classes offer several benefits for high school students. For example, students can take classes from the comfort of their own homes, which can be especially helpful for those who have busy schedules or who live far away from their school. This flexibility can also be beneficial for students who have difficulty with traditional school schedules due to health issues or other personal circumstances. Additionally, online classes can provide students with access to a wider range of courses and resources than what may be available at their traditional school.

On the other hand, there are several drawbacks to online classes. For instance, students may struggle with the lack of face-to-face interaction with their teachers and peers. This can make it more difficult for students to build relationships and get the support they need to succeed academically. Additionally, online classes may not provide the same level of structure and accountability as traditional school, which can lead to students falling behind or not completing their work.

In my opinion, online classes can be a good option for some high school students, but they are not appropriate for everyone. Students who are self-motivated and disciplined, and who have a good support system at home, may find online classes to be a good fit. However, students who struggle with organization and time management, or who rely heavily on face-to-face interaction with their teachers and peers, may find online classes to be less effective.

In conclusion, while online classes can offer some benefits for high school students, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Students and parents should carefully consider the pros and cons of online classes before making a decision. Ultimately, the most important thing is for students to find an educational environment that works best for them and allows them to reach their full potential.",1,llama2_chat,0
"Having a positive attitude is often touted as the key to success. It may seem like a simple idea – having a positive outlook on life can help you achieve your goals and be successful. But the truth is that having a positive attitude has a much deeper significance and can lead to real success in many aspects of life. 

Studies have shown that those with a positive attitude tend to be more likely to take action towards achieving their goals, and this action is what leads to real success. For instance, a positive attitude can encourage an individual to put in more effort into succeeding in their career or education, because they believe that their goals are achievable. This can result in better career opportunities or higher grades. A positive attitude can also provide individuals with more self-confidence and belief in their abilities, which can spur them on to greater achievements. 

Furthermore, having a positive attitude can be beneficial to other areas of life too, such as relationships. By having an upbeat view on life, individuals can blaze paths to new friendships, find romance, or even strengthen existing connections. In this way, success is not just found in career terms, but also in personal connections.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude can lead to real success in more than just career terms. Positive thinking encourages individuals to take action towards their goals, and it strengthens their belief in their abilities and relationships. It is clear that having a positive attitude can open doors to greater achievements and a more fulfilled life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"The Electoral College has made everything easier on people. They keep votes fair, clear and concise and make them uncomplicated. Although there are some against the idea, the benifits outweigh the detriments immensly.

Bradford Plumer author of ""

The Indefensible Electoral College

"" insists that ""the electoral college is unfair to voters""(source 2 paragraph 13). This is surely an opinion as he is just trying to deride the Electoral College. However majority of states vote in favor of the Electoral College anyway. It gives a simple vote to people and produces a clear winner. Also he states that ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.""(p.12) He thinks that one representitive cant speak for his region, but thats why they vote right? He represents the majority supplimenting a clear representation of his state/region.

Also Collumist Richard Posner implies that the Electoral College has ""a presidential canidate [that has] trans-regional appeal"" (Source 3 paragraph 19). So the presidential cannidate can be based off a full region or more, not just a few states. This makes the vote obvious and is a more fair vote. Also the Office of Federal Register tells us there are 538 electors with a 270 majority int the Electoral College(Source 1 paragraph 3). Not only is there great variety present but with many votes they make the result concise.

Not only is the Electoral College making votes concise and fair, also it is currently working. Bradford Plumer states ""The electoral college is...outdated""(Source 2 paragraph 14). How can it be so obsolete if it is presently working out. The Electoral College is giving the vote meaning and depth in that it gives voters the choice of president and his electors. The Office of the Fedral Register informs us ""You help choose you state's electors when you vote for your president""(Source 1 paragraph 6). This gives the voters more voting power as the get to help choose other things in goverment.

Even though there are many counter-claims, the benifits surely outweigh the detriments. Its nearly a perfect system. The fair, multifarious choices, and clear voting of the Electoral college proves it deserves it's stay in the goverment.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"As an eighth-grade student, I have heard the quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson that “Without failure, you won’t succeed in life” many times. This statement has been widely discussed among people, and it is often used to motivate individuals to take risks and embrace failures. However, in this essay, I will analyze the accuracy of this statement and evaluate both the points that agree and disagree with it.

On the one hand, Emerson’s quote is accurate in the sense that failure is an essential part of life. People often learn from their failures, and they can use the lessons they have learned to improve themselves. For instance, when I failed my math test last week, I realized that I needed to study more and practice more problems. As a result, I spent more time studying and practicing, and I improved my grades significantly. Similarly, when entrepreneurs fail in their businesses, they can use the lessons they have learned to start new businesses or improve their existing ones.

On the other hand, Emerson’s quote is not entirely accurate because not all failures are equal. Some failures are due to circumstances beyond our control, such as economic downturns or natural disasters. In such cases, individuals cannot be blamed for their failures, and they should not be discouraged from trying again. Furthermore, some failures are due to lack of effort or poor decision-making, and individuals should learn from these failures and improve themselves.

In conclusion, Emerson’s quote that “Without failure, you won’t succeed in life” is partially accurate. While failure is an essential part of life, not all failures are equal, and individuals should learn from their failures and improve themselves. As an eighth-grade student, I believe that individuals should embrace failures and use them as opportunities to learn and grow. However, they should also recognize that some failures are beyond their control and should not be discouraged from trying again.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Many people still believe that the Face on Mars is created by aliens. Some say it's to hard to really know what the object really is. Although many people disbelieve this is not a face, there is many places out west that look like this, and the cameras we used for this mission are to clear, and catch the smallest details, to be counted as incorrect. I believe that the Face, is only a landmark.

Based on the story, Unmasking the Face on Mars, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" When this picture was showed to the world, many people thought it looked like a face, just like many scientst. but the people from NASA called it a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head..."" formed by shadows, giving it an ilusion of a face. Many people still doubted this, and wanted to believe it was a face. I can see how it looks like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but just because it looks like somthing, it doesn't mean it is that.

Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it looks like a person, or alien, but many things look like something else, and it doesn't mean thats what they are, because of looks. The story, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west."" So based on this sentence, it could be a formation like out west. it has the same height as one in Idaho. It could have a different face then ones on Earth, but I highly doubt it is an alien.

The first, and second image on Mars look like faces, and appear to have all the needs to be a face. The second image wasn't really clear, and many people are right. Some people say, ""the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April '98-a cloudy time of yer on the Red Planet. Perhaps alien marking were hidden by haze."" This could be true. I do believe that if there was anything little, or hard to see, it couldn't be found when it was really cloudy outside, and the picture wasn't taken clearly.

Even though you couldn't see what was there, on the second picture, we did take another one. I do believe that some things could have been hidden, but they would have been found, with the third picture. Based on the text, ""if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" you would be able to see anything. So there was nothing there. the only thing that was there, ws a land formation, just like Earth has. We weren't able to find anything that would make the formation, considered to be some type of alien creation.

Based on research, and facts from, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" I believe that the Face, was actually just a land formation. For those who believe it was an alien, then you might be right, but from evidence, I think that it is just a cool and unique formation. The first images were unclear, to tell, but the thir image, was very clear, and us people from NASA, discovered that it wasn't an alien, but just a formation, like a butte or mesa. The Face, had shadows that made it look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but it actually wasn't. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principal,

Helping others and our community is a very important matter, but some of the people I associate with disagree. Should they be required to perform community service, or not? I believe that benefiting others by providing a service to the community is a great and honorable achievement. All students at our school should be doing community service and benefiting society.

To further explain my opinion, I will provide an example. My friend does not think that he should pick up any litter that is not his that is on the ground. While my other friend cannot stop picking up the smallest bit of trash in her gated community. She is providing a service to her community and the animals and insects that live in her area. It is important for those animals not to eat or consume any of the litter left on the ground we walk on. Therefore, it is important to those animals to stay alive and be healthy because she picks up the trash and disposes of it in the proper way.

To conclude, community service at our school would benefit students and prevent a dirty campus, tripping, and lazy students. If every student in our school had as much determination, persistence, and concern as my friend, our school would be a great learning environment. Thank you for your consideration.

"Ever since World War II our development has been centered on the car, now people are questioning if whether or not we have gone in the correct direction. With many people coming to a realization that private transportation may not be the best option for travel, it is hard to deny. There are already developed places in the world experimenting with the abscence of cars in their society.

Vauban, Germany is one of those places. Vauban residents have undertaken the task of turning their streets completely car-free, and it's working. The residents of the district even claim to enjoy a community without automobiles more, people claim to be less tense and happier without owning a car. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, those who do live in areas dedicated to large garages at the edge of the development that car owners but for $40,000, along with a home. While efforts in the past to making cities denser have given people a better reason to walk, it hasn't gone away at all, people are still driving everywhere they go. In the United States car reduced communities are being promoted by the Enviornmental Protecetion Agency, and legislators are starting to act on this. Public transport serving suburbs will play a much larger role in a new federal transportation bill being approved this year.

Vauban is not the only place with that has experimenting with banning private transportation, Paris has banned driving due to smog after days of near-record pollution to clear the air of the city. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, one of the most poluted cities in the world. People blamed diesel fuel because of a French tax policy favors diesel over gasoline, diesel makes up 67 percent of cehicles in France. Paris has more smog than other European capitals, many companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions were made to allown plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was also free of charge Friday to Monday. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ban on odd-numbered plates to be lifted.

Bogota, Columbia is also doing their part in attempting to reduce the amount of automobiles used in society, car-free day has been in effect for three years in Bogota. With a large turnout, the streets were free of traffic jams as millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, and took buses to work. People comment how it is a great opportunity to redice stress and air polution in Columbia. Municipal authorities from other countries travel to Bogota to see the event, and they believe it to be a revolutionary change. Since the day without cats was implemented into an improvement camapign that began in the mid-1990's, 118 miles of bicycle path has been constructed in Columbia.

In the United States, we are being affected by these other countries choices to give up air pollution for a less stressful and tense life. Recent studies suggest a decrease in the amount of cars being bought by Americans, as well as the amount of people getting lisceces. Not buying cars are helping Americans with their finances and improving their health. Sociologists believe that if this pattern persists it will benefit the American public and enviornment greatly.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Attending classes from home online or by video conference has many potential benefits. For example, it eliminates the need for students to physically attend a class on campus, saving time and money associated with traveling and living on campus. It also gives students more flexibility, as lectures and course materials can be accessed and reviewed at any time, rather than conforming to the constraints imposed by physical class schedules. 

However, online or video conference classes come with some limitations. For one, it can be more difficult to stay engaged and attentive when classes are held in a non-traditional environment. Additionally, students may find it more difficult to connect and collaborate with peers, as there is no face-to-face interaction.

Overall, I believe that classes from home online or by video conference should be available for all students.

I want to bring your attention to making students do community service. community service will teach the students how to be responsible, because they will have to be responsible for doing their community service, it will keep them out of trouble, because they have something else to do besides go to friends houses, and party, and they have something them, and their family can be proud of because they made their own decision to help the community.

For example, the students will have to be on time to their community service job and that will help them to be on time to other things in life. They will also have to be responsible and make sure they help the community, and not forget to do their job, which is like a normal kid doing homework in school. The student has to do their home work, and they can not forget. I think that community service will help them to also be more independent, because they have to do their own duty of something like picking up trash on school property, and they will not be able to have help because it is their own job. At home I am responsible for taking out the trash. That is my responsibility, even though it is the family trash. I take out the trash whenever it needs to be taken out, and I do not even get paid, just like a community service job. I do not always want to take out the trash but with community service, it shows me how if I am responsible I am not only helping myself, but the environment, and the people around me.

Community service will also keep children out of trouble. Some students these days go to party's, and get grounded for several reasons. However, with community service the students will have something to do on their spare time which will lead to not getting in trouble, or being somewhere there not supposed to be. The students will have to be do the community service, but instead of being somewhere their parents can not contact them, they will be building a garden for a school, or helping little kids learn to read, Doesn't that sound better to you? If the students are feeling stressed out they know that they can attend to their community service job instead of doing something bad just to get the stress away. Of course the students could do a community service job with their friends, but the point is that they will be safe and doing something good for the community.

Have you ever wanted to be the only subject at the diner table? The one your parents want to brag about to their friends? Well, I know I do. If you make the students do community service, their family would be so proud of them for stepping up and helping out. Maybe some kids do not do sports, so their parents do not have something to cheer at every weekend, but If a student came home to their family telling them how good they felt about doing community service that weekend, then the parents have something very special to cheer for. Parents of students want their children to do good in school, and if you consider making community service part of your school , then I am sure that you will be getting calls from parents saying thank-you for making my children do community service I am so proud and it has helped them so much. I know that if I helped out the community not only my parents would be proud, but I would be more than proud of myself.

Keep in mind that Some of my friends have already started doing community service on their own, like tutoring elementary school children, and picking up liter on the streets, they told me that it has helped them so much,a nd I would like to be li Therefore, if you could get everyone in the school to do that then Don't forget it would make everyone have so much more responsibility, as well as they would stay out of trouble, and their family and them would be so proud.

I think that it will change student is the most spectacular way, and I hope that you agree as well.

"Dear Mr Sentor Of Flordia.

The land of the free, the beauty, and streets paved with gold. Thats what people think of this amazing country. The Systems we have here works even know we get insults from around that world. USA changed the world. Back a long time ago back when the application mountains was the border, this land was govered wrongly. It was a long and painful war, alot of blood was spilled, alot of tears were shed. but our for fathers founded this counrty right. Since then changes were made in our laws that helped this courty, but we should never change this goverment.

"As an 8th grader, I believe that finishing high school in three years instead of the traditional four years could have both positive and negative effects. Some students may benefit from entering college and starting their careers early, while others may struggle with the increased workload and lack of social interaction.

On the one hand, finishing high school in three years could allow students to start their college careers earlier, giving them a head start on their future careers. This could be especially beneficial for students who know exactly what they want to study and want to get a jumpstart on their education. According to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, students who attend college full-time are more likely to graduate than those who attend part-time. By finishing high school early, students could have more time to focus on their college studies and potentially graduate earlier than their peers.

On the other hand, finishing high school in three years could also lead to a lack of social interaction and a more intense academic workload. High school is not just about academics; it's also a time for students to make friends, learn social skills, and develop their personalities. By finishing high school early, students may miss out on these important experiences and feel disconnected from their peers. Additionally, the increased academic workload could be overwhelming for some students, leading to stress and burnout.

In El Salvador, where I live, there are already some schools that offer a three-year high school program. According to a report by the World Bank, these schools have seen improved graduation rates and increased college enrollment. However, there are also concerns about the lack of social interaction and the potential for increased dropout rates among students who finish high school early.

In my opinion, the decision to finish high school in three years should be left up to the individual student and their family. Some students may thrive in an accelerated environment, while others may struggle. It's important for schools to provide support and resources for students who choose to finish high school early, including additional academic support and opportunities for socialization.

In conclusion, while there are both pros and cons to finishing high school in three years, I believe that it's important for schools to provide students with the option to do so. By giving students the ability to choose their own path, schools can help them reach their",1,llama2_chat,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I have seen firsthand the pros and cons of allowing students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time. While some argue that students should be allowed to have phones during lunchtime and other free time as long as they turn them off while learning, others argue that this policy is harmful to students' education and social skills. In this essay, I will analyze the arguments for and against this idea and argue that the principal should not allow students to bring cell phones to school.

On one hand, proponents of allowing students to bring cell phones to school argue that it can improve communication between students and parents, increase safety, and provide students with access to educational resources. For example, if a student forgets their lunch or needs to communicate with their parents during the day, having a cell phone can be helpful. Additionally, some argue that cell phones can be used as educational tools, such as for research or learning new skills.

On the other hand, opponents of allowing students to bring cell phones to school argue that it can be distracting to students during class, disrupt classroom dynamics, and decrease students' social skills. For example, if students are constantly checking their phones during class, they may not be fully engaged in the lesson and may miss important information. Additionally, some argue that cell phones can create a divide between students who have them and those who do not, leading to social isolation for some students.

In my opinion, the benefits of allowing students to bring cell phones to school do not outweigh the potential drawbacks. While communication between students and parents can be improved, this benefit is outweighed by the potential for distraction and social isolation. Additionally, while cell phones can be used as educational tools, they can also be used for non-educational purposes, such as social media and gaming, which can be detrimental to students' academic performance.

Furthermore, allowing students to bring cell phones to school can set a dangerous precedent. If students are allowed to bring cell phones to school, it may be difficult to enforce rules about other electronic devices, such as tablets or laptops. This could lead to a situation where students are constantly using electronic devices during class, making it difficult for teachers to maintain order and focus on teaching.

In conclusion, while the idea of allowing students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"How many times a day do you think you send a text message? Think about that then think about the messages that you sent that actually matter. In my opinion I think students should be able to use their cell phones during lunch or free time because it could be an emergency. and you might throw that statement against me by saying that it's nothing the school can't handle but it could very well be a private matter the student is embarrassed about.

Sometimes students are scared of sharing private things with adults in school thus they have a cell phone to contact a parent of legal guardian to help them with whatever has gone wrong. My point isn't that every time you pick up your cell phone to contact an adult it means it's an emergency; my point is that everyone deserves their privacy without an adult at school's help.

I understand and am fully aware that students may abuse these privileges for their own entertainment and pleasure however adults are still in charge and have every right to rid the student of their cell phone. Personally I don't care about using my cell phone in school unless it's a rare occasion in which I would like to contact a parent. I do not need to text my friends while I am at school because I know I will see them later and they're probably in the next classroom over anyways.

Another reason why I would want to have a cell phone privilege during lunch and/or free time is because of transportation purposes. For example, my sister recently got her drivers licence and now drives me to school every morning but I am never sure if she will be there to pick me up after school. Or even if a student has an appointment and it got canceled they would needed to contact a parent. Here at SCHOOL_NAME

we use notes to get a message from a parent to a student; but there are kids running the notes so we don't always receive them.

In conclusion I understand why you wouldn't want students to have such privileges because there's always the one goof ball who has to mess it up for everyone else but you have to understand my point too. There could be a private emergency or maybe a transportation difficulty. What I really want to say is let kids have their cell phones when they need them and take them away when they don't. I only hope you understand my thoughts and reasonings and I appreciate your time.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The ""Face on Mars"" was just a natural landforms. All of the planets have natural land forms. If there really was civilization on mars we would probably already know about it. But contrary to what NASA believes there are were other people who said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by haze.

NASA thinks that it would have been important to tell tax-payers if it were to have been a true alien land mark, but since you did not recieve any information; you can assume it was just a natural landform. If there were to have been a sign of life on that planet (Mars) it would benefit NASA and the whole world would probably know. ""The face"" is located on the part if Mars called ""Cydonia"" which according to Jim Garvin ""Is not easy to target (paragraph 9).""

Mission controllers are preparing to go back and look again so they can try to prove that NASA is not trying to hide any evidence. It will not be easy. Mostly because we don't pass over the face very often. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.

In conclusion, NASA is very sure that ""The Face on Mars"" is just an illusion and not bona fide evidence of life on Mars. In the future we hope to discover that it really is just a natural landform and not bona fide evidence on Mars.

"Cars that can drive themselves?

Is a driverless car really a good idea? Manufacturing a driverless car has not even been a succeding task. Cars that can drive on their own still require an alert driver at times. If the self driving car was manufactured laws would have to be changed, the company and the owner would have issues if a crash did accure, and the owner possibly needed to be alert may not stay alert. The self driving car needs more time before being tried out with actual costumers.

The driverless car manufactured by google has made it half a million miles without a crash. However drivers still are alerted to take over the wheel when parking, navigating traffic, or road construction. What could happen if a ""driverless"" car alerted the owner but they weren't alert and did't take they wheel in time? Major accidents could be caused from this. A driver not focused on the road could put in danger themselves and other drivers around them.

If the driver was'nt alert and an accident did accure, both the company and owner would be in seriouse trouble. Certian laws would have to be made or changed to solve this issue. If there was a crash with two cars would one of the drivers be of blame as they are now or would both companies be blamed. Technology has instences when it doesn't work. Everyone has yelled at a phone or T.V before. Though when that technology doesn't work properly it's not a life or death situatiuon. Also how expensive would this be? It's well known how expensive a phone, T.V, or new computer can be. It would be too expensive to make them the sale price would have to bring back the money spent to manufacture one and the sales person would need money to actually make for the work. How many people could ctually afford it. The people it would help most likely can't even come up with the money to get one.

With the rate of accidents now drivers barely stay alert when they have the wheel. But knowing, or thinking, they have the freedom to do as they please while the car drives itself they will lose focus. Drivers won't pay attention to the road. People have way to much trust in their technology they wont even think of what would happen when they have to drive. How owuld they react if they tried to take a nap and was awaken to take the wheel? they may not have enough time to even think of what they need to do to avoid an accident.

What would be the point of a driverless car? Reduce the number of drunk drivers on the road maybe. Or give people who can't drive the transportation they need without public transports. This would all be great! But what would happen when the car needed them to take over. Of course you'd still need to go through training and so on to get your liscnes so people who have the inability to drive may it be physical will have no prevail in it. Also if a drunk driver was alerted they would still be driving after drinking. The only ones that coul use this technology are the ones that can already drive. Then what is the point of the driverless car anyway? There's too many saftey dangers and pointless reasons to start manufacturing a driverless car.            ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Your friend's advice is helpful, but others can be too! It doesn't hurt to hear different thoughts from people. The more advice you have is better. Seeing that others have succeeded is people great to ask! You can make good choices than ever and be successful too. Seeking for multiple opinions is helpful because it can show stronger opinions, you can have multiple ideas, and find new advice.

Since you are hearing more than one opinion, you can see which option would be stronger. People may have shared the same ideas, but that can mean that others are using the same advice a lot too. It's probably the most helpful to use! Usually the more people that follow the advice, you can know that it's trustworthy. For example, I have a lot of friends that shared the same advice to me. My friends all have succeeded well. I now know the advice that they've given me is helpful, since they all were successful. Hearing same ideas from people can be a strong opinion that is useful.

Having more ideas is helpful. The less ideas you have, you can run out of thoughts easily. Running out of advice to use can lead your mind blank. You won't be able to focus well, due to you trying to think of a new idea. Let's say someone gave you an advice that isn't helpful. Well, you have plenty to follow if you had lots of advice given. The more advice you have, is better since you have many ideas on your head. You will be less able to lose your track of thoughts.

You can find new advice. You never head of it, but it's always good to try something new. Most of the times, new advice can be helpful. You can share the advice to others for them to follow. If it lead you to success, it can lead them too! It starts a repeating cycle of people sharing new advice to each other. I was once given an advice that no one else ever told me. I stated using the advice and I did well! I recommended it to others, and they did just as good as I did. Give it a try! Something that others didn't share, doesn't mean the person's advice for you is useless. It could be the most helpful advice given to you!

Hearing multiple opinions from each other is useful because it can show stronger opinions, having more than one idea, and you can find new helpful advice. It really helps for you to hear different perspectives from everyone. It shows what can lead them to success. The advice they gave you can end up you being successful too!

"I am Luke Bomberger. I am a Seagoing Cowboy. This is a United Nations program to bring aid to European countries unable to provide for themselves after the war. We take care of the animals being sent overseas while they are on the boats. Our jobs are to feed and water the animals, bring the food up from below deck, and clean the animal's stalls. I know this sounds like a boring job that's all work, but there are many reasons why this job is so fun.

The first reason is because while you are in the countries you are visiting, you get to go sightseeing. I saw things like the Panama Canal, the Acropolis, and an excavated castle. I also got to ride a gondola in Venice. You may be able to see such famous landmarks as the Eifle Tower, or the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Oh, and did I forget to mention that you get paid for that? If you have always wanted to travel, then this job just might be for you.

Another reason is because you get to slack off on the return trip. On the trip home, you have dropped off all the animals, so you no longer have a job to do. This means you have free time to do whatever you want. When I was on return trips, we would start up baseball games in the rooms where the animals used to be kept. Other times, someone would bring a deck of cards, and we would spend hours just playing poker. Once, we even had a table-tennis tournament.

This is certainly a fun and exciting job. On a more serious note, this job can make you more aware of other peoples problems. There are many troubled countries across the world.

"""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be imited by by dangers and doubts but should expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This quote is by the author who is suggesting that studying Venus is worthy of pursuit despite the dangers it presents. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" tells you about the risks of traveling to Venus, but how the exploration has value. The author could scare some readers instead of supporting his idea that Venus should be explored. The author does not support his idea well enough for people to be convinced that Venus should be explored despite the risks.

Venus has many challenges and dangerous characteristics, too dangerous for humans to travel and explore. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets, and clouds of ""highly corrosive sulfuric acid."" The author states all these facts about Venus, and all of them describe a planet that is too dangerous to be explored. The author is not ""supporting"" his idea when stating these things, but he does support it when he states that Venus is the most ""Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" because he is trying to get readers excited about exploring Venus. The author does not say these ideas enough for readers to find visiting Venus worthy.

The author suggests alternatives for traveling to the solar system, like hovering Venus, but these conditions are still dangerous to humans. We would only get limited insight if we did trial this idea. Also, researchers could not get samples of anything from the planet. The author also states that NASA is looking for other approaches like mechanical computers in the 1800s and 1940s, but the author also states that these computer may not be able to withstand the physical conditions of Venus. The author states these alternatives, but all of them have a down side that would not give enough information to the researchers.

The author does not give enough information about why we should take the risk of studying Venus. The author states many good insights about how our planet Earth and Venus are ""twins"", and how Venus has enough value to explore it. As readers, we see only the disadvantages the author states. For example, how hot Venus is, and how no human could possibly live if they went on the surface. Not only does the author state dangerous facts about Venus, he also states alternatives about how researchers could maybe find information about the planet. These altenatives however, don't satisfy what we want to figure out about Venus. If we sent people to hover safely above the planet, then we would only get limited insight.

"Dear Principle,

I believe that all students should be given the privilege of being able to use their phones during lunch. As long as we do not use them during the day and turned them off it would be no distraction the class or the teacher trying to teach it. This should be a good policy because it would not be distracting, it is a good way of talking to our friends, and it would get rid of the need to move table to table to talk to all of your friends.

Cell phones would not be distracting during lunch because the lunch room is loud enough as it is, it would not disturb anyone. You cannot distract anyone lunch because they are talking to their own friends and not paying attention to anyone else.

Furthermore, the only thing to do at lunch is eat and socialize with your friends and that what you would be doing when texting. It is the same thing.

Furthermore, cell phones should be allowed at lunch because it is a more efficient and convenient way of talking to our friends. This would decrease the unnecessary yelling and overall loudness of the room. Therefore, making it easier on the staff, lunch ladies, and student.

Lastly, cell phones would be a good thing for us and everyone during lunch. because it would get rid of having to go back and forth from tables to talk with your peers. Most lunch staff find this annoying for reasons i do not know, but if we were capable of texting each other we would have no reason or excuse to do this.

Cell phones during the day would be a serious distraction to everyone in a learning environment because of the ringing, buzzing, and irritating sound of your fingers typing in words.

"Dear Principal,

In the cogently stated quote, Abraham Lincoln rendered ""A house divided against itself can not stand"". To clarify, people against each other will never accomplish anything. Together, people can do a lot more than just one persistent person can ever do. when people are against each other it can cause a lot of chaos and can even make things worse than it was in the beginning. Amazingly, participating in activities ,like community service, can bring people together and even make them stronger than before. Getting college credits, teaching responsibility, and helping the planet are some reasons community service should be mandatory.

To commence, it should be required for students to do community service because it helps them get college credits. Surprisingly, when colleges look at applications they notice things like community service hours. Making it mandatory can help students chances of them getting into the college of their choice. If one loves animals they can do community service in a animal shelter; they can enjoy the work and still get credits out of it, so everyone wins. If someone likes children they can work at an orphanage doing simple things like putting kids in a ruby red bed or taking care of feeding them. Clearly, enjoying a job while getting college credits can really help one's future.

Furthermore, Community service teaches students about responsibility. one must be responsible to take care of a puppy or a baby. Usually, if someone doesn't have responsibility starting in community service, they have it when they are finished with it. ratiocinat",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Most people think that all you do is work, like taking care of animals. However, there are ways for you to have fun while working. You can play games, read a book, or even see cool sights. Here are a couple of things you could do.

First of all, you can see many different sights and explore while traveling. I know that I have visited some really cool places, like seeing an excavated castle in Crete. You can also see many different things. You could see the beautiful, wavy water or see a beautiful sunset while you travel. Another place I think you should visit is the Panama Canal. So, if you ever get bored and don't anything else to do, you should some beautiful sights and marvelous places. You may never know what you see and even make new friends along the way.

Second of all, you could play games if you get bored. The Seagoing Cowboys program isn't just all about working for animals. It's about having fun and playing games. For example, I know when I joined the Seagoing Cowboys, we would play games, like table tennis, baseball, and even volleyball. You could also read too, if you would like. Where would you play these games, you ask? Back then, we would play in the empty holes where the animals have been housed.

Third of all, you could just have fun. You could read a book, play games, or even relax. Talk to the animals while you take care of them. If all you do is work and no fun, then you are going to not like being part of the Seagoing Cowboys. I remember when I did do a lot of fun stuff, but I had to do work first. I would like to tell you a very good story. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I fell down the steps, but luckily I made it okay. I just couldn't work a couple of days because

I had cracked ribs. Trust me on this point. If you say to people that you had a great time, they would probably want to join too.

In conclusion, I made very good and understanding points. First, go visit some sights and places while you explore. Not only could you explore new worlds, but you could also meet new people and try out different languages. Second of all, you could play games. If you play games like volleyball and baseball, you will be more happier when you play games that if you just do work all the time and not have any fun. You will get bored and most likely not enjoy yourself all that much. Third of all, have fun. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for these reasons.

"Dear senator,

The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational as Bradford Plumber stated. First of all, The electoral college consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vise President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. We should abolish the electoral college because it is unfair to voters. It's all because of the winner-take-all system that in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. They focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all - 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

One of the best arguments against the electoral college is the disaster factor. The state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960, segragationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This means that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to him.

Another issue that most people worry about is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If that happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives and the Senate would choose Vise President.

To say the least, abolishing the electoral college is the best idea. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, I am not alone. The Gallup poll was taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. How does the electoral college even have any defenderes left? Even in a close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism and I couldn't agree more. It is a thing from the past and should stay that way. The electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense because it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. Richard A. Posner even says that when you vote for a presidential candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Summer is a time away from the stresses of school, the chaos of getting assignments in before the deadline, and a chance to catch up on the little to no sleep we've gotten. But remember that feeling of sitting in a desk after two or three months, not remembering the proper way to hold a pencil or how to speak a language you spoke in all of last year? Although it is a pain to be thinking about school and grades over the summer, doing some summer projects to keep our minds in check is not the worst idea in the world. However, the question of whether a summer project should be teacher-designed verses student-designed, I believe, has an enormous impact on the effectiveness and quality of the project itself. Based on personal experiences, summer projects should be student-designed to improve the quality, effectiveness, and to allow the project to be more enjoyable overall.

The idea is simple, it is a known fact that when a student likes what they are reading or learning, they are more motivated to do it. For my fourth grade summer project, my teacher assigned us all the same book and told to complete a plot analysis through either a paper or a plot diagram. I read this book the weekend before school started and wrote my plot analysis the night before. Looking back at it, I understand why fourth grade me put it off to the last second. Even eleventh grade me would put a project like that off to the last second. I wasn't given a choice. I had no freedom. Not even a little wiggle room to be creative. The quality of that project was very poorly done. I had no motivation to put even half of my effort into it because my number one goal was to get the project over with and finish it before the deadline.

However, my sixth grade summer project was very different. Our teacher allowed us to pick a book from a list and gave us some guidelines on a project we had to complete, but left the ends very loose so that we could choose what we did and how it was done. I chose to create a book trailer which soon became one of my favorite projects. I was so excited that I would work on it a little bit every day because I cared so much about the outcome. When I sent my project to my teacher, he sent me an email about how he was impressed with the amount of work and dedication I had put into a simple summer project.

To state the obvious, the quality, my attitude, and time management of my sixth grade summer project was very night and day when compared to my fourth grade project. It is more motivational to complete a project over the summer when it is something you enjoy. Whether that happens to be an essay or a book trailer, I strongly believe that students should be given the opportunity and freedom to make a project their own. For this can also help their new teacher get to know their students better for the new school year. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"As a society, it has become normal for kids to follow the same path every weekday that leads them firstly to school, and then back to home. Some schools are beginning to offer distance learning from home as an alternative to attending a physical school. This is unnecessary and could potentially be detrimental to students whom benefit from the physicality of school as it is now and could lead to unwanted effects. Schools should remain physical for many reasons, primary examples of why would likely be due to the organization that provides currently, and secondly because of the complications that online schooling creates.

Adapting to a new school system would be at the very minimum very dysfunctional to many students who have revolved their schedules around the physicality of current schooling. Both student and parent schedules have been built around what times they go to school and for many parents, a change to online school would provide struggle to return home everyday simply to tediously drive their children to their respective extracurricular activities they may have left after the shift to online school. A continuation of the current schooling method maintains this careful balance of how the students manage to attend their after-school events. This is also beneficial to parents whose work schedule may conflict with the schedule an online school would provide and for something as delicate as work hours, could mean having to face unemployment at the cost of switching schooling methods. Shifting an entire school's enrollment onto online school would also provide many students who already have difficulty with technological learning further stress and struggle.

Online school while in the end might be more fluid and simplistic than the current method of schooling, but online school would not be adapted without complication. The amount of children who already struggle with online testing and assignments is astronomically higher than the amount that struggle with physical paperwork and a shift to online school would only exacerbate that number. Online schooling creates complications that a normal school does not as for some children in lesser-fortunate areas, internet access isn't always an ability. Children plagued with unfortunate financial situations may not be able to pay the taxing amounts of money that internet companies demand in this technological age. This leads to some children being unfairly disadvantaged and prevented from holding the same opportunities as those with the ability to video call a private teacher. Online school creates a different learning environment, one which children of this current era, and parents of the eras prior, are both unequipped and unprepared for and would create adversity in finding the same strategies that were physically capable in modern school systems.

Online Schooling, while it may be beneficial to students with physical limitation or who need one-on-one assistance, would be nothing shy of disruptive, disorganized, and complicating to the systems currently in place. This being said, children should be equally able to attend schooling regardless of what form and for solely that reason, in necessity, Online school should be provided externally and not as a form of public education. Adopting a new method of schooling is non-assisting and should remain as an emergency protocol in wake of the impossibility of physical schools. Physical schools will be capable of providing schooling for generations to come and should remain as the primary method of public education.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I think we should have technology to read students emotional expressions. we could use this for classes when we are doing homework and we dont understand so the teacher could help.""can we actually ""calculate"" emotions -like math homework. If they could use it i think it would be better.

If we use this technology we could see if someone was hiding there emotions. If we used it we could help peoplethat need help. we could see if they are scared or confused or even angry. I would want to know if someone was mad so i wouldn't say something to them and make hem upset.

we could use this in paintings we could see what emotions they have. In this article they said Mona Lisa is 83% happy 9% disgusted 6% fearful 2% angry. I think it would help artist to make sure they look a surton emotion. I think we should have technology to read students emotional expressions because we could use this to do homework and teachers understand if we get the homework. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Tim Ryan, an experienced bird watcher once said, ""In middle school, somebody started the weirdest club imaginable... a bird watching club. Being the class clown that I was, my friends and I signed up for the oddest club at school. At first, it was just funny. Then I found myself looking forward to club day. Bird watching was a ton of fun. If I wasn't required to sign up for a club, I would never have found my true passion -- bird watching."" School required extracurricular activities have been controversial for many years. Is it a waste of time? Are the activities even fun? As the years went by, many people started to realize that extracurricular activities are beneficial. Students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities because it can boost their confidence, improve their time management skills, teach them how to work with other people, and they may even find a new favorite hobby.

One of the most obvious reasons why students should participate in an extracurricular activity is because they can find a new hobby. According to a survey conducted by the Activity Observation Committee, 76% of all Generic_City students have found a new, beloved activity that was introduced to them during school. Some people have the courage to attempt a new activity on their own time, but others aren't so lucky. You may think you don't like to do something, but you truly don't know until you try it. Your future won't be resting on that activity. If you like it, then that's amazing. If not, then there is nothing to worry about. You will have tried it and then your source of dislike would be valid.

In addition, participating in an extracurricular activity can boost confidence. Generic_Name, a sixth grader from Generic_School, once said, ""I never actually thought that I would be good at a sport. However, all of my friends are good at basketball. When club time rolled around at school, I got pressured into joining the basketball club with them. It turns out that times have changed. I'm pretty good at basketball. I've been feeling much better about myself knowing that I'm good at something."" By requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, Generic_Name found that she was really good at basketball. A talent could be hidden under your surface. By signing up for a club, it can unearth that special talent. Some students may acknowledge this but are too afraid to try something new. By requiring students to sign up for an activity, the have to take that risk.

Another benefit of participating in an extracurricular activity, is that you can improve your communication skills. Generic_Name is a part of his high school's student council. Part of his job is to work with others to cultivate ideas for school programs. The council has taught him the importance of expressing his opinions and ideas. The council has made Evan much more confident about his opinions and now expresses them throughout daily life. A student council is not the only activity that can boost your communication skills. Those skills will increase anywhere that you are working together, which is usually any activity. By improving your communication skills, you are preparing for the future. You will need to be able to have excellent communication skills during college, work, and just daily life. In addition, you could make many friends. According to the Brain Like Mindedness Observation Assessments, people with the same interests typically make better friends. A club is just a bunch of people gathered together doing an activity that they enjoy. There are plenty of chances to make a friend. So next time nobody wants to join a club with you, don't worry. Once you get there you will make many friends.

On the other hand, some people claim that extracurricular activities are just a waste of time. Generic_Name, a member of her high school's softball team stated that, ""I devoted my entire life to a single sport. It was a very bad choice. I had to quit my job and I've had many sleepless nights trying to do all of my homework. Although I love softball, I should have never made this commitment.""

The only way that participating in an extracurricular activity could be a waste of time is if you aren't managing your time efficiently. Participating in activities can teach you how and why it is important to manage your time. A study conducted by the Time Management Association showed that 87% of all students that are in extracurricular activities have started to use a calendar or agenda to plan their time. Using your time wisely can be very beneficial when you have many things to get done. It can also help with not procrastinating. By knowing what has to be done and when it has to be done, you are more likely to actually do that work. This will help you prepare for what will come in the future. Your whole life will need to be planned out: when to get groceries, what needs to be done at work, when to go to the dentist, or even when to pick up a child from school. Whatever the scenario is, it is crucial to manage your time wisely. Life can get chaotic and it is important to know how to handle the chaos.

Ultimately, participating in extracurricular activities is a very beneficial from a young age. These activities can boost confidence, teach people how to work together, and improve time management skills. So, next time you have the opportunity to try a new sport or activity, go for it! You have nothing to lose and a lot to gain. Suggest clubs and activities to friends and family members. It is important to involve not only yourself, but others too. Remember Tim, the professional bird watcher? If he had never took the risk of participating in the bird watching club at his school, he would never have been discovered his true passion of bird watching. Maybe one day you will be like Tim and participate in an extracurricular activity. You never know... it could shape your future for the better.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principle,

I believe you should be able to go and play sports if you maintain lower than a c. I believe you should because some of the teachers give us way to much homework like this one teacher she gives us a packet to do every day. Also i believe you should be able to play if you don't turn in your homework. or miss a day in practice because you are sick i really do believe if you get lower than a c grade average you should not be able to play also because some people just cant not get there grade up in science or math but its one thing if your failing a class and are trying you should be able to play if you are trying and getting help but still just don't get it.

So now you know that I believe you should be able to play in a sport if your grade is lower than an b I believe if you should be able to play no matter what the because if your grade is a c or higher. i think it should be the same.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I think its wrong to use the Facial Action Coding System on students in their classroom. One of the reason i think this way is becuase teachers should not have to use a machine is read their students emotions by simple just asking a student on how he or she feels can get the same results. Another reason is the money for a machine like this is very costy, and not every school could afford a machine like this. Also the machine is and invination of privites and some students might not want their emotions read

Most students are under stress by school work and the could easly be read by anyone and it would be a waste of the schools money to read the emotion of a student. Also the student could be sad, angery, or happy about something totally differant from school work, and that means it could throw the machine off.

I think the Facial Action Coding System should not be used in schools and never should be. Machines should never be able to read emotions.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"dear principle

I have heard that your new rule was that students have to have a B average to play sports I disagree with this rule because first sports can keep kids healthy and not over weight secondly I believe that sports is a way to get students mind off of school.

The reason I think sports is should be a priority is because they keep you healthy and if kids are over weight they will probably be made fun of.

Secondly school may be overwhelming for some students and when they get home they just do more overwhelming homework so if they have sports to go to that would get there mind of school and get it refocused then they will be more prepared.

This is the reasons I think that in order to play spots you have to have a B average is the wrong rule to apply to our school.

thank you for your time",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal

I know that many students don't respect the school rules. They are using their phones during class instead of putting attention, or people steal their phones and etc,. and just wasting money buying one and another.

Its better to do not allow students to have phones at school, so they can put more attention to class. But what happen if its an emergency and a student didn't bring his phone because his school do not allow cell phones?

He has to call his parents so they can pick him up because they don't know at what time to pick him up because sometimes he has tutoring sometimes not, or maybe they are busy or in another close city. He can't enter to the school to call his parents because the school its already ended, for some reason, like here in my school that they do not allow students to go in after school ends. He can't call his aunt, uncle grandma even his parents, Why? Because he doesn't have a cell phone. What would happen to that student? So then, where is he going?",0,persuade_corpus,4
"NASA has recently been discussing what is believed to be a face on mars. Some people think that this is some kind of alien marking. The essay says, ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""(paragraph 2) This may convince certain people to believe that there was once life on Mars.

While it may be true, the essay does not say anything about anyone actually getting on Mars to see if it was really just a rock. Maybe there were bones from a human body attatched to the head. Also in the essay it states, ""although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.""(paragraph 6)

As a result, the essay also said ' ""we felt this was important to taxpayers,"" explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.""(paragraph 6) So this statement could be implying that they could be making stuff up just for money. If they put that in the newspaper everyone would want to buy it, which would result in making a lot of money.

In addition, the essay says, ""only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""(paragraph 2) this evidence from the article supports my claim and says shadows made it look like something. It could also have been the way something was reflecting off of it.

In conclusion, I believe that this thing was just a natural landform. Many of us have seen weird shaped rocks sometimes we just dont pay attention. Also just like the sun forms shadows, that could have been what happened on Mars to make people believe they were seeing a human face.         ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Phones and Driving

In 1973, the first handheld cell phone was made. 23 years later, the first ever flip phone was introduced to the public. Cell phones have come a long way since they were first invented, and today people rely on them for more than just communication. Smartphones. For instance, can do anything you can imagine, and we rely on them so much there's no telling where we would be without them. In fact, people use their cell phones practically 24/7. People text on the toilet, stream music in the shower, and unfortunately, use their phones while driving. This is probably the worst thing about cell phones. Phone related car crashes are one of the most common causes of fatalities in teens and adults. 1.6 million crashes a year are the result of people using their phones while driving. No one, not even the most skilled driver in the world should be able to use a cell phone in any way while driving.

It's not always easy to control a vehicle. Weather conditions, traffic, and other people make driving very difficult sometimes. If you add the distraction of a cell phone, driving is 10 times more difficult to focus on. You've probably seen someone text and drive. In the few seconds they take to glance away from the road and at their phones, a car crash could happen. It only takes one second for your car to swerve into the other lane. Phones should never be used while driving for many reasons, and the main reason being that it is extremely dangerous. Texting and driving makes you 23% more likely to get in an accident. It's so much smarter to wait until you've reached your destination to use your phone. If you can't wait, you can pull over on the side of the road. If not, you could greatly risk your life.

Another important reason why operating a phone while driving should be prohibited involves other drivers as well as passengers that may ride in your car. When someone rides in your vehicle, whether its a friend or your child, you are responsible for them. By using your phone at the wheel, you put both you and your passengers at risk of injury or even death. You also put the strangers driving beside you at risk. Texting and driving doesn't just risk you. Most fatal car crashes involve more than one car. If you don't want to live with the fact that you hurt someone you love or even just a stranger, using your phone while driving shouldn't be an option.

Lastly, in some states, using your phone while driving is illegal and can cost you a lot of money. In georgia, for instance, holding a cellphone while not parked, or even pressing one button on a phone can get you a ticket. With each offense, the fines get larger. It's not worth paying a large ticket to send a short text message. Additionally, if someone dies in a car crash because of your actions, such as texting and driving, you could be charged with vehicular manslaughter and go to jail for up to 20 years. Texting and driving tickets, if shown on a police report for a wreck you are responsible for, will greatly increase your insurance rates, making your life a lot harder than it was before you decided to text and drive. Unless you have a money tree in your backyard and don't mind ridiculous insurance for the rest of your life, its best to wait until you get home to use your phone.

In conclusion, it's hard to imagine why anyone would think using a phone while driving is a good idea. Nothing good can come from texting or talking on the phone behind the wheel. The best decision anyone can make is to completely forget about their phones while driving and focus on the road. You risk so many things by using your phone while operating a vehicle.. You risk your life, your friends life, strangers lives, and even the money in your pocket. The only exception to being on a phone while driving should be to report an emergency. Otherwise, the use of a cell phone is risky and should be completely banned all over the world. Statistics alone should be enough to open people's eyes to the dangers of using their phone in the car. Phones are distracting and without a doubt should not be used while operating a vehicle.

"Face on Mars! Natural landform? or Created by Aliens? I believe that the structure is a natural landform. NASA would not want to hide life on mars. They have been researching for years to find life on Mars.

NASA has been researching Mars for years looking for living things. Nothing was ever found. So, why believe there was ever ancient civilization on Mars, if through out all the research, nothing was ever found. Some still disagree and believe that there is new life on Mars. But, in order for there to be a new there has to be an old.

When Garvin decided he wanted to get a better look at the face on Mars himself, he also agreed that it would be a natural landform. He used a digital image three times bigger that the pixle size. Therefore, if there were any signs of live, shakes, houses, aliens, ect. you would be able to point it out from the picture.

Yet, there was still nothing found. Although some people still believe aliens live on Mars, and aliens created the face structure. There is proof that you can not spot any digns of life on Mars. So, therefore, we come to the conclusion that the structure was a natural landfor, that just so happened to look like a face.   ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Senator,

I favoring of keeping the Electoral College because it aviods run-off elections and the certainy of outcome .If it aviods run-off elections then no canidate can get the most votes in a vote cast. According to the article Does the Electoral College work source three states, Nixon in 1968 and cliton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurity or the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College(301 and 307 electoral votes respectively).The electoral college is important because it can do certainty of the outcome . It's important that it has it so that it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. According to the article Does the Electoral College worksource three states,In the 2012 election,for example Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the elcetoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney.I also what to keep the Electoral College so that nothing goes wrong if it gets changed. For example, if one thing in the electoral college is gone, then the whole thing may be affected by it.

"Dear Principal,

Students use phones in various ways: either to talk to their friends, for calculators, but also for emergencies. I do believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school.

I don't think they should have the freedom to text anytime of the day.

I think if you would limit them on texting and stress the rule of no texting in class then Policy 1 would work fine.

I would make sure that when the students walk into class after lunch or one of the free periods that their phones were turned off.

It wouldn't take much time to check this, but it would make sure that the policy was working.

If you made a rule about NO phones at all, I think a lot of parents would be a little aggravated.

A lot of things could happen in a day of school: fights, a change in plans at the last minute, or even a family member in need and that student needs to know.

If you limited the rules to where no phones were allowed a lot of things could happen and if it is an emergency that person has a less likely chance of getting help when they need it.

During the free periods, if the student does have their phones out texting, I would suggest that they keep their phones on vibrate or silent.

This would be very courteous to the person next to them studying for a test or reading just for fun.

I think Policy 1 is the right choice for the school, as long as the rules are stressed and the other students don't disturb another peer by doing it.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principal,

Sports are a very important factor to many schools.

Many kids take sports for granted, and don't focus on their school work.

Our Principal is considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

I fully agree and support this idea.

Despite the fact that many students have a grade C or below average, this new policy would encourage students to do well in school so that they can participate in sports, more students in the school would have grades of B's and even A's, and the sports teams and activities would be smarter and more successful as a result.

Overall, a requirement of a B average to play sports would be beneficial to our school's community as a whole.

If a new rule is put into play requiring all students to have at least a B average to play sports, students with averages of C and below would be encouraged to bring their grade up.

For example, many of the athletes with averages below B would have a reason to bring their grade up, or else they won't be able to participate in the activity that they love.

All of the athletes would change their priorities so that school comes first.

This rule would encourage students to do better in school so that they can participate in the activities that they love.

They would have a goal of achieving a B average, and applying themselves to achieve that goal. Overall, a requirement of a B average to participate in sports and other activities would be logical to put into play because it encourages students to do well in school and bring their grades up.

From this new rule, more students would have A and B averages as a result.

With a requirement of a B average to participate in extracurricular activities, more students would have the goal of achieving a B average.

As a result, less students would be failing their courses do to lack of effort or time.

With more students with a higher average, the school would look better in terms of grades.

Now that their is a requirement of a B average to participate in sports, music, or another activity, the school would have much smarter students.

As a result, these students would be sent to better colleges.

This would make the school less known for its bad things, but more well-known for its high academic prestige.

This requirement would be the most reasonable choice because less students would be failing courses.

As a result of requiring a B average amongst students in order to participate in sports and other activities, the teams would be much smarter and more successful.

For example, the smarter students that earn a B average or even higher would use the knowledge that they learned in the classroom and apply it onto the field.

Instead of having sports teams that consisted of students who didn't make the right decisions and were failing out of their courses, the teams would consist of smart students who applied themselves to reach their goal of earning at least a B average in academics.

On the field, court, or rink, the sports team would be making much smarter plays, and ultimately becoming more successful.

The time has come to decide whether or not to make a requirement of a B average amongst students in order to participate in sports or other activities.

This requirement would be beneficial to our school's community because it would encourage students to do well in the classroom, more students would have a B or higher grade average, and the sports teams would be much smarter and more successful as a result.

So, Mr. Principal, go and make a requirement of a B or higher grade average in order to participate in sports or other activities!",0,persuade_corpus,1
"To Principal:

I think is not a good idea because, students wants to be in sports and activities , and all most of the students don't have a grade B .

I think it would be better if they have a grade C , because , in that way the students can be in sports, activities and they can study too.

I also think people can have sports so they can work out, and having a C

its good , because I think C is a good grade. Some moms wants a higher grade, but sometimes the sports distract us from studying. But i think if we really care about the sports we will be better on studying because its important to us. And if we are good at studying we can enjoy sports.

The grade B , its to high and also a C its good for enjoy sports. And in some classes we are going to have a better grade then C, but in other classes that maybe we are not good at, we don't get it or understand , or just because we don't like it , we are going to have a D but if we really care about sports , i think we can do better then a D , we can try our best and get a least a C .

And that's why I'm against of requiring at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principal,

I believe that having to maintain of have a b average can be a good and bad thing. The good side is that the people with the c averages will have more time to concentrate on their work instead of basketball or other sports. On the other hand, it could be a bad thing because some people are trying their hardest but they just can't get the b average and they should be able to play sports.

The idea of having people in sports maintain a b average has some benefits. There is the obvious everyone in sports are passing. The benefit of the players having good grades will show they are responsible and trustworthy. You also would not have to worry about the games getting in their way because of their grades. Maintaining a b average also gives the players a border line on their grades; helping them focus so they can stay on the team. It also might make people want to try to get the b average, raising their grade, to get into the sports.

The idea of having players maintain a b average can also be a bad thing. They could make the team and start to forget about their grades. They also might feel pressured because they have to sustain a certain grade to play something they love to do for the school they want to represent. We might also be missing out on very talented sports stars by setting a line in which they have to be in to play sports. For example, we could have a really talented basketball player but his or her grades start slipping and they are taken out of basket ball.

The idea of having to have at least a b average can go many directions. Though it seems like its a fabulous idea it could hurt our athletic group. I think the statement ""setting an average they have to be at in order to play sports"" is a very intelligent idea, but maybe a c+ or something more reasonable for students to reach would be a better guideline. Though some might think it is unreasonable, its a fair decision and i go along with your decision. I hope you consider my thoughts.

"There has always been extracurricular activities being offered in schools, even in my old house in Generic_City, but many students don't take advantage of these resources given to them. This is why I believe that students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity. I make this claim for three reasons, the first of which being that students are more involved in the community that the school built around them. My second reason is that students doing sport related activities helps with exercise and having the need to stay in shape for the team and the school. Last but not least, my third reason is that students that may not have many friends could use these activities as a way to get to know people that are doing the same sport or are in the same band. So I believe that these extracurricular activities would be beneficial not only to the students but the school as a whole.

For my first reason I stated that doing an extracurricular activity helps students get involved in a community that was created around them. Students that join sports or other activities provided usually get to know others that participate in the same team or group that the student does. Another reason to back up my claim is that in clubs or competitive sports teams these students generally train together and help each other succeed in the task that they are working towards achieving. I believe that these activities would help tremendously with letting students get to know each other and further strengthening the schools community.

My second claim is that doing extracurricular sports help students get exercise that generally they would not get, had they not been told to do any exercise outside of school. If these students play for a school team (football, wrestling, etc.) there is intense training involved that from, personal experience, is not easy. Im not saying to go run a mile or anything but these sports try to get every competitor in great condition in order to get students to succeed in tournaments and bouts or matches against other teams. So there is a huge exercise component to most sport related activities.

For my third reason, let's start with a small story. So, imagine that there is a student that moves around every two to four years. it was pretty difficult to make friends so he generally stayed at home playing video games by himself and didn't really go out at all. That was me until around three years ago and doing sports like wrestling and rugby have helped me make friends. So I understand how difficult it is to always be the new kid but these activities let me make friends and get to know people. Students that do these activities usually make friends with the people that have the same interests in activities.

I believe that enforcing this rule would be beneficial not only to the school but the students as well and these reasons are why I believe in this rule. Communities get built around the students when they do these extracurricular activities. Physical fitness is also a big motivator for a few students with sports related activities. And last but not least, these students can make friends in these activities like I did when I used to move around a lot. Extracurricular activities would be a good service to enforce in schools.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I believe the author article can be supported with his/her study and details. In my option I think that trying to explore further into the idea of entering Venus's atmosphere might be dangerous; however, it could lead to a whole new story and new exploration. Taking the time to figure a way to land on Venus safely will take time, the technology and spaceship that would be used to enter Venus atmosphere will need to be excellant, and it might take risk on peoples lives trying to enter and explore a whole new planet.

Scientist often referr Earth's ""Twin"" as Venus because it is the closest plalnet to Earth in terms of density and size, quoted in paragraph 2. If Venus is very similar to Earth, it could mean that life could live on Venus such as how life lives on Earth to this day. ""Long ago, Venus was probably cover largely wit oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (Paragraph 4). This shows that scientist have perdicted theories over Venus and are still currently trying to solve and prove their theory. Finding a way to get to Venus is the problem we have here on Earth. In the text it states ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (paragraph 2). This shows that Venus is very different than the Planet we live on and it will take time to create a space shuttle that is well fit to enter Venus's atmospere.

The technology and spaceshuttles have not been made or designed to enter an atmosphere so powerful yet. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" (paragraph 3). The information that scientists are finding on Venus is amazing and will help other scientist find ways to design a spaceshuttle to get through the blanket of Venus. Venus has a very hot surface level of 90 times greater than the surface level than the Earth. We need to discover a way to allow our spaceships to under go the high pressure that it would have to go through to enter Venus.

NASA has one issue that they struggle on besides buildling the spaceships that they would want to send to Venus. That struggle is sending a human to Venus, and not knowing what will happen on the trip there. Is it worth risking a life to explore or not sending anyone and forget about this whole experiment? If I had to pick, my answer would be Yes. I believe that finding a new Planet that life could live on just like Earth could continue the species of mankind. No man has under gone more pressure than the Earth's atmosphere, and Venus atmosphere could destroy anything that we create that enters its atmosphere including a human if we sent them.

In conclusin, I believe it is worth continuing to study and figure a way to have a spaceshuttle land in the planet of Venus. Eventually when it is safe and we have solved how to create a safe space shuttle that a human can survive and enter Venus. Being able to explore Venus and find ways to live on the planet could start a new way of life for mankind. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Pairing older and younger students together can have a plethora of educational benefits for both parties. Not only does it give younger students a chance to learn from more experienced peers, but it also allows older students to gain experience in leadership. For example, older students can teach younger students essential academic skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking, while younger students can help the older students stay up-to-date on the latest trends in technology and social media. 

Both students can benefit from the social aspect of partnering together. The younger student can gain a role model to emulate and a strong, positive influence from the older student. The older student can hone their leadership skills by encouraging the younger student to do their best and stay engaged. In addition to these academic and social benefits, the students can enhance their emotional intelligence by learning to express and accept emotions in healthy ways. 

Overall, pairing older and younger students together can result in many positive outcomes, both academically and socially. The combined knowledge and experience from both sets of students can develop an environment of learning and exploration that can be immensely beneficial to both parties.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"A project during summer vacation! summer vacation was suppose to be about having fun not doing boring old school work. Some schools require students to do projects over the summer. While some may say that the projects should be teacher designed, because the teachers know what they want the students to learn about. The summer projects given to students should be designed by no other than the students themselves. Students designing projects themselves will lead to many positive things, first students will actually do these summer projects, secondly they will be more engaged to what they are learning from this project, and lastly they will learn more about what they like personally.

To start off, if their summer projects were designed by students they would actuallly do them. Alot of times when the teacher assigns a project many students won't turn that project in at all. This results in conflicts such as bad grades. Most times students don't do these projects because they are not intrested in them. Summer is on of the biggest breaks students get from school, so why would they wanna spend it doing projects for school that are boring. Students share intrests, so if a student were to design a project that was educational but in common intrests of those around them. The other students would actually do this project because it's something they like.

They may even come up with partner projects that will help with students social skills. This Allows them to open up about things they don't understand about projects when they are in the class room.

Secondly, student designed projects will allow students to be more engaged in their projects. There is no kid anywhere in the world you can get to engage in something they don't like or want to do, unless you force them to do it. Well same goes for summer projects if a student doesn't want to do it they will not be engaged in it. Not engaging in things such as projects can lead to sloppy, messed up, and badly graded work.

This doesn't allow students to show teachers what they are really able to do. Other students know what their fellow peers strong point and weaknesses are. They can design fun and intriuging way to learn but also have fun while doing their summer project. When they do design fun projects like this it will let these students become engaged in what they are learning.

Finallly, student designed projects will allow the student body to learn more about their intrests personally. The whole point of school is to learn about the world and learning skills we will need when we grow up. Along the way you will learn youe strong points and your weaknesses. You figure out what you like and don't like doing. Taking your strong points and intrests to poin you in the direction you should go in. A project that's student designed for their own personally intrests will allow them to grow. They will learn all they can because that project will be something fun and engaging about something they want to know more about personally. This will let them flourish in the field they want to learn about.

In conclusion, Schools requiring students to do summer projects should let the projects be student designed. Students know what their peers want to know about. These projects will be more student based so they will actually do them. Activities they want to learn about is where you will find the students to be more engaged. When projects are designed by students it will be about topics they themselves are intrested in, allowing them to learn more about these topics. Students should design required summer projects because they are the ones doing the projects.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear principal,

Please allow us to bring our cell phones to school. they are not something for us to just play around with. Most of the students that go to this school have android powered phones, which means that most of the kids at this school can use their cell phones to help them with their work if they were allowed the privilege. It states in policy 1,"" To allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as long as the phones are turned off during class time."" Either way it goes we have to earn the privilege to use and bring our cell phones to school. But you have to understand that the young people now are at the age of technology which means that we are more comfortable with technology than our ancestors. You have some kids now that can make technology run around in circles, because that's what has been imbedded in to their brains and it just comes naturally. whichever way it goes we have to earn the privilege to use our phones in school so we will really try to earn this privilege.

"In the passage ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because venus could possibly be a planet that once had life on it. Venus may have once been the most Earth like planet in our solar system.

The author states in Paragraph 4,

""Long Ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, like Earth."" The author put this in the passage to explain why we should keep trying to explore Venus despite the dangers it presents. If we were to continue exploring Venus and there was life on the planet then we could possibly find out what killed the living things and how long they survived on venus and if something similar could happen to Earth.

The author also states in Paragraph 8, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author put this in the passage to explain that if there was once life on Venus and whatever killed them could happen to us, so we need to explore Venus so we know what things to watch for so we don't end up like the forms of life possibly did on Venus.

The author sugests the idea ""that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"" because we could possibly explore Venus but may not be to that level because there are still many things that need to be figured out before anyone can land on Venus and survive longer than a couple hours.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME you should not allow kids to us their phone in class or anywhere in school because they will get distracted and not do their class work and not pay attention to the teacher. Another reason why you shouldn't allow phones in school because the kids could call their parents to come pick them up when their not even sick. Or when their a test going on and the kid doesn't know the answer the kid could just text his friend for the answer.

One day i was inn class and this kid was sitting in the back of the class with his head down not listening to the teacher who was teaching the lesson so i thought to my self he already knows this. So after the teacher stopped teaching she gave out the class work and the kid still had his head down and we only had 10 minutes to finish the test. So after five minutes he puts his head up and starts to ask everyone what did we have to do and nobody told him. Finally time runs up and the teacher asked him why he didn't do his work and he didn't answer so she herd his phone vibrate and she asked him to give it to her and she saw that he was texting some one from another class so she gave him detention.

Another reason why you shouldn't allow phone at school is because kids just text their parents to pick them up saying their sick when their really not. So one day I am in math class and by the speaker they called a kid in my class down because he was sick and was going home early and when the kid got up to leave he had a smile on his face. So the teacher stopped him and asked him what was wrong with him and he started to walk faster and didn't responded to her and he just left the class.

Finally the third reason why you shouldn't allow kids to use their phone in school is because when their is a test and the kids are stuck in a question that they don't know they will text their friends to get the answer. Like on day my teacher past out this test and twenty minutes after the test a phone rings and it was this kids phone who sits in the back of the class so the teacher asked for it and he saw the someone sent him a message with an answer. So the teacher confiscated his phone and gave him an F on the test.

so now you know why i think phone shouldn't be allowed in school because the kids will text their parents to come pick them up get distracted in class and cheat on their test .

"Summer, a time of joy, warmth, traveling, and making memories. Students and teachers count down the days til the end of the school year, and the start of their favorite time of year. There is a mutual appreciation from the students and teachers, they can have a break from their everyday jobs! Students are burned out from school during the summer time, they live freely without their normal load of stress carried on their shoulders. Although this is a wonderful time, responsibilities are still present. Education still needs to progress, even through the fun. Summer projects should be student-designed, so the creativity, and excitement of completing the project is still present.

Students want freedom, they want to be able to get cut loose from a teacher's tight grip on a curriculum, and a summer project is the perfect way to give the students what they want. This can create an adventure for the student, and give an opportunity for the student to learn something on their own. As a student myself, my least favorite projects are ones where everybody is doing the same thing, there is a strict rubric, and there is a sense of the teachers way, or NO way. In high school, students feel like they are less respected and seen as elementary students if they are put under such strict guidelines. Students do not get excited for a project they do not care about it, or have any personal connection to it. By giving a loose project topic, the students have the ability to take what you provided for them, and run with the idea independently. This creates a bigger sense of ownership of the project, and something they can be proud of.

The last thing a teenager would want to do during the summer time is school work! If it is a project on a subject they enjoy, it can potentially have a better turnout, with a better grade, then a project where the teacher provides the design guidelines. I have a friend that once needed to complete a summer assignment, it was for science. It required her to analyze different leafs with a magnifying glass, and right a report on her observations. She did not care to do this, and had no motivation to spend her freetime completing a project she did not take interest in. End of summer comes around, and it never got done, she ended up with a D- on this project. She recieved this grade because of the lack of interest, and how boring the assignment was to her. It was not a great start to her school year. In contrast to my friend, my science teacher gave us a project prompt with freedom; create a project relating to science! My friends and I had a blast making this project, keeping it educational, but it still allowed us to do fun activities! The project received an A+. These different project designs put two students in very different positions; a bad grade with a boring, and no effort outcome, then a student filled with excitement, and a good grade. The impact a project can do on a student is important, especially during their time of year where they want to have fun.

Some may argue that summer projects would not have as much of an educational connection if it is student designed. A teacher assigning a research essay will have a more educatonal relation then doing a student chosen topic and activity. This opinion could be shown by the older generation of teachers, where traditional learning styles are better. This is not necessarily true, as creativity combined with education can be more beneficial to students. A survey showed that student chosen projects recieved better grades and more participation. 93% of the surveyed students said they put more effort into their chosen topics, and form of presentation, because it was not chosen by the teacher. There would not be a lack of educational content, if the loose rubric outlined the mandatory educational part of the project. This keeps the projects having a wide variety, while they must stay educational to recieve a good grade.

Students need a break from the strict, instructional environment, the one they are in all year. Summer is their time to have that break. These few months can still provide the educational progression they need, but with a free of choice. Creativity is what shapes this world, and provides advancement in our society. If students are not creative through their schooling now, how will they be creativity in the future?         ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principal,

I completely agree with you on the fact that students should have to earn a B average grade in order to do any extra-curricular activities. I think that this should really be enforced. We shouldn't let anything get in the way of our education, because no one can take that from us. It gives us the skills we need for life, a chance for better opportunities, and it gives us a discipline that we will need as we get older.

For one of all reasons, students are here primarily to learn. Without learning, we won't be able to do the activities we do. As a musician, you have to be able to count your music notes to know when to sing or play them at what time. You need math for this. In basketball you have to know when and where is a good time and place to shoot the ball into the hoop. You need science for this. Without our education, it's impossible to do these things.

Second, many students who are in activities are expecting to do it professionally when they get older. It's a one in a million chance that you will get drafted out of high school, or become the next famous musician in high school. Even if you do, coaches and talent agents wants the person with the better grades, and most school experience. They want an intelligent person who can take their team or band to the next level.

You'll need an education to go to college so you will get a chance to pursue your dreams. You won't get discovered in Community College. So, you will need the best grades you can get to go to the best colleges in the nation, which will open so many opportunities for students.

Third, if students are failing, and still attend extra-curricular activities, that shows a lack of discipline that they will need in order to survive in our world. If they think that they can fail a subject, and still have the luxury to take fun activities, then that takes away responsibilities. If they're the best football player in the country, and don't know any math, how are they going to be able to pay for their bills, or do their taxes. They'll rely on others to do it for them, who could possibly steal their money because of the lack of discipline they had in school.

Without education, our world is impossible to grow. We rely on mathematicians to advance our world financially. Someone once said, ""Money makes the world spin."", which is a very true statement.

Concluding my argument, I think you should enforce the fact that students should earn a B average grade to get into any extra-curricular activity.

Sincerely,

Student",0,persuade_corpus,2
"I know people think the face on Mars is something that was created by some kind of life, but really it is not. This is acually just a landform. The face was found in the region of the red planet called Cydonia. It is very hard for NASA to get the picture because they have to angle the satalite just right. I am not trying to be pestimistic but, NASA has seen landforms on Mars before and the article says,""the mouth, nose, and eyes are allusions caused by shadows"". The facts just dose not add up to their being life on Mars.

This face is just a landform. There are many ways this landform could have happend. For example, a duststorm, astroids crashing on the planet, or underground volcanos. These are all examples of how the face could have been created. The article says it was caused by butte or mesa. Time for everyone to come up with a new theory!

This face was found in the area Cydonia. One day the aircraft Viking 1 was circaling the plant and found the face. Could you imagine the scientist face when the aircraft reported it back. A few days later they released it to the public. Lots of people were confinced that it was caused by some kind of lifeform, but really it was not.

It was hard work for NASA to get the picture because they had to rotate the aircraft at 30 degrees. This was not easy because if they went to far Nasa would miss the face. If they did not go all the way around Nasa would still miss it . It had to be perfect. It could have been 29 degrees, one of, but it did not matter it would still miss it. It had to be perfect. NASA finnaly got the picture and proved that there was no lifeform.

The nose, mouth, and eyes are caused by shadow illusions. They might have been formed by astroids crashing there, but are most likely shadow illusions. These illusions are caused when the Mars acsis are tillted a certain way and the sun hits it. This is most likly how the shadow allusion happened. This is what scientist says caused the illusion.

In conclusion there were many ways for this landform to happen. Do not think this was caused by some kind of life form because there is not enough proff. There are many ways this could have been formed. For example. A dust storm, or underground volcano the list goes on. It may never be solved what caused it. Just face it it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.",0,persuade_corpus,4

A person that would like a car would have to pay 40,000 for a parking space ,along with a home . 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent of them sold there car to move down here .

This could be a growing trend to seperate suburban life from auto use as a movement called ""smart planning "". Which could help in the future .

Not driving can clean up the air for the global city and wont take to much pollution in Paris . In paris people with any kind of veichle that contains a motor with evan -numbered license plates had to levae their cars at home or have to deal with a 22-euro fine . It would apply the next day to the odd-number license plates too. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined . People would have their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine .

"As we journey through life, it is important to strive to grow in order to strengthen our skills and improve our abilities. Trying new things instead of staying in the same place and never growing is a great way to accomplish this. By exposing ourselves to new experiences, we can discover talents or skills that we may have never known we had. Learning to cook a new recipe or playing a new sport for the first time can open us up to completely new skills and new talents that we can explore. 

For example, taking a pottery class could open up a whole new world of three-dimensional art that we had no idea we could create. Or, if we decide to learn an instrument, we can surprise ourselves with our own aural abilities. Trying new things can also help us gain valuable knowledge for the future and help us build self-confidence. 

So if you’ve ever wondered how you can become the best version of yourself, start reaching out of your comfort zone and try something new. It may present you with new and unexpected opportunities to grow—and who knows, you just might find a new passion or talent you never knew you had!",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"In this reading, the author is talking about exploring venus, but all his evidence speaks differently. I believe the author does not support the clam that Venus is a worthy pursuit because the evidence given is mediocre. He contradicts himself in many paragraphs proving why we shouldn't send people over, and has not given any reason why we should go over there.

In this short persuasive article, the author does not pursuade at all. In paragraph two, the backround of Venus is given, but it's not stated why its important to visit this planet. ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" The only valid reason givin in this short story is when it is said in paragraph 4, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This statement gives no reason for traveling and researching Venus except for the fact it used to be like Earth.

Though it is said Earth is one of a kind, this article states Venus is the most like Earth planet they've ever found. That could be a valid reason to explore and consider inhabiting, but it is proven with evidence that Venus is inhospitable and would serve no purpose in researching and visiting. In paragraph three, it is said, ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These conditions are said to be inhospitable in paragraph four. It is also said, ""Such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean and liquify."" This evidence says the planet is almost impossible to visit and collect data on, except in the fifth paragraph, it is a very long explanation as to how we could even study venus. This is then contradicted in the sixth paragraph by saying photography and videography are ineffective because of the thick atmosphere, and no samples would be possible because the ground conditions are too bad for humans, and even metal.

In conclusion, the evidence the author has given us condradicts and outweighs the evidence given for the idea Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, meaning he did not support this idea. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"One of the most widely discussed topics regarding work-life balance and time management is the question of how much time one should devote to work. One potential answer to this question could be working 10 hours a day for four days per week. While that number of hours can be beneficial in some areas in life, others may suffer if this hours schedule is too demanding. In this essay, I will discuss the potential effects that working this kind of schedule has on people's school and career life, looking at its impacts on health, emotions, personal life responsibilities, and effectiveness of learning.

The most obvious effect of working 10 hours a day for four days a week is an increase in stress levels and a decrease in one's physical health. This type of workload can cause fatigue, anxiety, irritability, and an overall sense of being overwhelmed. Furthermore, it can leave less time for physical activity and eating healthily, leading to an increased risk of illnesses.

When it comes to emotions, a 10-hour workday could also lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and burnout. This schedule may leave one feeling unable to fulfill everyday tasks, as well as their responsibilities in their personal life. Time spent away from loved ones due to work commitments could trigger feelings of loneliness, guilt, and frustration.

At the same time, extra pressures on resources such as productivity, energy, and focus can significantly influence one’s ability to study and work effectively. Too many hours at work could lead to time lost on academic tasks, reduce the opportunities to learn, and cause difficulty in managing one’s attention span and increasing their effectiveness.

In conclusion, it’s important to consider the potential effects of working 10 hours a day for four days a week on both school and career life. It is essential to consider the impacts on health, emotions, personal life responsibilities, and learning effectiveness before making a decision.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"I think the limiting for car usage is not right because if people want to drive they should be able to. Walking, and riding bicycles aren't fun you get tired really easy and have to stop but when you are in a car you don't get tired and you don't have to stop you just keep driving.

Driving a car is easier because when you are late for work or getting somewhere you can get there faster. If you are walking or riding a bike your not going to get there on time a car is faster and quicker to get to places without any trouble. Gas could be high but it is worth it because a lady with three kids could be rushing trying not to be late for work and trying to get her kids ready for school so instead of walking them to school or riding bikes she could just drive them to school and not be late for work. Driving a car is so much easier and quicker.

Traffic with cars is bad but when you need to get places you can drive a car instead of taking the bus that has to stop ten different places. Cars are being banned in Columbia and you can only ride buses or taxis. Taxis can get you where you need to just as fast as your own car can but a bus couldn't because there is always people in front of you that have to get off in different places. They made two seated bikes just for this man and his wife to get around because they didn't want them driving there cars.

Teenagers get there license at a young age now and they start driving. They drive to school and to practices and everywhere else but it could be dangerous because some teenagers just like to goof and round and try to act all bad and then end up hurting them self and somebody else and it would be their fault. Some teens just decide not to get them because it is safe just to ride with their parents instead of them driving and having the chance to get in a wreck and hurt their self and then there car be ruined and won't be able to get a new one. Most teens love to drive because it's fun and they like getting out on there own. Teens like to go out and hang with there friends or go get something to eat. Other people are more worried about there job and social life then trying to get a car so they can drive all the time.

In conclusion, a limiting on car usage should be that they shouldn't have a limiting on car usage because most people are late for stuff when they don't drive there car. Walking and driving a car is way different a car is way faster then walking and trying to get to places on time. That is my opinion on limiting to car usage.                        ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Floridas state senator, I am righting this letter to tell you about why I think that we should ude the popular vote for the president of the United State. I have three main resons i would like to touch up on. It will give the poeple of the United States the chance to say who they want in the congree and say who we wnt to be our presedent. The Electoral College is not a democratic way of handleing it. But on the down side it can make things very unorganized, having us worry about every little person we have to put into congress.

In the United States we are a eaqual and fair contry, but with the Electoral College it does not us, the people of our fine nation the one to elect our presadent. It does not give us the freedom of making our own choices n who want to run our contry. But if we use the popular vote for the presadent of the united states it lets us, the people choose. It lets us the poeple the right to use our own opion and our own thought on who should run this country. Every person in this cutry has a voivce they do and they should be able to speak with thier voice.

If we use the Electoral Colledege it is not democratic. It does not let us the people choose. The Electoral Colledge baseecely sees that the citizens of our contrys opions do not matter. They are saying that the Electoral Colledges votes matter the most those are the only once we are worrying about. But thats not true our opion does matter, we are what make up this amazing cuntry not just the Electoral Colledge.

But you see there is up side to using the Electoral Colledge. It can keep us organized and what i mean by that is it will help the pople know who exactly all comes with the vote of the presedent. It also makes it alot esier to just vote for one group instead of voting for all 34 people. It will keep the people from accsadentaly voting for the wrong group. It will help the poeple make there desion on what they think best and not hat they have been told is the best choice.

The popoular vote for presadent is the best way to go. It gives the pople a voice and the Ellectoral Colledge isnt democratic. But the Electoral Colledge keep us, the people organized and helps us make the right decition.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Every day, we come into contact with a variety of people, whether it's a stranger on the street or a potential new boss. As humans, we often make snap judgments that are based on first impressions, and it's no secret that these initial impressions can have a lasting impact on relationships, both personally and professionally. The significance of a first impression is relevant in a myriad of situations, as it has the potential to shape the way one is perceived.

The way one presents themselves and their immediate attitude and behavior are some of the biggest factors in leaving a good first impression. Depending on the situation, it's a good idea to be aware of body language and practice exhibiting respect and kindness towards others as these behaviors can assist in creating a favorable first impression. 

Although the impact of first impressions can be notable, it may not be possible to change the impression someone has of you after the first meeting. This can be especially true in cases when an individual has a knee-jerk reaction to a situation, as these types of initial reactions can be difficult to alter. It is important to remember that, despite the fact that some first impressions may be impossible to change, everyone is deserving of kindness and respect.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"I am all for this new technology to read peoples emotions. If we could read their emotions it would be easier to help people to get better if they are in a bad place in life. It would help so many people that are depressed and need help but afrad ask for it. And when people get help with their emotions they become more stable then they were before.

Im all for the values of using this new emotion technology because you tell if people are faking a smile. You can tell because when you fake it you dont use the same muscles as when you really smile. When you fake smile the muscles you use are zygomatic major that make your mouth stretche sideways and the risori. But when you really smile you use the muscles called zygomatic major that begin at your cheek bones and life the corners of your mouth. The other muscle you use is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus which makes crow's-feet around your eyes.

"The Benefits of Extracurricular Activities

A normal student's day consists of sitting in a classroom chair, writing, and stairing at a board. Students don't really do much after school except sit down even more, or just continue to write and do other homework. They need to do more than just sit around and write. After school activities could really stop students from being so lazy. Principals can change school rules and have students do other extracurricular activities. I would agree to this decision to make students participate in atleast one extracurricular activity, because they can teach students to be more social, build problem solving skills, and provide more physical activity.

These activities could teach the students to be more social, and to open up to more than just their phones. These social skills that they would bulid over time, will become a huge necessity in their future. When they are adults the are meet new people and be around new people, so they need to know how to handle that. Their chances of finding a job would be lower. Social skills could even build problem sovling skills, which also become important as they get older.

Problem solving skills are very important. Activities like clubs after or before school can really help with this. In their future they're going to need to know how to solve more than just a math problem. When the students become adults, and they're in a bad situation, they're not always going to be able to run back to their parents and ask them what they should do, they need to learn to solve promblems themselves. Being both mentally and physically fit can help solve problems.

Physical activity is very important aswell. Sports are by far the best way to maintain physical fitness. Although clubs can get a couple more steps, sports are still better when trying to become fit. When a student is fit, there is so much more they can do. It's overall just healthier.

Extracurricular activities have such a positive impact on students. Students who start participating in these activites can go from being lazy and not wanting to got to school, to being physically and mentally fit, and wanting to go to school so they can continue to participate in their activity. I agree with having every student participate in after school activities. In conclusion, extracurricular activities can increase students' social strength, problem solving ability, and physical fitness.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Some school are offering classes were students can attend at home, the classes can be online or by video conferencing. Schools have been offering students classes that the students can take at home, but will it help the students? Some could see it both ways depending on the student, and how the student learns the best. Some students may benefit from attending classes from home, but some students may not.

Students may benefit from attending classes at home in the way, that some students may work better and or harder if they are working alone and one on one. There are students that know what they are doing and can figure it out on there own, but other students may not be able to. I do agree that the online classes may help some students, and some students may succeed in the classes.

Other students may not benefit from attending classes at home, some students may work better if they are with a teacher. There are many students that understand the material better if a teacher explains it to them one on one, or in a class. Students may find it easier to learn hands on, and have a teacher explain, and show them, and help the students understand the material.

Schools should offer classes that can be attend at home, because students can benefit from the classes taken at home. Also schools should let the student decide rather he or she would like to take the online classes, no school should just assign a student an at home class if he or she dose not want the class.

"Cell phones are one of the biggest new technologies, and a great way to communicate. From your phone you can access your email, make calls to people around the world or send a simple text message. You can also download music, and play games. But still the question is. Should kids be allowed to use them during school?

Yes, I believe that kids should be allowed to use their phones during lunch, or whatever free time they have. During class, not so much. If that was the case, kids would be cheating on homework, assignments and tests. Also, the kids would not be as focused on their schoolwork as they should be. But, during free time they should be allowed to have them. For example. Lets say that a kid has a basketball game after school and when he gets to school, he finds out he left his shoes at home. During the next free time or lunch he could make an urgent call to his mom or dad so he could get them before the game starts.

Also, kids need social time. It's what they do. Socialize. Some kids maybe have friends from other cities, or towns. Cell phones are a great way to talk to your friends if you don't see them on a daily basis. Lastly, students need to use cell phones. It's part of our lives here in the twenty-first century. Sometimes you just need a little down time to talk to someone, listen to music, or just play games. That's why I think cell phones should be allowed during lunch or free time.

"Limiting car usage will have a advantage and major inpact on people all over the world because it will slow down polution you will spend less money and it will bring people together more

When limiting car usage it will bring down the pollution rate and help the world. Less  people have been driving since 2005, as of april 2013 9 percent less than in 1995. less people are driving in the us but more people are driving in london so they have had days where no one drives but taxies and buses.

people also will soend less money if they stop driving as much because the people will not have to buy gas,change the oil in ther vehicles. maintain the ware and tare that  then need everyday will only have to buy tires one a year because they will wear down slower with less miles on them. many people want buy and new cars because they will reilize that the dont need as much as they have been before.

By driving less it will bring more people together becasue while walking to work or on the bus people will make new friends. The will meet new people walking down the sidewalk and also more familey will stay together more becuas they will stay home more becuase it will be harder to go place that they would want across town so it would also bring famileys tgether more.

"To the principal:

Why should we be allowed to have cell phones at school? Well the first reason is football players, baseball players, cheerleader, and other after school activates have to have them for when practice is over, but i agree that we should just use them at lunch or when we have free time. We should just leave them in our back packs till after school when we need them. some people use them in class I'm not saying i don't use it in class i text all the time, But that's the teachers fault they should be up at the chalkboard teaching. Instead they sit around texting there wife's and husbands. but i think they should be two teachers in class ,one in the back ,and one up at the board. So the one in the back can look up and down the rows. But if you keep letting the teacher text in class then u should just forget about the MCT cause we never talk about school work we just sit in class like dummy's . but if u let us students bring cell phones and let us text during our free time and lunch then maybe students would get tired of texting and start doing the work.

"Dear principal,

I have read over your two possible policies you have been considering for the schools cell phone policy. I would have to choose policy number one, i will explain why it is the best choose of the two.

Policy one: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. Most of us kids would want this to be chosen as the schools cell phone policy because we love our cells. We would also be appropriate with them. When we have free time we can text of call people not being loud or bothering anyone at all.

Another reason this is a great idea is because if there is an emergency and no one has a way to contact any one we could use our cell phones to call police, fire men, doctors, animal control, just anyone. Texting will help talk to people who are in different classes about something that might be important to us teens like, a boy your crushing on, new clothes, how amazing you life was the other night.

If you could please change the cell phone policy to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as phones are turned off during class time, that would be great because then we could text, call, use internet, social networks like facebook, myspeace, twitter, and all those other ones. Cause us teens need our cell phones 24/7. And plus more people would probably try not to sneak cells in and text wile not saps to there would be less drama and we would have more fun.

so please if you will make us more happy in school!

"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. There is smog in densly populated areas that is affecting peoples lifes. They can get deathly ill because of it. We need to limit car usage because of the harmful thing that can come from it.

In dense cities there is smog that is polluting the air and making it hard to breath. If you live in an area like this for a while it can get you really sick. It can give you lung cancer, amonia, and many other things. Living in a place like this has been proven to be almost the same as being a smoker. It will hurt your lungs very badly. Breathing this air can also make the quality of life alot worse. It can make you depressed, or angry and can cause alot of other problems.

Limiting car usage will save alot of teenage lifes. Teens between the ages of 16 and 21 have the highest death rate for drivers. Limiting car usage can save many lifes. It will also save teens and adults alot of money. Paying for gas, car repairs, and for the car itself can save alot of money. There are many people struggling to live with a nice car. If they did not have to pay for that car or the gas for it it can greatly help them. Not paying for gas alone can put food on the table.

These are some of the advantages to limiting car usage. It will save many lifes from cancer, car wrecks and alot of other things.

"""A cowboy who rode the waves"" is a story where there is so much going on with so many people.

The main character in the story is ""Luke Bomberger"" he works two part-time jobs one at the Grocery Store and the other at the Bank. He has a friend named Don

Reist whom asked Luke to go to Europe with him. They would be riding on a cattle boat with 335 horses only. The reason they had to ride on a cattle boat was because World War 2 just ended and most people animals and buildings got destroyed. They were shipping animals over to Europe so that they could have their animals back. He just turned 18 before they left so he was old enough to help out. Since they had all of the horses he helped out with taking care of them they each had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. He was really good at taking care of all the horses because he used to help out on his aunt's farm with all of the animals. He had trouble sometimes when the storms would be super bad and it would make the boat rock with the bad waves. One time he was going to report back to the captin with the news on how the animals were doing because he was on nightwatch and he slipped and fell off of his ladder. When the boat started tilting he went slididng down the deck of the boat and amost went off board. He didn't go off board luckily because a metal bar stopped him from going two far but he did suffer from broken ribs and have to take some time off. On the trips back to go get more animals the people he was with would play games with him and they also got to see amazing sights on their way there and back sometimes even on the way there is they weren't too busy.

Most of the time this is what happens but his story is really interesting. Most people think it is a horrible idea to do this but I think it's a great one because you get to help people. It is nice to do something like that because most people are less fortunet and things that happened in Europe can happen to them and maybe even you when you don't ever expect it.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The use of the Facial Action Coding System , FACS, to read a students' emotional expressions in a classroom would be very valuable. It would allow a lesson to be modified to better interest a student. It would also help to keep the student from becoming so confused to the point of giving up.

Since most schools have transfered over from books and paper to Chromebooks or iPads, the system could be added to the devices. It wouldn't be able to happen immedietly, but eventually with the evolvution of technology the iPads and Chromebooks would be able to handle the program. The text states that our home PCs wouldn't be able to handle the complex algorithms, but hopefully one day they could.

This program would be beneficial to teachers so that they can see how their students are feeling when doing assignments. If three quarters of the class are using their sygomatic major muscles while reading an aritcle, then the teacher knows that they should assign more assignments like that one. If the whole class is bored to death with a particular article, then the teacher knows not to assign to many things like that on ein particular. With the teachers knowing how the students are feeling, it will help keep the students interseted in what they are doing. The teachers will know how their students are feeling about what they have been assigned. Right now, most teachers have no clue as to how the students feel about their assignments because they don't ask. This program will help the teachers stay in tune with their students.

This program will also help teachers realize when the students just aren't understanding the material. The program will recognize when a student is confused. When the teacher sees that their student is having difficulty, they will be able to offer help. Most kids think 'I'll just figure it out on my own, i don't need help.' The students think this because they are scared that the teachers may make fun of them or not help them because the teacher thinks the student is just wanting answers, or that their peers will make fun of them. If the teacher can acutally get a report from the program that a student was very confused on a particular assignment, then the teachers can pull the struggling students aside and help them without the fear that their peers will make fun of them.

This will benefit the students because they won't have to worry about the other kids making fun of them or having to struggle through an assignment they don't understsand.

When a program that can detect subtle changes in forty-four muscles in a human face is able to be used on easily accessible devices, it is going to change the way school is taught. The program will allow students to have a say in their schoolwork and to get help on assignments they would have normally just muddled through. This program is going to change education for the better!",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Ugh, I know, right? The park used to be so popular, but now it's like, deserted. I mean, I know it's still there, but no one goes there anymore. It's like, what happened? Did people just forget about it or something?

I think one reason might be that there are so many other things to do nowadays. Like, there's this new video game that everyone's been playing, and it's so cool. I know I've been playing it nonstop. And then there's TikTok, which is like, the best thing ever. You can make your own videos and share them with everyone. It's like, way more fun than going to the park.

But, like, the park is still important. I mean, it's not just a place to play games or take selfies. It's also a place to relax and unwind. You can go for a walk, read a book, or just sit and enjoy the nature. It's like, really calming and peaceful. And it's free! You don't have to pay anything to go there, which is like, awesome.

So, if people started going to the park more often, it could be like, really fun. There could be, like, picnics and stuff. You could bring your friends and have a blast. Or you could just go by yourself and enjoy the peace and quiet. It's like, totally up to you.

I know some people might be like, ""But, like, there's nothing to do there."" But, like, there are so many things you can do at the park! You can play frisbee, or soccer, or even just run around. You can also have a picnic or a barbecue. And if you're feeling really adventurous, you could try, like, rock climbing or something. It's like, way more exciting than just sitting around at home.

So, yeah, the park might not be as popular as it used to be, but it's still a really important place. And if more people started going there, it could be like, really fun. So, like, give it a try! You might be surprised at how much you enjoy",1,llama2_chat,2
"Dear Principal,

Your first policy sounds a lot more plausible and lenient to me than the second policy. School's shouldn't take phones away from the students. It'll only cause us to be more angry and use them further. If you suggest a less strict rule such as ""Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times."" I believe it will encourage the kids to only use cell phones during those times, or at least use them less frequently during class hours.

One reason I believe this is I, myself text in the lunchroom. Only because I need something from my mother or to ask a friend something during class free time. If my school let students have their phones out in free times[Or during lunch] they'd probably become less rowdy and are less likely to text during class, for most classes have free time towards the end of class or at the beginning.

Another reason why the first policy would by more appealing is that, if you allow kids to have their phones during free time it might make them feel more at home or relaxed with the environment, so they could open their minds to learning the lessons in the classroom and text when their outside of the classroom.[Or when the lesson is done]

I believe that kids only text in class because they feel like its a normal and rebellious thing to do. They feel bored in class so they text, but if you allow texting to be allowed in classroom free times they won't feel the need to text while the teachers trying to teach, they'll just think ""Oh, I'll just text him/her during free time""

Therefore, that is why I believe in your first policy [students should be able to have their phones out during free time and lunch time only] and I hope you are convinced.

A Student",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Today i will be talking about some good reasons to join the program seagoing cowboys. i will also be trying to get people to sign up for it. I think it would be a great idea to sign up for it.

Here are some reasons why youu should sign up. You could help people out by going and helping with the food supplies, horses, cattle, youn cows, mules,and more. It would be doing a good deade too.

Another good reason is it might be a opportunity that you may never get to take again or if you wanted to try it too see if you like it.

If you are 18 though you could be drafted for military service so if u ever wanted to be apart of the military service it would be a good idea to sign up. Another good reason is if you wanted to just go and look at some new places this would be a good idea because they travel a lot and make a lot of trips.

Going on trips like this to places that need help because they just got out of worl war ll can make you see how much more help thses people need then you do. Another really good idea is that if you ever wanted a chance to help out with animals and stuff and never got a chance to this would be a good idea since they help out with all that.

In this essay i was trying to get people to sign up for seagoing cowboys. I hope the reasons i gave you was helpful enough for people to see that it would be a good idea to go and help out all the people that are in need and to help out with the food and animals and stuff.

"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:

Hey, y'all! Today I'm gonna talk about why older and younger students should be paired together. I think it's a pretty cool idea, and I'm gonna tell you why.

First of all, older students can teach younger students new things. Like, I'm in 8th grade now, but I was in 6th grade last year, so I know what it's like to be a younger student. And let me tell you, I learned a lot from my older friends. They taught me how to play new video games, how to do cool tricks on my skateboard, and even how to make better grilled cheese sandwiches. It was super helpful, and I'm sure younger students would love to learn from their older peers too.

But it's not just about learning new things. Being paired with older students can also help younger students feel more confident. Like, when I was in 6th grade, I was really shy and didn't talk much in class. But then I started hanging out with my older friend, and he would talk for me when I didn't know what to say. It made me feel so much more comfortable, and now I'm not scared to speak up in class at all. I bet younger students would feel the same way if they had older buddies to hang out with.

Another reason why older and younger students should be paired together is because it helps them understand different perspectives. Like, older students have been around longer, so they've seen more things and have more life experience. And younger students are still learning and discovering new things. When they're paired together, they can learn from each other and understand each other's viewpoints. It's like, older students can teach younger students about responsibility and independence, and younger students can teach older students about creativity and imagination.

Okay, I know some people might be thinking, ""But won't older students be bored with younger students?"" Or, ""Won't younger students be annoying to older students?"" But I think that's not fair. Older students can still learn from younger students, and younger students can still",1,llama2_chat,2
"The article ""Unmaking the Face on Mars"" explains how the Face on Mars was not made by aliens but was actually made naturally and is called a mesa. The Face was not made by aliens but does remesble a human head, the Face was also a natural landform, and the Face finally is just a mesa even though people still believe that it was created by aliens.

The Face was not created by aliens it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose eyes and a mouth. A quote from the article that supports my answer of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens and the it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose, eyes and a mouth is ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This quote supports my answer because it explains how NASA said that it was just a rock formation that resembled a human head. Another way of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all. A quote from the article that supports my answer of of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all is ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This quote from the article supports my claim of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all because it explains how the rock formation was a natural landform after further reasearch was done and revealing to the world that the Face was not an alien monument after all. Finally, not everyone was satisfied so NASA did some more research and on April 8, 2001 they took a great photo of the Face and found that it was indeed a mesa. A quote from the article that supports my asnwer of how the Face was not created by aliens but was just a butte or natural landform is "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This quote supports my answer by explaining how the Face was not alien made and was just a natural landform.

In conclusion the Face was not alien made but was just a natural landform. The Face was not created by aliens it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose eyes and a mouth. The face was also a mesa, and new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASAs Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is, a mesa. After reading my essay I want you to think about how the Face was not created by aliens but was actually created naturally. I also want you to think about all of the reasons I have stated eariler in my essay that support my claim of the Face not being created by aliens but naturally.   ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Our principle has recently stated to all the students of SCHOOL_NAME that all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity. Some students agree with this new idea and some do not. I agree with our principle that it should be mandatory to take at least one extracurricular activity. There are many activities to chose from but in my opinion, the best activities are doing the school musical, participating in a sport, and helping teachers during your spare time. Here is my reasoning.

Musical is a great extracurricular activity for students to participate in. Participating in musical gives students a chance to make friends and to get to know others. When I first moved here I did not have many friends or kids to hang out with but when I joined musical I began to meet so many people and they are considered to be my friends.

Musical allows students to get to know others and to make friends. During your time in musical you have to memorize so many things like songs, lines, and dances. When you memorize these things it allows me to memorize things in school much better. I can memorize how to perform a math equation as well as learning a song. Musical allows students to memorize things better in school just like in musical. Finally musical also gives you a great sense of confidence. When you perform a scene in front of a audience you need confidence and when practice the scene enough you get confident about it and you perform it perfectly. You can use that kind of confidence when you are taking a test/quiz cause if you studied it enough you get the confidence to do well on it. Musical can teach you how confidence works and how to gain it. Musical is a great extracurricular activity.

Another great extracurricular activity are sports! One of the main perks of playing sports is that they keep you in shape and keep you physically active. In our world today we see teens with there heads down looking at there phones but when you are playing a sport you become way more physically active. Sports allow students to be more proactive. Along with the fact of being physically active sports also allow students to think quick on there feet. When you play sports your has to think quickly which allows the brain to think faster. When I play baseball I have to think of the play quickly because if I do not think about it what will I do if the ball comes to me. So when you play sports your mind begins to think quicker which can be very helpful in school. If you need to think of a homework plan or if you need to think on if you have quizzes or tests that week use your quick thinking. Finally sports can also teach you on how to be a great leader. When you are playing a game of baseball and you are the captain and you are leading the team; you learn on what is the best play or who should go where. So sports allow you to learn how to be a good leader and with all this reasoning sports are another good extracurricular activity.

Finally another good extracurricular activity is being a TA(teachers assistant). Being a TA allows students to assist others in need. When I was a TA for Spanish I got help kids who were struggling on a worksheet or who did not word meant. Being a TA allows students to assist others who need help. Along with helping others you also get to learn what being a teacher is like and what the perks of it are. When I was a TA I learned how my teacher taught the class and what she did with students who were not doing what they were suppost to. Being a TA allows students to learn what being a teacher is like. Finally when being a TA you get to meet more students and get to know what they are like. When I walked into the class I would be helping in, I saw so many kids and got to meet so many of them and they all were cool. Being a TA is good for meeting others and it is a good extracurricular activity.

I stated in the beginning that I agree with our principle that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity. I said that due to the fact that extracurricular activitys are fun and there are many benefits. My top three activities were musical, sports, and being a TA(teachers assitant). I say that every single student in SCHOOL_NAME should do an extracurricular activity.          ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"To the Principal,

I think that policy 1 is the best choice. I think this because that's what all students from school need cell phones. The students might need cell phones because, maybe they don't know who to go with or if their mom or dad is picking them up. Another reason to bring cell phones to school is if something really bad happens in the school or to you and the office is trying to call your parents and our parents don't know the school office number, can call our parents. There are a lot of different reasons for letting students bring cell phones to school, but I only wrote the most three important, because that are some of the reasons to bring cell phones to school. The most important reason for letting students bring cell phones to school is so they can get in contact with their parents.

I also think that policy 2 is a good choice for no letting students bring cell phones to school, because if the students have their cell phones with them. the students might get distracted during class period, and not pay attention. If the principal allows students to bring cell phones to school he should led the upper grades to bring cell phones. But is the principal's decision if the students should let them bring cell phones. Policy 1 is the best choice for a principal to choose if students should bring cell phones. For some students it's important to bring their cell phones, to be in contact with their parents, or uncles. Another reason to bring cell phones to school is if we out of school super early and our parents don't know that we got out early. Those are my top reasons for letting students bring their cell phones to school.

I hope principal that you consider my opinions fro letting students bring cell phones to school or if students should not bring cell phones to school. I really think that you Mr. Principal should choose Policy 2. Thank you for your time and for reading this letter. The facts of reading this letter are so you can decide if students should bring cell phones to school. How about if you Mr. principal caught students with their cell phones during classes and if they are not paying attention you should suspend them for having their cell phones in class. Once again thank your for your time.",0,persuade_corpus,1

Some people mait want to acshuly do a extracurricular activity and thats find. Is wen the make othe people that dont want to do it , that wea i disagree.

For exampol, students can do sports. What about if they dont have the money beacus mous esports you have to but things like soccer for soccer you need soccer cleats, Or they jues dont have the healp beacau they mait be fat of someting eals so the dont have the capasati of being abol of plaing a sport.

to do a extracurricular actirity you need time. But what about if you dont have time. But what about if you can do that extracurricular activity beacus you have to go home to cean the haues.

"Research has shown that attending school can benefit students in many ways compared to completing schoolwork at home. Attending school gives students more opportunities to connect with classmates and teachers, build relationships, and benefit from better learning resources. In addition, many schools offer unique programs such as art, music, and athletics that are not typically available when studying at home. 

For students who cannot attend school due to physical or mental illness, economic reasons, or perhaps learning difficulties, there are now many options available such as online courses, alternative schools, or homeschooling. Each of these alternatives can offer students individualized learning plans, more flexibility, and tailored guidance to ensure educational success. 

While attending school and completing schoolwork at home both have distinct benefits, there are some significant differences. Attending school offers social interactions, camaraderie, faculty guidance, and access to resources that are difficult to replicate at home. Staying on track with educational goals at home requires strong self-discipline and dedication, along with an individual along with an individualized plan that suits the student’s needs.

School programs can also have a major impact on students’ learning, especially programs that emphasize different perspectives, hands-on activities, and additional resources. Furthermore, attending school increases access to technological resources such as computers and digital databases that can immensely benefit certain students. 

In conclusion, there are many benefits of attending school and completing schoolwork at home, and each environment has unique strengths to offer students. By researching the different options, students and educators will be better equipped to find an educational plan that is best for the individual.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Dear Principle,

I think you should require students to do at least an hour a week on community service because the community always needs help and who would be better to help than us students. There are always going to be people that don't want to help because they think it is a waste of time but if we don't volunteer now we are just going to be more negative about helping those in need. I think we should help the community because it is a great way to get active and help those in need. Even if donating old clothes helps it should be considered community service because it is technically helping those in need.

Another reason why we should have community service is because it promotes self-confidence and a sense of respect towards those who already help and give to the community. That is good because if you have self-confidence then it can promote you to do other good things without being told to do so (like homework). I think community service can help those in need while helping those that help the community to be better people.

We can create a list of charity events and food drives and have other people add on to that list and have kids sign up to work charity events on the school campus. To make helping out more appealing to some students we could have monthly drawings for students that did two or more hours a week to win some sort of prize. To make sure that people are doing their service we could also have reference sheets that the kids would have to fill out about what they did and have it signed by the person they worked with.

I think that requiring community service would be a great idea for students because of all the benefits to our community from picking up trash or donating clothes to starting food drives and having carnivals for children with cancer or other diseases. Our community can benefit in any way and I think this is the way to trigger the charitable acts in the students here. We have the power to help the community so will you choose to make us help or not?

"Summer is the time of the year most people enjoy. Students usually enjoy this time the most. However, there is one thing that can completely ruin it. Summer projects, something most kids would cry if they heard they had to do them. Most students show hatred towards them because it takes away from their favorite time of the year, summer! Most students forget or just chose not to complete them. Summer projects were created to keep students learning during long breaks. Teacher's usually assign these students topics. However, I believe if you give students the responsibility of choosing their own projects they would strive to complete them and mature mentally as young adults should. Student-designed projects see more completion, interest, and improvement than the average assignment. I, as a student, would want control over my project. I typically do not do as well with teacher topics as well as some of my other fellow students.

When teachers design their summer projects they use topics that fit into the lesson plan or that interest them personally. This is not fair to the student. If a student received a topic that they hated they would, more than likely, fail that project. There are a lot students who would toughen up and do the project, but most students are not like that. They will put in minimal effort towards the project just enough to pass if that. This effects grades and does not show a students true ability to perform outside the learning environment.

Humans grow in controlled situations. We as the students should be given that opportunity to grow by controlling our project. If students chose their own topics there would show a lot more effort in completion of the project. This improves the want to learn, has a better effect on grades, and learning mentality improves tremendously. Students would take more time for better results and show select skills taught by teachers, which is what teachers want to see.

I believe student-designed is the way to go. Giving us the power also gives us motivation to do it. I strive when I can do research on things I like or have a slight interest in. It is a completely different experience when you can learn about what you want to versus being in a classroom forced to learn about boring topics. For example, the American Revolution or chemical equations. By giving us topics were at an automatic disadvantage with a 32% higher chance of failure.

In other words, students have better performance with self-liked topics. Teacher-designs typically get less attention and a lot more failures from students. Finally, if you want better results from your students give them a little power every now and then. We strive in those situations made by ourselves contrasted to the ones picked out for us.",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Dear senator of Florida,

In my opinion of the Electoral College, I think we should keep it. Many people would most likely say I am wrong to think that way or I am just a kid and I have no idea what I am discussing, but I really think we should even though it has some flaws, here is my three reasons why.

First, it was established by our founding fathers. The ones who fought in battle against Britan. They sacerficed their lives to get us where we are today. Its not just a law, its what connects us to our ancestors and its what makes us unique from most nations voting systems today and back then.

Second, Though most will complain that we are not actually voting for president, but that we are putting our time and effort into voting for a slate of electors who then vote for president. Even though there is no rule against them not voting for the president of your choosing, most of them will vote for him since they are on his team and have pleged themselves to him. So really there is a very high chance of them voting for the president you want. I say they have done a very good job for such a stressing carrier.

Third, It has been going good so far. There are'nt wars taking place outside our homes like in some countries. Our Republican and Democratic parties are gracious in victory or humble in defeat. Yes there are some flaws in the system but thats just human nature. None of us are perfect and we never will be. We will make mistakes and we just got to live with them because there going to happen whether we like it or not.

This is my three major reasons why I think we should keep the Electoral College. I hope you found them intresting and will take the words to heart. Please dont tred on the fact that I am just a teen, but that there is a teen out there that actually cares about our nations future and government.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"We should keep the Electoral College because it helps the people choose a president easily then just by popular votes. The process that helps the people choose a president is easy thanks to the Electorl College. According to the source 1 ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" (source 1).

The process for Electoral College is very simple for our Nation. The process as stated is ""The Electoral College process consits of selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" (Source 1). That is why we should keep the Electoral College because the process is that simple.

The reason we shouldn't get rid of the Electoral College because just electing a President on popular votes is not far to the states that don't get to many votes. As stated in the article "" The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor."" (Source 1). The disaster that comes with the electoral college can be catastrophic.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I do not think that the new software would be of any use. Yes it is a good idea. But in the artical it gives us an example of if a student is confused or if a student looks mad or angry, the new software would explain the steps over until the student understands. The way I see it for example a student is working on a problem and the see something unusal in the problem and makes a confused face for a least a second the prgram would explain it to them. The student knows how to do the problem and knows how to solve it already but the program brought up step to exaplain it anyway. It would be useless the student could have soveld it already and would have been to the next problem but the Facial Action Coding System got in the students way just to show them how to do something they already know.

In the artical it also tells us to look in a minor or at a friend and make a ""smiling face"". The friend would see that you are happy yes, but we were told to make that face we had no desire to make that face happy or not, we just made the face, it was a forced smile. In the artical also it says that the computer program would be able to tell a force smile from a genuingly happy smile which what I just explaind that a smile is easy to manipulate. The program could be taking in false information and the program itself would not even know it.

In the artical it also exaplains that ads. That if a ad were to pop up and you would smile the prgram would show another ad just like the previous one and visvursa. The real question is have you ever ever seen a ad so many times that you become angry or frustrated and you smile because the ""Skip ad"" timer is getting closer and closer to zero the ""FAC"" would miss-understand your face and bring another ad just like that one. With this program I see very many problems that would not be able to be avoided.

""The new emotion-recognition software tracks facial movements!"" Oh great but world class actors and actresses and pull the fake emotions off like no other. Some people dont show emotion and sometimes can be happy but no show it. with all these muscles in your face it could also mean that the face tracker would miss lead the face expressions. You as might as well have a dog look at you and be able to tell if your happy or not, becuase they are much better at reading face expressions.

It is a really good idea but it can be easily manipulated and also be in the way of varius things. I think it would be much much easier if you were to raise your hand and ask for help or just click a button that has different emotions that you could choose from to tell how you are feeling.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Driverless cars would be a helpful tool in the future. They could help us get things done while heading somewhere far away. It could get rid of driver errors. Drunk driving could even by stop by this new product. This is why the driverless car should be allowd.

First off the time you use to drive all the way down to Florida is about 12-18 hours. Lets say someone is going there for their job that 12-18 hours could be used for all sorts of things like making up for you job while your away or just finshing a project you did for this meet. It would be a great way to use your time instead of having to drive. This could be an amazing break through for somepeople who have to travel many times for their job.

Secondly, if we have only driverless cars all driving they would know how to react to each other. This inturn would get rid of driver error such as drivers getting angry at each other. Another example would be cars speeding past each other, which cause recks. Driverless cars could bring down the death toll from car crashs every year by getting rid of driver error.

Finally, a big problem today is drunk driving. If we had driverless cars the drunk drivers would never have to touch the wheel making the roads safer. The car its self could never get drug or slow down its reaction speed making it safer than with someone above .08. This could also bring down the death toll, for drunk driving crashs every year.

These are all reasons i believe that we could be better of with driverless cars. It may cost more and their might be problems at first but in the long run it could save many of lives. Many states do not trust it, but i believe after they make they cars smarter they will see that they can driver better than any human ever could. Saving lives for many people which if worth it.

"""when people ask for advice the usually talk to more than one person""

\reasons why talking to more than one person is good:

you get more opinions you have more options you have more of an opportunity to get it accomplished because the more you talk about it the more stress it releases things that need to be included to get good advice:

full story how it all started even the part that makes you look bad the problem things that you can get advice about:

how to prevent a fight how to do better on a test how to strive to your goals life lessons how to solve a problem with the advice you get:

listen and take the advice step by step don't be nervous be positive stay away from the drama when asking for advice talk to more that one person because it helps make better decisions because all the advice you get will help you because you have more opinions to choose from.

when people ask for advice they usually talk to more than one person because it helps them make better decisions because they get more advice from more people. Everyone has different opinions so when you talk to more than one person it helps out because you have a lot of different opinions. when i ask for advice i like to be able to talk to more than one person because then i have a variety of opinions to choose from. Asking for advice does not always mean that you have to talk to more than one person because everybody has different opinions. some people think that you should not believe other people's opinion ans others believe you should listen to people's opinions.

when you talk to people for advice it helps you release more stress and make good decisions. It can also help you make a better choice because when you talk to someone for advice you look up to them. therefore if they are making good decisions they will inspire you to make good decisions also. when asking for advice don't just ask any random person ask like a family member, or friend, or teacher,counselor,principal at school. be careful who you ask for advice and share your information with because if you do it online then you could think it was your friend but could be a stranger on their account.

If you ever share any information or problems with the wrong person they could spread the rumor around your whole school,social media, and your outside life. only ask for advice and share your problems with people you can trust but be careful because anybody could turn their back on you. when asking for advice you have to be specific with what you need advice about. therefore that means tell all the details and dont leave anything out tell the full story. when getting advice a bout a problem that is going on,to get the best advice you must tell the full story and tell the things that make you look bad too.

Even though that it makes you look bad and shows that you mad bad choices it helps get better advice. When you tell the full story and the bad side that makes you look bad people understand because nobody is perfect everybody makes bad decisions. making bad decision is not always bad if you are doing it to help yourself or someone. but if you make a bad decision like just punch someone in the face then you should be in trouble. some advice you could get for a fight or something that was not your fault is like just walk away and go tell an adult,or just try to push them away but don't harm them,but if you accidentally punch them back but that is not your fault because you were just trying to defend yourself.

after getting advice for a problem try to solve the problem with the advice you got. when trying to resolve the problem after getting advice try to stop the drama not make more. first way to solve a problem,walk up to the person and say sorry. second way you could do it is like,hey can we just end the drama because there is no point of it. then if that does not work just don't talk to that person or anyone who is going to get you in that situation again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

Firstly I believe that you should allow students to have their phones during lunch periods and other free times.

I believe this, because when I went to SCHOOL_NAME for my seventh grade year we were allowed to have our phones during lunch and other free time as long as it was in are lockers during classes.

Also then if students needed to call their parents to come and get during the school day when they couldn't remember their parents number, they could get a hold of them.

Secondly when students are allowed to have their phones during lunch and other free time the students most likely to keep their phones in their lockers during classes, because when I went to SCHOOL_NAME the student who had phones in class was less.

That was a good thing so the teachers could go through all the lessons they had planned for this class period.

And thirdly then there was less students getting in trouble, and less cell phones getting taken away from the students.

That is why I believe that student should be allowed their phone during lunch and other free times, thank you for your time.

"Dear state senator,

I wish to inform you about my opinion and another 60 percent of voters opinions about the Electoral college. We suggest that instead of voting for a state of electors we should vote directly to the president that we wish would lead our country. People wan't to vote straight fowardly to the exact person they perfer and not to electors whom the people can't control who they decide to vote for. Some electors have refused to vote for their party's canidate and vote for whoever they wanted to instead. Many people often get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. We also cannot choose who the electors are.

We know that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that the electors that they choose always defy the will of the people. Many things can go wrong when we use electors. They could cheat into getting who they want to win. Just like how in 1960, the segregationists the the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in their dirty plan to replace the democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy meaning that they tried to get the popular vote that was for him to actually not get to Kennedy. Also, a state might send two slates of electors to congress. It's happened in Hawaii in 1960, what makes you think it won't happen again?

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of all the ways electors cheat to make sure who they wan't wins. Canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all. Also 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see any campaign adds and its because of the winner-take-all system in each state.

We suggest to changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. The citizens of the United states should be able to vote for the president that they perfer and not for an elector that could ditch the original idea and vote for only their personal opinion. There would be less flaws in the presidential electing process if we accept the popular vote method.             ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some schools require students to complete a summer project.

In my personal the students should dictate the -summer project.

For the finale, students know what they are capable of.

To begin, the students need to enjoy their summer break.

Summer break is meant to be a break from school, with the thought of a mandatory project ruines the fun of summer break.

With a project on there minds it becomes hard to just relax with the constant threat of failure.

In continuation, students know how much time they have to work.

students may go on trips during the summer and may not have time to complete a project by a teacher's design.

Students could schedule better if the students decided, their prior knowledge would be a deciding factor.

only they know what they have time to do.

For the finale, students know what they are capable of.

Some students may not have the means to complete a project.

For example, if the project is to go someplace a student might not have a vehicle or parents willing to help.

Students may not be able to multitask for projects.

"Dear Principal,

I think that the new regulation of only being able to participate in sports or other after school activities if you have at least a b average is a good idea. Kids need to get there grades up and in high school you are not allowed to be on a team unless you keep up your grades so teaching them to do that know is a grate idea. That way by the time we get to high school we will be used to that staidly of only being able to do the other activities if we keep our grades up to standard.

Another good thing about this policy is that less kids will be goofing off during class and more will be concentrated on there work and studies so that they will get at least a b average so that they can be able to do the things that they would like. More kids will make principles honor roll or even just honor roll and will be able to take higher classes because they are keeping there grades up.

That will also better prepare us for the rest of our life. When we are looking to go to collage most collages want people with better grades than a c average so because of this rule we will start getting into the habit of getting those good grades and hopefully that will carry on with us threw out high school and even on. Once we go on and get a job we will ( or at least most of us) still have the same work ethic and will work hard and do well. Instead if this was never a rule some of us would have never had to try to get a better than a c average or have a better work ethic.

"Imagine it is the last day of school and the dismissal bell rings. You run out of your classroom knowing you will you will not have to worry about a teacher's assignment for the next three months. The only assignment you have is a project that is in your complete control. Some would say a student-designed summer project will not benefit the projects educational purpose because students would pick the easiest projects but that is not the case. Students should should design there own summer projects because they can be creative and not feel the burden of a forced teacher-designed project.

If the summer project is student-designed than this will allow creativity and make the project more fun. Students can even insert their summer activities into the project. Wouldn't it be better to have a project that feels like a summer activity? Having been in the school system for about 11 years, students know that a student-designed project allows them to be more creative and to think about ways to make the project fun. Students like the idea of choosing how they work on assignments and having a project over the summer is already annoying enough. Choosing how you do the project over vacation, however, encourages creativity and motivation to actually do the project.

As teenagers, being told to wash the dishes or do the laundry makes us less motivated to do them because we do not always like being told what to do. But when we do them voluntarily, we feel encouraged to do more than if asked. Same goes with school projects. Knowing you are forced to work on a project that has all the requirements laid out can feel like a burden. The projects aspects may not be your strong suit but, if you have the project in your control than you feel more motivated to work on it. You can inset your strong ideas that you know you can work best on.

Some would say a teacher-designed summer project allows for better learning because teachers know more, but a student-designed summer project will let students not only learn more but be more creative and motivated to work. Having a required assignment over the summer is annoying enough so, letting students design their projects lifts some weight off their shoulders. Students should not have to feel the burden of a teacher-designed project over the break but rather the creativity they have on how they choose to learn. Now imagine it is the middle of summer and you know your required summer project is going to be designed by you. There is no worries, just a mind full of creative ideas. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The author gives many reasons why we should study venus despite the dangers it present. He give also a lot of information for why the planet does not have a good environment. He also list so of th dangers that are there for people and how it could effect them if they traveled to this planet. Like how 97% of the planets atomsphere in carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid.

One reason that the author gives NASA has a possible solution to the hostile conditions. The author says "" Imagine a blimp-like vehical hovering 30 or some miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". Like the Jet airplanes today it would travel at high altitude to fly over the dangerous air conditions. But every 30 mile above the temperatureis still a toasty 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

Another reason that the author gives is NASA is working on other way to study Venus. The author says ""Some simlified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"". Would the machine give workers the time they needed to study the thing the need.

The last reason that the author gives looking back on old technology called mechanical computers. The authors says "" these devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War 2"". The thought was computers existing in those days may sound shocking, But these devices make calculations by using gears abd levels. Modern computers are powerful quick and flexible but are delicate.

"I think the reason people ask multiple people for advice. My reasons are 1. It might help them make better choices in the decision they are trying to take.2. It could give them a broader view on things.3. You might want to see if ever thing that the one person said would be the right thing to do. Lets get in to the reasons why i think people ask for advice from multiple people

Reason one. If you get advice from multiply people about a job or what college you should go to. The person asking wants to ask a lot of people because. they want to know why should i not go to these school or why should i get these job. They dont really know what they want thats why. they ask multiple peoples advice it will give them a better view on what they should do. When i ask people what do you think that i should do you think i should go to this or not go thats getting there side of view.

Reason two. It could give you a lot broader view or better prospective on things. Some times people will ask multiply people because. they want to see both sides of things they dont want to be tunnel vision on one idea. When someone is just tunnel vision on one idea. they usually dont make the best desion because they cant see if they like the other side or not.

Reason three. If one person tells you to go to something and your not so shore what would you do. Would you do what the person told you to do or would you ask around. I know i would ask people what i should do because if you dont and you make a bad dession that could ruing your life for ever. So that is why people ask more than one person about a idea.

These are the reasons why you should ask multiply people about a topic or a choice in life. You dont know may the one person you ask might set you up for a road. that could make you a millionaire or it could set you up to a path that you might not want to go down. which is OK you should hopefully learn from your mistakes.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Do you think Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers? I think it can worth it because it is one of the planets that is close to us (Earth). Venus is sometimes called ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. The things I will get to tell you will explode your mind about Venus.

First, Venus is very dangerous to visit. For example, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus`s atmosphere.

In fact, scientists are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ao, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can sometimes be our neaarest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.

Finally, NASA is working on other approchaes to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus`s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II. These calcualtions by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

In conclusion, these are all the details on how Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They have a lot of factors that makes it so much fun to learn despite it`s danger. Scientist will find a way to reach Venus and study it for years to come. Would you ever study Venus after reading this?",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Self-esteem is an important part of a healthy and happy life. It allows us to confidently face challenges, be resilient in the face of difficulties, and trust in our abilities. Self-esteem is particularly key in developing successful relationships, as it provides us with the ability to make meaningful connections with others. Without sufficient self-esteem, it is difficult to make the most of our lives.

Real achievement can help improve self-esteem since it allows us to connect with our goals and regain confidence in ourselves. When we make meaningful progress towards a goal, it is an important reminder that we are capable and capable of great things. In this way, real achievement helps to boost our self-esteem and give us the confidence to tackle new challenges.

The opinions of others can affect our self-esteem. In the digital age, it is all too easy to compare ourselves to others. This can lead to a deep sense of inadequacy if we judge ourselves harshly in comparison to others. It is important that we take the time to reflect on our own goals and celebrate our progress. We should try not to be overly influenced by the opinions of others and keep our focus on the progress we have made.

Ultimately, the key to better self-esteem lies in being ourselves. When we are our true selves and remain authentic, it is easier to take ownership of our successes and be proud of ourselves. Being yourself is about giving yourself the freedom to be exactly who you are, without worrying what the world thinks of you. With this freedom comes increased self-esteem, allowing you to make the most of your life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"There are numerous mysteries of the world that mankind is only on the verge of solving.

From Stonehenge to the Great Pyramids of Giza, historians as well as the public has a surplus of both logical and outrageous theories as to where these icons began.

One example of this is the Face on Mars.

The Face has become a symbol of its own and many believe there to be a correlation with alien life.

However, I, as a scientist, am certain that the Face is simply a natural landform rather than an alien creation due to my knowledge that NASA has taken multiple pictures of the formation and reached this conclusion, NASA has no logical reason to hide evidence if it were present, and because planet Earth has similar formations found in nature.

In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor or MGS image depicted a shocking sight for those down on Earth.

According to ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", an article discussing the mysterious Face, ""...it[Viking 1] spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.""

After their initial reactions, the rational scientists arrived at the conclusion that the sight was in reality, ""...just another Martian mesa"".

They carried on to unveil the finding to the public who some of whom responded claiming the Face is certain proof of Martian life.

NASA has stood by their belief, taking numerous shots of the Face since the original spotting.

As recently as of April 8, 2001; newer photographs using the newest techonology have shown the Face for what it really is.

Jim Garvin, the chief scientist of the Mars Exploration Program, describes tthe intent saying, ""We felt this was important to taxpayers.

We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.

The clarity of these recent pictures is much improved upon those shot by the 1976 Viking.

In fact Garvin again claims, So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

True scientists understand that in order to prove a theory valid, one must utilize multiple data collections rather than one outlier.

NASA has indeed done so in the case of the Face on Mars.

Another reason for believing what I do is the fact that NASA is a professional organization which of course seeks funding and a fair reputation as much as anyone else.

Although many conspiracy theorists claim ""NASA would rather hide"" evidence of life on Mars, this could not be farther from the truth.

According to the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

This is completely logical as recently funding for NASA has only decreased, seemingly along with the public's interest in space exploration.

This being the case, why on Earth would it be sensible for NASA to attempt any sort of cover up regarding evidence of alien life such as the alleged Face on Mars?

Finally, to verify NASA's knowledge that the Face is just a natural landform, is the observation which no one can deny: our planet Earth is abundant in formations such as the Face.

In fact, the mesa which the Face really is, is fairly similar to those found on Earth.

These landforms are particularly common is the western region of North America.

In fact, Jim Garvin states, It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Although Mars and Earth differ is many ways, the two neighboring planets share similar land formations such as these.

The Face is but a specific example of this.

After examining NASA's numerous verification attempts through the means of photography, the fact that NASA has no known motive to hide the alleged ""evidence"", and observing our own planet and its characteristics, it is clear to see that the Face is indeed nothing more than a naturally-occuring landform.

Undeniably fascinating, the Face on Mars is similar to many other wonderous works of nature.

As humans, it is only natural to find these perplexing and interesting.

However, science should not be refuted by simple fascination.

Instead, science should be utilized as a tool to explain the source of these out-of-this-world discoveries.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Senator,

I know that you have many issues to think about and havee a lot of decisions to make, but I think it the subject of the Electoral College is a very improtant subject for you to ponder.  The Electoral College needs to be changed, we need to vote for the presidency with the popular vote.  I believe that the Electoral college needs to be taken away because it's not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.

First, the Electoral College should be changed because it is not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College.  The people ar evoting for the president, but not really.  They are actually voting for a slate of electors, who then choose what canidate there electoral votes should go to.  The whole point of a democracy is to let the people of the country have a say in who is in charge, but with the Electoral College this is not happening. The people are saying who they want for president but if the slate of electors does not agree, then the votes go the other way.  This was expressed in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer.  In the passage he says, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for aslate of elctors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for insatnce, and wanted to vote for John Kerrry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes.""

In addition, the Electoral College should be abolished because the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate. The Legislature is technically responsible for picking electors and theycould very well pick electors that are all against a certain candidate. Everyone says the system is so strong but is it really? The fact that a group of people opposing one candidate could be the electors for that state and could totally changed the votes doesn't make the system look so strong. Plummer adressed this situation in his passage, he stated, ""Back in 1960, segregationista in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors wiht new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (so that the popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy).""

Finally, the Electoral college system needs to be taken away because it is very confusing. The whole system is just a jumble of different things. There are so many different steps and processes that tend to confuse the voters. When the voters get confused they often end up voting for the wrong candidate or making a mistake. If the voting system was just, the voters voted for who they pleased, then the votes were counted, then all the votes from states are added together, and then whoever had the most votes won, the whole thing would just be much easier.  I belive that when the situation is as impportant as voting for our president, it should be as easy and flawless as possible.  For example, when I was in seventh grade, I learned about the Electoral College in civics class. learing about the Electoral College was one of the hardest and most complicated thing I learned that year. How are people supossed to vote, if they have no idea how the system works?

In conclusion, I believe that the electoral college needs to be abolished because it's not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.

"One of the benefits of having a four-day school week with ten hours of school each day is the amount of time students would have for outside activities and enrichment. With two extra days per week free from having to attend classes, students would have the opportunity to explore interests, get a job, volunteer, or participate in sports or extracurricular activities. This extra free time could result in increased academic performance, improved mental wellbeing, and a more well-rounded student body.

On the other hand, having ten hours of school per day could be a detriment to student performance. Students would be required to focus for an extended period of time, which may not be conducive to learning. Additionally, students may not have enough outside time to participate in activities that could benefit their academic performance.

"I am against the development of driverless cars for many reasons. Personally I feel as though people are starting to get more and more lazy these days with the help of technology. I believe it would be much more safe for someone to manually drive a car, rather than put your trust into a computer. There is a wide range of possibilities that could go wrong with driverless cars out on the roads.

My first reason is that the car could malfunction. Whoever programmed the car could have messed up and gave the car a defect. Then someone would buy that defected car and most likely get into a crash. Someone could be on a highway while the car system fails, crashing into a semi truck. Theres a possibility that the car could completely shut off, leaving you stranded in the middle of nowhere. Also GPS these days isn't very reliable, the car could take you completely off route trying to follow GPS.

My second reason is that someone could hack your cars system. Somebody that strongly dislikes you could get in your car and ruin its system. Even worse, people would start paying a hacker to destroy car systems. While you're out on the road relaxing in your driverless car, a hacker could take control of your car giving it directions. That means while your stuck in your car, someone is in control of your life deciding if they want to crash your car.

My third reason is that it's not very safe. I don't think putting all of your trust into a vehicle is a very smart idea. The sensor on the car could go out with your knowledge, causing it to crash. There could be road construction that the car is not aware of, potentially driving straight into the construction site. Your city might have certain driving regulatons that the car won't know about, which could give you a ticket from a cop.

My fourth reason is that you could be put at a higher risk of getting in a car accident. What if a little boy is getting his ball in the road? The car might not see him with the sensors, causing the car to drive right into the boy. You could be texting on your phone and then out of no where a car is comming right towards you. It's too late to gain control of the car because you were so busy texting, resulting in a car crash. Maybe you're tired so you take a nap while your car is on its way to the casino. Your car could crash at any moment, because you're not awake and not paying attention to the road.

In conclusion, there are multiple reasons why a driverless car wouldn't be safe. whether it's due to a malfunction, hacker, or even safety issues driverless cars are not safe. I hope after reading this you realize there are way more cons than pros with driverless cars. It's better to do things right by yourself, rather than putting your trust into technology.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Facial expressions have been our way of communicating without talking. Its a silent way of showing how you feel about something or someone. Knowing what expressions are being shown towards an action you do is important. If you yell at someone, they might make an angry or upset face. After seeing that expression, most people will most likely never repeat that action again. In class rooms its hard sometimes as a teacher to teach and notice if everyone is catching along or if the subject is too boring. Having this new technology used to read students expressions is a valuable tool because it lets teachers know if they should continue or stop and help students out.

Many of us have been in the situation were your in class and it is boring. The class feels like 3 hours long and the teacher is into their subject and just does not stop talking. They do not switch things up and not many kids are paying any attention at all. With the help of this technology, which reads students facial expression, it can let teachers know its time to switch things up or move on.

The next class might be much easier to get through and maybe towards the end, be your favorite. Teachers and professors will see what students like best and what they find interesting and develope new and better strategies; or computors will just as Dr. Huang predicts in the 6th paragraph, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human intructor.

Many students also struggle in school. "" A classroom computor could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Students tend to try and be independent or just don't want to ask for help in fear of being made fun of. In some cases many students are confused but refuse to ask for help. With the detector, teachers could ask students if they need help or what they are not understand in class. All helping to prevent students from getting lost or struggling in any subject. Teachers could be doing a better job by understanding the students, and the students too,would feel better knowing that someone knows what they need help in and is coming up with a better teaching plan.

Technology is advancing more and more each day. In no time, we will improve schools and work areas. The way we communicate will better and the way we read expressions will too. As said in paragraph 8 ""to an expert, faces don't lie: these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isnt being truthful""; the same could be applied to students. Facial expressions are important. With these computors or devices put in every class room, students will soon be performing at their top best. Soon enought the decives will be used in work areas, while texting and more.   ",0,persuade_corpus,0

"First impressions are the initial thoughts and feelings that we have about someone or something when we first meet them. These impressions can have a significant impact on our relationships with others. In this essay, I will explore how first impressions can affect relationships and provide examples of both positive and negative experiences related to first impressions.

First impressions can have a positive impact on relationships when they are based on mutual respect and understanding. For example, when two people meet for the first time and both feel comfortable and at ease with each other, they are more likely to develop a positive first impression. This can lead to a stronger and more meaningful relationship in the future. Additionally, when people have similar interests or values, they may form a positive first impression and develop a stronger bond.

On the other hand, first impressions can also have a negative impact on relationships when they are based on prejudice or bias. For example, if someone makes a negative first impression based on a person's race, gender, or religion, it can lead to a strained or uncomfortable relationship. This can happen even if the person later learns to overcome their biases and develop a more positive relationship with the person.

Another example of a negative first impression is when someone misinterprets the intentions of another person. For instance, if someone assumes that another person is not interested in them or does not like them based on their initial behavior or appearance, it can lead to a negative first impression and damage the relationship.

In conclusion, first impressions can have a significant impact on relationships. Positive first impressions can lead to stronger and more meaningful relationships, while negative first impressions can damage or strain relationships. It is important to be aware of our own biases and assumptions and to strive for mutual respect and understanding when meeting new people. By doing so, we can develop positive first impressions and build stronger relationships with those around us.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"A student presents their self-designed science project: it is a box of dry ice and a research paper on the properties of the peculiar substance. The project has a valid topic, but it is almost irrelevant to the curriculum of the class. A month later, the student realizes that the summer project should have been some sort of a review of the graphing unit last year---which they had forgotten completely. A summer project is meant to preserve the necessary knowledge from the year before and to prepare the student for the upcoming year. If the project's design includes and practices irrelevant information, then its purpose is completely undermined. In order to avoid this, a summer project should be designed by teachers instead of students because they know the curriculum well, will take it seriously, and can use it as an opportunity to set the expectations for the upcoming school year.

It is most logical and effective for a teacher to design summer projects. As the people who teach the class, teachers are the ones who will know what skills the students must practice in order to succeed in the class.

Therefore, there is no one better fit to prepare the students than the teacher. Only they have the knowledge and expertise to coordinate what the class will require and what the students will be able to give. In Michigan, a student designed a summer project for math, but upon arrival to school, they realize that they focused on the least prevalent and useful topic. It would have been considerably more beneficial to the student if the project were designed according to the curriculum of the class. However, the students simply do not know the curriculum like the teachers do. If they have never taken the class, they would not know what they supposed to focus on for a summer assignment. The teacher, however, would and should be the one to design summer projects.

A student would not treat a summer project with as much seriousness as a teacher would. Through observation, it can be seen that the majority of the teen population does not stay ambitious or dedicated to school during the summer time. Due to this, it makes no sense why teachers would trust students to dedicate their time and effort into designing a well-thought out project instead of dismissing it so that they may enjoy their summer. Teens want to forget about school as summer time comes around, they do not want to spend it preparing for more school. For instance, if a student has the choice between an easy project or a truly helpful, but complicated and tedious project, observation shows that they are most likely to choose the easier option. Teachers should design the project because they would not be as tempted to simplify the project for the sake of their own self desires like students may. In the earlier situation, teachers would most likely choose the harder project because they know it would benefit the students in the long run. Since teachers would be more responsible and serious with the project, they are the ideal designers for it.

A summer project would show students what to expect during the school year if they were designed by teachers. For example, a highly detailed and extensive project would indicate a rigorous class. The projects are an opportunity for teachers to introduce and exemplify the expectations of the students---in this case, high expectations. This sneak peek into class life would hopefully prevent unpreparedness from students and help the class run more smoothly. Teacher-designed projects have also been shown to benefit students by preventing a switch of classes during the school year: a junior at Generic_School decides to switch out of her Spanish 5 class during the summer after attempting the summer assignment. If it were designed by the teacher, it would be just like assignments from the class itself. This demonstrates the advantage of having the opportunity to work on an assignment that mirrors the work done in a possible class: a student essentially gains the ability to do a test run to see if they like it or not. That junior would have gotten stuck in the class and performed poorly if it were not for the summer assignment. Therefore, summer assignments should be designed by teachers to give students an idea of what to expect and what is expected of them.

Teachers are the best fit to design summer assignments for students because, unlike teens with only fun and relaxation on their minds who would not take the project seriously, teachers can create an assignment that will prepare the student for the specified curriculum and demonstrate what they expect from them. This should have tremendous benefits when it comes to student preparedness, class switches, and student success. A student-designed project may sound like a good idea because it opens up the opportunity for students to be creative and show what they know, however, in reality, most students simply will not put enough effort into it. Perhaps if teenagers were more passionate about school during the summer it would work, but until then, teachers remain the best candidate for designing summer assignments.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"As an 8th grader, I have been thinking a lot about my future and what I want to do after high school. Some people might think that graduating early is a good idea, but I'm not so sure.

One advantage of graduating early is that you get to explore different career paths before everyone else. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you can take some college classes and get a head start on your education. Or, if you want to be an artist, you can take some art classes and get a feel for what it's like to be in college. This can be really helpful because you can figure out what you want to do and what you're good at before everyone else does.

Another advantage is that you get to take some extra classes and get a head start on your education. This can be really helpful if you want to get into a good college or if you want to learn something new. For example, you can take a math class or a science class and get a better understanding of the material before everyone else.

But there are also some disadvantages to graduating early. One of the biggest disadvantages is that you might not be ready for the workload of college. College is a lot harder than high school, and if you're not used to it, you might struggle to keep up. Additionally, you might not have as much time to relax and have fun, which can be really important for your mental health.

Another disadvantage is that you might miss out on some important experiences that you would have if you stayed in high school for another year. For example, you might not have as much time to hang out with your friends or to participate in extracurricular activities. This can be really sad because you might miss out on some of the best times of your life.

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to graduating early, there are also some disadvantages. It's important to think carefully about your decision and make sure that you're ready for the challenges of college before you decide to graduate early.",1,llama2_chat,2
"As an 8th grader, I strongly believe that taking good care of a dog is super important. First of all, you gotta feed your dog a nutritious meal every day. That means no more giving them table scraps or junk food. They need good stuff like chicken, beef, or veggies to keep them healthy and strong. My dog, Max, loves his kibble, but he also loves when I give him treats like carrots or apples. They're good for him and they make him happy!

Next, you gotta make sure your dog has plenty of water. In the summer, it's important to give them cool water so they don't get too hot. My mom always fills up Max's water bowl outside so he can drink it in the shade. In the winter, it's important to give them regular water so they don't get dehydrated from the cold weather. My dog loves to drink from his big, stainless steel bowl. It's like his favorite thing in the world!

After your dog has eaten and drunk enough water, it's time for a walk! Taking your dog on walks is so much fun. Max loves to run around and sniff all the interesting smells. He's like a little detective! And it's good for him too because it helps him get some exercise and use the bathroom. My mom always puts Max's leash on and we go for a walk around the neighborhood. It's like a special bonding time for us.

Of course, spending time with your dog is super important too. You gotta give them lots of love and affection. My mom always gives Max belly rubs and scratches behind the ears. He loves it so much! It's like he's the happiest dog in the world. And it's not just about the treats and attention, it's about making sure they feel loved and part of the family. My dog is like my best friend, and I couldn't imagine life without him.

Another thing you gotta do is provide your dog with toys. My dog loves to chew on his squeaky balls and chase after his favorite toy",1,llama2_chat,2
"Dear principle,

I disagree with your idea to require students to participate in community services. In my opinion we should have a choice in those sorts of things. Not only that but, what about homework, family, and other school or home related activities? There are some up sides to that idea and i understand that it would help the environment and make the neighborhood look a lot better. But, what about what the children want? I'm positive that there are some students that may want to do that and that is great. Let those individuals choose what they would like to do. For example, someone might need some extra credit and they could do the community service to earn that. Another idea is to make that an extra activity like sports or band. When would the students have time for the community service? Would it be during or after school? In my point of view either way would be interfering with either grades or home.

I'm sure that a majority of the student body will agree with me on these matters. I'm just saying it would be best to allow the students themselves choose what they want to do. Then there will have to be parents involved too. You would need their permission for their kids to do community service.

How about you hold a vote? Then you can see some willing participants. You could also send home a question form for the parents to find out their point of view. Either way you may end up with a few people that will agree with you. Well that's all my opinion on this matter. If I gave you some ideas then perfect. But if not then i guess i gave it my best shot. Well, whatever you do is up to you. I hope you will consider a few things I mentioned. But as I said, it may collide with home and at school as well.

"Greetings! I have heard that you think the Face on Mars, is a face that was created by aliens. I believe that this ""face"" is just a natural landform. I will support my claim why I think this, and maybe you will finally believe, that there are no such things as aliens.

There are many reasons why the Face is just a natural landform. On the second sentence paragraph, it says that we scientists have figured that the Face was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only that this one had unusual shadows, which made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. The reason some people think it look like an alien, was because it looked like a real face, but it looks like a face, because the shadows formed on the rock give off illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth. On paragraph 7, it is said that Machael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the origninal Viking phots. Later on, thoughsands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to appear. When it finally did, the site revealed a natural landorm. People were not satisfied, because it was a cloudy day on Mars. The scientists decided to prove that it was just a landform, so when it was not cloudy, they took another picture. In the final paragraph, paragraph 12, it says that what the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a btte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. A man name Garvin says, ""That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The lava dome is most of Middle Butte in the Snake Riber Plaint of Idaho.

So, in conclusion, if you first thought that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, than I hope I have gave your enough information, and persuaded you that it is really just a natural landform. I am sorry if you thought it was made by aliens, but it wasn't. I hope that you could understand, and see that it was just the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Treating people with respect, regardless of age, country, or religion, is an essential aspect of life. Respect is a fundamental human right that should be given to everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. When we treat people with respect, we acknowledge their inherent worth and dignity, and we create a positive and supportive environment for them to thrive.

One of the reasons why respect is essential to succeed in life is that it helps us build strong relationships. When we treat people with respect, we show them that we care about them and value their opinions. This creates a sense of trust and mutual understanding, which is essential for any successful relationship. For example, if you treat your colleagues with respect, they will be more likely to work collaboratively with you and support your ideas. This can lead to better teamwork, increased productivity, and ultimately, success in your career.

Another reason why respect is crucial to success in life is that it helps us develop empathy. When we consider someone's feelings, even if we are not in a good mood, we demonstrate that we understand and care about them. This can help us build stronger connections with people and make us more effective communicators. For example, if you treat your parents with respect, they will be more likely to listen to your concerns and offer guidance and support when you need it. This can help you navigate the challenges of growing up and ultimately, succeed in life.

Our attitude towards people around us can also lead to beneficial or negative outcomes. When we treat people with respect, we create a positive and supportive environment that can lead to success. On the other hand, when we treat people with disrespect or contempt, we create a negative and hostile environment that can lead to conflict and failure. For example, if you treat your classmates with disrespect, they may be less likely to work with you on group projects or participate in class discussions. This can lead to poor academic performance and ultimately, failure to succeed in school.

In conclusion, treating people with respect, regardless of age, country, or religion, is essential to succeed in life. Respect helps us build strong relationships, develop empathy, and create a positive and supportive environment. Our attitude towards people around us can lead to beneficial or negative outcomes, and it is up to us to choose how we treat others. By treating people with respect, we can create a world that is more peaceful,",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"My position on driverless cars is that I'm against with the driverless cars, because in paragraph 9 it said that it's waiting on the law. It talks about that most laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, but what ""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?""

It going to take forever to figure out to se who fault it is, because 1 is going to be driver he didn't react fast enough and didn't try to stop it or just becasue is the owner's car is going to be the owner fault in paragrpah 7 said that manufacturers are considering putting cameras to watch drivers to remaining focused on the road, but there going to be some people that are going to agruement about privary with the camera in the car. Manufacturer is going to be there fault for not checking the technology to see if they will work. That something tht the supreme court or court doesn't what to go through. It sounds like a good idea to help the environment, would you less fossil fuel but there are still risk that can happen with the technology.

The introduction of this article about Driverless Cars Are Coming talks about how if you can see the future where no one buys cars. Well the Google cofounder Sergey Brin is trying to do see the future with public transportation system that are driveless.

Sensing the World in the late 1950s General Motors created a car that could run on a special test track, but how is it going to help in the open road with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car on each highway that the only why that car would be able to run. In the the smart road systems it worked but they need a lot of upgrades to existing roads, something that is to much to pay for. Without the smart road there is no driverless car on the road.

Driving or Assisting is talks about the antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream calling a cab that is driverless, but in the article Driverless Cars are coming to that 2013 BMW said that had devloped a system called the Traffic Jam Assistant that it help the car be handle driving the right speed up to 25 miles per hour.

On the driverless car they can do is they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they have not meet the human skills, like driving through work zones and around accidents.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Some may say right now, at the start of 2015, the whole world is at a peak for technology, cars, and advancements. Some are saying differently. In this day and age, many countries, also can't afford any more pollution than they already have, due to how many vehicles there are on the road. Some cities have even stopped using cars all together, and have been very sucessful. All of these reasons help further prove the point of how limiting car usage could really be an advantage in today's society.

Are the peak of vehicles in the United States over? In the past, people predicted flying cars for 2015, but no one predicted a downfall in vehicles all together. Elisabeth Rosenthal states, ""the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily after... As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the contry was in January 1995."" So overall, less driving seems to becoming a trend.

Pollution caused by the gas of cars is a huge issue in today's society. Some cities are finally taking action.

"Dear Principal,

I don't believe that all students should be forced to do community service.

It's a great thing to do for our community, but not everyone should be forced to do it.

To begin children would resent having to do it.

They wouldn't try their hardest to help the environment.

They would just be being forced to do it, so most people would hate it and either try to get out of it, or just hardly do anything.

The whole point of community service is to help out your community however, if you just have a bunch of kids there that would much rather be at home or with their friends than that defeats the purpose.

Instead of having a lot of unwilling kids doing community service it would be much more effective to have a handful of students that really are willing and interested in helping out in their community.

Although it's sad that not all kids want to help out, their still are a good amount that would be interested.

All people are different, whether it's in appearance or personality.

They completely are different.

Some kids would rather spend their time at home playing video games all day and others would rather help out in the community.

It's nice to think that all children would like to help out with everything but it's just not realistic.

All of humanity is different, if you forced someone who loves say art to be a fireman or woman they most likely wouldn't enjoy it.

Kids want to do things that they really enjoy and if community service isn't it than they won't apply themselves.

Another very important reason, is that students are already so extremely busy.

If you put on another thing to do they will get stretched to thin and not be able to keep up with other things that they have to do.

As students get older they get more and more homework and projects that they really need to focus on.

Not only that, is the fact that after school many people do various sports, arts, etc. that require a lot of their time.

At our age we're trying to figure out what we want to do with our lives and though community service is a great opportunity and just an excellent thing to do, it's not always on people's list of priorities.

With already so much work and activities to do, adding another thing to our plate could destroy our chances of finding something we love to do.

Also a lot of student are already doing a lot of community service.

People in SCHOOL_NAME a scholarship program at school have to do a certain number of community service hours.

And also tons of students that go to church have to.

Anyone in SCHOOL_NAME (which is most middle school students) have to fulfill a number of hours to reach a conformation.

It wouldn't be fair to add more to these kids and then others don't have to do as much.

Maybe a good idea, is to have the student council organize different ways of letting people know how important community service is.

Or even giving people that accomplish a certain number of community service hours rewards.

Doing this will make more kids that want to do community service come out and do it, instead of making people do it when they don't want to.

Students will have more fun if they have the time and want to.

It will have a much better outcome then forcing students.

"Driverless cars could be the next big thing. I think having driverless cars will be a sight to see. It doesn't seem like a bad idea to me. Of course they will need more work, but this could change the way people drive. Not only in U.S.A., but also the entire world.

For instance , Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. They aren't completely driverless, they send alerts to the driver to take over when things like a road block or an accident occurs. This just means the driver must remain alert at all times while in the vehicle. The driverless car is the same kind of function of an autopilot for a plane. While the driver is waiting for their turn to take over the wheel , it wont give them enough time to text, or use their phone. This can reduce the crash rate around the world.

Imagine how the future will be in 5 to 10 years. The driverless car could be one of the greatest things to happen in the century! All we have to do, is have a little hope. The Google cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. The Google car is still under maintenance. They are continuesly adding more details to it.

"Every student looks forward to the school year being over and going on sunny vacations for the summer. In some schools the learning standards require students to complete a summer project. The purpose of this is to help students retain previous learning from the school year. These projects should be teacher-designed because if students were to come up with the design for the project the concept may become unfair to other students and grading these projects would be harder for the teacher if he or she misunderstands the students point they were trying to explain.

Firstly, a student-designed project can put some kids at a disadvantage to resources. Some students may not have access to the internet or other devises to complete their project. If a project is assigned that require students to go out and complete an activity it could be expensive. Making the projects unfair for students who have low income families. The children in these families may be embarrassed about their money situation and not speak up for themselves and decide to figure out how they are going to complete the project later.

Secondly, a teacher-designed project would be easier for teachers to grade. They would have a better understanding of what to look for in a project and how to properly and fairly grade the students work. A student who has done a good project could get a poor grade if the teacher grading the project does not understand the concept the students was trying to convey. Also, a teacher-designed project would be easier for the students. They would have a crystal clear rubric and know exactly what their teacher was grading them on so that way the student is confident about their work.

Some people may say, a student-designed project would increase the likelihood of students completing the project over the summer if they came up with the idea behind the it. However, students should complete the project regardless of who designed it. The student should know and consider the importance of the project for their grade in the class. These projects are designed to help the students and to not hurt their grades.

In conclusion, a project designed by a teacher will organizes the learning criteria better than if a student had designed it. Making grading easier for teachers and constructing projects that are fair for the students.

"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis; drivers should be able to use cell phones in a restricted capacity while operating a vehicle. Using a mobile phone while driving can be distracting to most people, especially the younger generations. This makes is very dangerous and there have been horrible accidents and even deaths to happen while texting and driving in particular. While this may be a true fact, there are different ways you can control the use of cell phones while driving.

Some states have made it illegal to use a cell phone while driving and others passed laws that enable your use of cell phones restricted like Georgia and the hands free law. Some may argue that the hands free law is not safer than holding a phone while driving. I think that there are more things that can be put in place to assist with the use of cell phones and driving.

My argument is that I believe we should be able to use cell phones in a more restricted way which will eventually save lives. We currently live in a world where technology rules us as humans. I say why not allow it to rule us in a safe way. We have self-driving cars; hands free voice to type mechanisms on our devices and even most vehicles that are being made now can read your text for you as you drive. In my opinion, if we use more of these mechanisms properly it would save more lives. Self driving cars will allow us not to be worried about driving on the road; if you insist on texting and driving, why not use the voice to text feature on your phone and finally purchasing a vehicle that will read and type the text to you.

While my theories seem far fetched, I believe one day we will be able to live in a world where we will be able to operate cell phones and drive on a daily basis without getting hurt. Technology has brought us this far we should be able to go further if we invent ways to use it in a safe and responsible manner.      ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"I claim that it would be better if the Electoral college would stay the same .And the reason why it should stay the same its because the the way its been going but it has been also having some small problems but they are also reasons hwy it should stay the same.

The problem is that if you want to vote for president you can't because you are going to have to vote for aleast 34 Democratic and they elct the president,not you. And the electors are the onnes that are not holding public office. the other promble is that it also depends on the state you are living on because that is it dependson who picks the electors. The ones that mostly pick them are states conventions,party's central committee or even sometimes the presidential candidates themeselves.

I claim that it should stay the same because of these reason, Certainty of outcome , in 2000 it was possible that the dispute over the outcome if an Electoral College vote and around the 2012's the election , obama received a 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to oly 51.3 percent and that was alot. also the college had to restores some of the weight in the political blance that large states lose by  virtue of the mal apportionment, wich the senate decreed in the consitution. There wasa method that the Elecotral college use and that was that to select the president that will turn off the potential voters for a candidate,there are five reasons for retaining the electoral collega despite its lack of democratic pedigree.

In passage 3 it says that the Electoral College has consists 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president and  one for each member in the houseof respresentatives plus two for your senators and the presidential election mostly is held or four yeas on the tuesday after the first monday in november and i think that is doing a great job one elctions,electors, and on picking the president. also thats why i think its better if the electoral college stays the same.

"Have you ever wanted to know what a Seagoing Cowboy is? Well, today you a going to learn what a Seagoing Cowboy is. You should join the Seagoing Cowboy progam because its a progam that delivers Animals, Food Supply, and or car parts. The Seagoing cowboy program was started in World War 2 it offically launched bussiness with the UNRRA to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

In paragraph 1, it states that,"" Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his High School Graduation. He was working two part-time jobs when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a Cattle Boat."" Also in paragraph 2, ""It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many Countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. UNRRA hired ""Segoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

"As an 8th grader, I have to say that making decisions is a big part of our lives. We have to make decisions every day, from what to wear to what to eat for lunch. But sometimes, making decisions can be hard, especially when it comes to big things like what college to go to or what career to pursue. So, should we make decisions independently or seek guidance from experts and authorities?

Well, there are pros and cons to both. Making decisions independently means that we get to decide what we want and what is best for us. It also teaches us how to think critically and make decisions on our own. But, it can also lead to mistakes and bad decisions if we don't have all the information. On the other hand, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can give us the information and knowledge we need to make good decisions. It can also help us avoid mistakes and bad decisions. But, it can also limit our creativity and independence.

One real-life example of this is when I had to decide which sports to try out for in middle school. I could have just gone with what my friends were doing, but I decided to try out for soccer instead. It was a hard decision, but I'm glad I made it because I discovered that I really like soccer and I'm good at it too. But, if I had sought guidance from my parents or coaches, I might have ended up in a sport that I'm not as interested in.

However, if I continually rely on outside help for making decisions, I might not develop my own decision-making skills. It's important to strike a balance between making decisions independently and seeking guidance from experts and authorities. We need to learn how to make decisions on our own, but also know when to ask for help.

In conclusion, making decisions is a big part of life, and there are pros and cons to both making decisions independently and seeking guidance from experts and authorities. It's important to strike a balance and learn how to make decisions on our own, but also know when to ask for help. By doing this, we can develop our decision-making skills and make good decisions that will help us in the future.",1,llama2_chat,0

"Have you experience taking online classes from home?

students who plans to take online classes from home they would have to learn to be more responsible and dedicated. Could students benefit by taking online classes from home,

Yes I think it would be fantastic idea taking classes from home, it would be a great way to learn without having to leave your house or worrying you wont get to school on time. Home school can get you more prepare by learning and working on time managment,by woking on time managment prepares you for future jobs. For example I have friend that does home schooling she tried going to a regular school but didnt feel comfortable her parents decided to try home schooling, she ended up loving it,she had more time do other activities, its a great idea because you could prevent bullying from happening.

Imagen not having to leaving youre home, students would have more energy because they wouldn't be as exausted. Cerain students have walk miles not matter the bad weather. If students take online classes they could get more sleep and finish there work faster. students would be able to concentrate. In school you get distracted a lot because you have friends next to you trying to talk or make caos also interupting the class.

Not having energy for school is a big factor specially for student who work and walk to school in the mornings.

if student dont have the enery to go to school learn they would not be able to get good grades. a clear example is myself having to wake up every morning at seven am and walking thirty min to school and also working every day is exausting not matter the weather. Its really hard trying to stay awake in the mornings after walking a certain distance. Thats why i would prefer online studying as well it would change my life completely and i would feel more ready to do work.

in conclusion online classes is a great way to study if you dont feel comfortable going to school.

I would take online clases its less tiring its a great rest having the time to do my work from home and expirience a new way to study.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I am for the use of self driving cars, most accidents that happen on the road are due to humman error. self driving cars are one safer due to reduced human error, they are more cost efected due to the fact that once all cars are self driving they will no longer need road signs as cars can communicate with each other, and also due to that fact it is more time effective and in being time effective will be more cost effective as well.

Humans error accounts for 90% of all road way accidents the other precent is due to mechanical failure. As Google has shown with it having driven more than half a milion miles without a crash that cars are cappable of being safe, you can make the argument humans are in these cars but the car only alerts the human inside if it can not make it through the problem its self, which these problems such as accidents are caused by human error to begin with the car can not account for something that is not supposed to happen because it should not happen with all self driving cars. which leads me to my next point that it will be better for the goverment and tax dollars.

Self driving cars are computers they can communicate with each other, they are programmed to read the road and communicate where they are and how fast they are going to the cars around them so all the appropriate changes to speed can be made in a fashion that humans cant due because we can communicate to each other from 2 miles away, and since humans no longer need to communicate at all all road signs that are required not to ensure that traffic knows where its going will be a thing of the past. with this out of the way there is no more need for upkeep of these signs and communication devices they can be taken down and recycled for something of more use or recycled for money saving tax dollars while also making the envioment better by reducing all the cluter along the road ways. it will also shorten how much time is taken to reach a destination which might just extend out time on earth.

Time is the most limiting factor in someones day, you can do a lot of things but you cant just make time out of thin air. commutes in the city of Las Angeles can take hours just because of traffic. with cars that communicate these times would be reduced so signifigantly they would be minimal to none, therfore if this was to happen we would save so much on gas, emmisions on cars would be lower causeing less money to go to making the air cleaner, green house effect would go down due to emmisions being less. This by its self might make it so we can stay on the earth longer cars make up a lot of emmision that goes into polluting our air, so in turn you might just be saving yourself from getting cancer if you switch to a car that gives off little to no emmsions. You might even be able to save money by swtiching to a self driving car, the Goverment could give tax subsides to those who buy the car becuase it saves on accidents, emmisions, and taxes to keep the signs up. another point is insurance, you would no long need insurance beacuse accidnets would no longer be a problem saving you thousands of dollars over your lifetime.

self driving cars are the way to a better and more safe future, they dont have the human error that accounts for 90% of all wrecks that happen on the road today. they are more effect for taxes sake causing our taxes to go to something you might actually want funded like school, the possiblities are endless. lastly they are just going to save you money, tax subsides from the Goverment, insurance isnt required anymore, and it saves you time allowing you to do what you really want to do with our day. Just like the old saying ""time is money"" are these cars will save you a lot of both.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Adopting the approach of seeking advice from multiple people is a great way to gain a broad variety of perspectives. This can provide a comprehensive view of a situation and allow you to make a well-informed decision. Additionally, multiple perspectives may even challenge existing thoughts and ideas. A disadvantage, however, is that each opinion must be carefully weighed to determine the most suitable advice, which can take time and effort. Additionally, there is a potential risk of too many ideas becoming overwhelming and hard to synthesize. Ultimately, it is important to remember that seeking advice from multiple people comes with both advantages and disadvantages, so it’s important to figure out if it's the right option for you.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Based on the articles for "" Car-Free Cities"", not having or limiting car usage will not only change our lives, but it could also make our cities a better place to live. As Heidrum Walter says

""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way""

source 1. We could all agree that when we are driving we are mostly worried about if we could crash or no, if we might get a ticket, this causes us to be tense and might affect our health. So why not just leave the car for a minute and walk or use a bycicle?

limiting car usage will also improve the conditions of our environment, by not using cars as much as we do we can reduce greenhouse gases, which could help preserve the ozone layer. According to source 2 ''

After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of globla city''

. If in some days a big city could reduce the amount of air pullution by a partial driving ban, imagine what will happened if the amount of driving cars is reduce for years. Reducing car usage could also help our health, studies show that the people that are sitting most of the day are most likely to get cancer,  most of the people out there are driving all day and they dont do any type of exercise.

In conclusion, let me just emphesize that reducing car usage will bring positive changes not only to our lives but to our environment. As a business man from colombia name Carlos says'

'It's a good opportunity to take away streess an lower air pollution""

(source 3). All around the world people are leaving and selling their cars, according from the sources. In germany, paris,and colombia they all have  or had car-free cities for a day. As we can see all of those people  had positive changes in their lives the minute they left the car. Why dont we just try to be car-free for a day and see how better you will feel.  By going one day without cars we could also support president  Obama's amitious goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emmisions

(source 4) and we could also reduce  the amount of people getting sick.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"cars are everywhere these days, and they are commonplace among us. getting from point a to point b almost always involves using a car. but there is a different method of transportation emerging and that is public transportation. there are many benefits to public transportation including reducing emissions, having less cars on the road, and improving cities. this one far-fetched idea is now coming into the spotlight.

in cities like chicago and new york, the skies are dark and gloomy and pollution is in the air. the main contributing source come from emissions from cars. limiting the usage of cars would help to clear the skies and stop some pollution from filling the air. the quality of life would then be much better in these cities. ""after days of near record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" paris needed to ban cars because the smog and pollution in the city was getting out of hand. if there were fewer cars in the city, this type of problem would never be an issue here or around the world.

traffic is always a big issue on the roads around the united states and the world. limiting car usage would ease the traffic and make roads a lot safer. when the car ban was in place in paris ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five-days of intensifying smog."" when less cars were out on the road, accidents would be greatly reduced and city highways like the ones in chicago, illinois would be much more manageable. there would be more money to work on roads since the traffic is reduced and the roads would also stay in prestine condition for longer amounts of time. events like car-free day have already had big impacts in other parts of the world and the impact would be even greater in larger countries such as the united states. ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" having less cars on the road would benefit our society in more ways than one.

quite a few years ago, ideas such as public transportation becoming mainstream seemed pretty far-fetched. well today, those ideas can help buisnessses and whole towns limit car usage. when cars are used less frequently, the areas that have more frequent usage will be cared for even more. new sidewalks, restaurants, and shopping will emerge throughout cities and be a huge advantage. caring for roads have little benefit and putting money into public areas will help out cities tremendously. ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks. new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" using public transportation instaid of cars will greatly improve cities.

cars have been around for a long time and have served us for many years. now, reducing or getting rid of them seems like a viable option because emissions will be reduced, there will be less cars on the road, and cities would be improved. this task of getting rid of cars may seem hard to do but the infastructure for it is already in place. public transportation is already in larger cities such as new york and chicago and it can easily be installed in smaller towns and communities. the advantages such as less pollution and more greatly outweigh the minor inconvienences. smart planning is the best option to encompass all of these ideas. "" it seperates suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called smart planning."" smart planning is not only the wisest opportunities and advantages of limiting car usage for now, it is also meant to help future generations have a safer and cleaner world to live in.

"Dear Principal,

I ,as a SCHOOL_NAME Student, think that having community work should be required. Community work will help not just the community but will also help your self. Doing a little help for the community is not something that should just be thought of as not important. It should be something that people like to do, I mean its your community the place were you live, why wouldn't you want your city to look as great as any other place.

Being a student here makes me proud to be who I am. Helping the community out is nothing to pay for just being here at this school. Without a community this school would not be here, even if it was no one wants to go to some dirty and totally nasty school. Why would you want that, when if every one helps out for just a little while your community would look great and then every one would want to go to your school or your community to live in, meaning more jobs, more money, and more families.

Now I can see why someone would say, ""Help out the community, why would I do that. I have better things to do. That's why they have jobs to clean the city."" Well that is true, but I say that if no one was to help the community why would any one want to come to a place were every is to lazy to help out the community. Which in turn will have people, say like your neighbor, who will need your help with something like putting up Christmas lights up, and you might just say no and say to hire someone to do it for you. The community is a place of friends and families growing up together, not fighting each other.

This is why I, STUDENT_NAME, say that the principle should have community service required. This is something that keeps the community together, friends who work together for a very happy community!

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I honestly think Policy one is a good policy for the reason that we like to use our phones.

The reason i pick policy one is because if you have free time and there's nothing to do you can use your phone to hear music, use it for a calculator , and browse the internet. Also because you never know if there's an emergency going on with your family and what if they call you or text you to let you know what happened. I honestly think we should have policy one in our school's policy. However,

I agree phones should always be put away if the teacher doesn't let you use it.

It would be very cool and exciting if we get to use our phones during lunch time when we have free time. It would be really fun to have it out to hear music and do many things on our phone. I don't think using our phones when we have free time would be a bad idea. I would really like policy one to be one of our policy. I think if we have that policy students would be very happy, excited, and glad to use our phones. Policy one would be a good policy to our school. I myself would honestly like to have policy one i think all the other students would to!

"In school learning is declining more and more every year. With new technology more schools are adding programs where people can learn from home. I believe students would benefit from attending classes at home because students would be able to learn at there own pace, provide more rest, and give students more time to do another task.

Attending classes at home would let students learn at there own pace. Some students feel that the in school learning an be rushed or not fast enough. From experience, i would choose attending classes at home instead of in school. If someone is slower in certain subject, they can learn it at a pace that they would be able to retain and remember the information. While in school classes rush to get in two units in 3 weeks, attending classes at home would give students the liberty to take there time and not feel rushed to finish. Feeling rushed has been proven to produce worse work than when your not rushed.

Students are commonly tired when they first show up to school. They are woken up at the crack of dawn to leave when the sun is just coming up to go straight to learning. The brain can struggle to process and retain information when it is tired. Students would be bale to get more rest when they attend at home classes. They wouldnt have to wake up at 5 am just to go straight to working. They wouldnt have to stay up all night working on homework. The could get a good nights rest and wake up awake and not have to worry about go straight to doing school work.

Attending classes at home would give students more time to complete other important tasks that they couldnt complete when taking in school classes. Many students have jobs, out of school sports teams, and sometimes a kid. Taking at home classes would give students more time to make more money for weather it be college, car payments, and new technology. It would also give them a chance to still play on that sports team theyve always dreamed of or train to make a college team and still go to school.

In conclusion, attending at home classes are a good thing. They help many and give more benefits than in school learning. Many students believe this and so do some parents. Technology is the future and it is a global epidemic. More rest, learning at there own pace, and more time in there day are all benefits of at home classes and will be the reasons more students will try them.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Extracurricular activities after school could be really good for some people. It could teach kids to learn responsibly, help them be active, and it could really help them be more social and meet new people.

Students often lack responsibly. They often forget and misplace, not worried about homework or simply to lazy to do anything else. I think if students do extracurricular activities they would take more action and be more responsible. If a student is in the yearbook club he or she would have to be at school. This would stop skipping school and could possibly prevent bad grades. Responsibilty can also help student with there school work. They would care more about homework, study for test, and could help them be a honner roll student.

Students also need to start being active. Students need to be busy running,playing,jumping. I feel like if students be more active after school they would make exercising a habit and would not be over weight. Being active can also be help them relive stress from school. All that school work can put a lot of pressure on a kid and have them shut down mentally. Sometimes a kid needs to be a kid and just run around and play to relive stress.

Students need to start being more social. After school activities could help kids be more social and be more open. After school activates will help students raise there hand more and ask question in class because they aren't shy will feel more comfortable asking question and not worry about getting made fun of. After school activities could help students be less anti social and have more friends to talk to. Extracurricular activities can help a student by having them feel more open about talking to other adults about anything going on in or outside of school. These activities are important because kids can be very shy and not want to talk to people. This could help them talk more and be a better person emotionally.

Having Students do extracurricular activities isn't bad at all. It teaches kids how to have responsibly, keeps kids actives, and having them more involved and social. They also can learn life problems and how to solve them. They can't do that if they are anti social or lack responsibly, and not consistent or active with what they do.",0,persuade_corpus,1

On the other hand, those who do not find these classes to their liking may be missing out on classes that offer significant life skills, such as team work, communication, and analytical thinking.

"The author supports his arguement quite effectively, though not without any flaws. The author effectively lists off the benefits of exploring Venus, and proper proposals for doing so, however the complexity and unrealistic assumptions of the solutions as well as the negative descripton of Venus take away from its point rather than benefiting it.

The effective conveying of benefits helps to support its idea of risking danger for the reward of landing. The author describes how Venus is relatable with earth which creates a connection between the reader and Venus, as well as creating a mood of hospitality and familiarity. It also states that because Venus is the ""nearest option for a planetary visit"", it is a benefit to inhabit Venus first. This persuasion effectivly uses logos to show the audience logical reasoning for why the scientists should endevour to research Venus.

The author's proposals for ways to accomplish these tasks help to build ethos in the writing, as it shows that the author knows about the information that is displayed. The introduction of NASA also builds up this ethos, as to bring the audience to better trust in the author. The examples of proposals also provide evidence for how such ideas could be accomplished, such as the ideas of ""systems that use mechanical parts"" and therefore add to the logos of the paragraph, as the author logically explains why the proposals would be beneficial.

However in contrast with the effective support of the main idea, the author also convey's information and techniques that oppose his idea. Firstly, the author makes assumptions about how much technology would have advanced, and because his proposal for a ""blimp-like vehicle"" is so technologically advanced and seems outlansish, the mood created for the audience is incredulous and skeptical. This does not benefit the writer's ideas because of the audiences mood, and therefore the author loses the audiences trust in proper solutions.

Also negatively impacting the main idea are his descriptions of Venus. This is because the author uses a lot of evidence to support how dangerous Venus is, in direct contrast to what he should be supporting. Because of the logos used to show how dangerous Venus is, like how it has ""temperatures average over 800 degrees"" the audience is put into a mood of impossibility and doubt. Because of the mood of the audience, the audience is also less likely to understand why Venus could be beneficial if the landscape is so terribly trecherous.

In conclusion, the writer does a fairly effective job at expressing is ideas, in his building of ethos and pathos that help to support why Venus is so amazing, and how to explore it, however fails by accidently creating a mood of unbelievablity, and therefore losing the audience to the uncertain nature of the situation. If the author had attempted to create a mood that was more beneficial to persuading the audience, the passage would have been extremely effective in persuading the audience of his thesis.

"The youth are the leaders of tomorrow. This is often said by older individuals regarding the upcoming generation. As a leader, one often has to make many decisions and develop designs for numerous events and plans. In order to prepare the youth for this role, they should be given assignments that allow them to design and solve situations. School is one of the various places where the youth can practice this skill. Summer projects assigned to student should be student-designed because project would be of high quality, students will better retain the information that they learn and the students are motivated to complete the project.

The first reason why summer projects should be student-designed is due to the fact that the completed projects would be of high quality. Students will invest copious amounts of time and effort in order to complete the project that they have designed. This was seen with chemistry students, at Generic_School, who designed their own lab involving a unit taught in class. Those students spent an extended amount of time investing and researching information that they needed to conduct the lab that they designed. The students also spent hours in lab, running through numerous trials and collecting data. The dedication that theses students posses displays the lengths the students may go to, so they can complete their self designed project. The large amount of effort and time that students put into their project results in high quality work because students have a deep understanding of the topic and strong application which is illustrated in their project. Schools should assign student-designed summer projects as the completed project would be of high quality.

The second reason that schools should allow summer projects to be student-designed is because students will better retain the information that they learn. When students are given the power to design their own project, they are more attentive to the information that they are gathering. This was seen with history students, at Generic_School, who conducted research and wrote a paper on a social group during World War II. When going through sources and evaluating them, students paid close attention to the dates and origin of the sources. This was helpful for students as it prevented them from wasting time on sources that were not beneficial for their paper. Students were also able to have deep conversations with each other about the various socials groups using the information that they had learned online. Assigning student-designed projects for the summer should be done because students will better retain the information that they learn.

The final reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students would be more motivated to complete the project. When giving students the freedom to design a project that they will be working on for almost three months, empowerment is often felt by students as they believe that they are respected and trusted enough to develop a project based off of their own design. This empowerment causes students to have more desire to complete the project, and the projects will be completed to high level of satisfaction. This can also be seen when a parent tells their child to make a meal for dinner. The child feels empowered since they have the freedom to create whatever dish they like; the empowerment that the child feels motivates the child to complete the task to a high satisfaction level. Student-designed the summer projects would also result in eagerness from the students. Since students have the ability to design their project, they would be more inclined to create a design that is interesting to them. This interest would make students eager as they will want to see the results of their plans.

Student-designed summer projects should be assigned by schools because students' motivation to complete the project would increase.

Teacher-designed summer projects would be less time consuming for students;however, teacher-designed projects would not prepare students for the upcoming school. During the school year, students are often required to create their own essay, lab design and presentation by teachers for a grade. Students completing a design that they have created will allow them to practice skills that teachers will require during the school year.

Overall, summer projects assigned by schools should be student-designed because the completed projects would be of high quality, students will better retain the information that they learn and students would be more motivated to complete the project. These reasons should encourage schools that assign summer project to allow the projects to be student-designed.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"What if you were being made to participate in an extracurricular activity. I agree with principals making students at their schools participate in extracurricular activities . First, students participating in sports will be getting the 60 minutes or more of physical activity that they need to stay fit and healthy. secondly, kids that help with the yearbook get to show the school their creative side. lastly, participating in extra curricular activities allows them to show their talent to everybody. in the end, principals should make their students participate in extracurricular activities.

First, students participating in sports will be getting the 60 minutes or more of physical activity that they need to stay fit and healthy. Some kids enjoy a sport and don't always get to play that sport in P.E class or while they are at home. kids now days are becoming more attached to electronics; making them participate in a sport allows them to stay active. Some sports teams are like second families so kids like practicing. In total, making kids participate in sport will give them the opportunity to do what the love and to stay active.

secondly, kids that help with the yearbook get to show the school their creative side. Some artistic kids like to show their art skills without putting their name on it and people knowing it's them. kids like to make things and allow the whole school to see their creation. Shy and outgoing kids like to be creative so making them choose an extracurricular activity can let them be themselves. All in all, kids that help with the yearbook can show their creative side.

lastly, participating in extracurricular activities allows students to show their talent to everybody. Some kids have talents but don't always have activities to get to show everybody that talent. Every student is different and might like different things; making them participate in extracurricular activities will allow them to find what they're are good at and what the love. Making students find what they're good at and love. After all, making kids participate in extra curricular activities will allow them to find what they enjoy doing.

What if you were being made to participate in an extracurricular activity. I agree with principals making students at their schools participate in extracurricular activities . First, students participating in sports will be getting the 60 minutes or more of physical activity that they need to stay fit and healthy. secondly, kids that help with the yearbook get to show the school their creative side. lastly, participating in extra curricular activities allows them to show their talent to everybody.

In conclusion, making students participate in extracurricular activities will benefit them in many ways.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Making Better Choices

Do you have trouble making choices by yourself? Sometimes people aren't sure what to do in certain situations so they ask for advice. I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because other people may have more experience with the topic, you can learn a lot from others, and getting multiple opinions can help you feel more confident in what you are choosing. Advice can be very helpful.

First, other people may have more experience on the topic than you. If you haven't dealt with something much then it will be very useful to get advice and opinions from multiple people who have dealt with your problem before. You should ask numerous people about their past experiences to find out what worked best for them. All of that will help you come to a decision that will hopefully work out. Humans who have more knowledge on your subject will be wiser and can give you a lot of important input to think about when it comes to making a choice. I personally like to talk to my parents about issues because they know much more than I do and usually make the right choices.

Next, you can learn more about your problem from others. When talking to multiple people they may point out some things you never noticed or thought about, they can also look at your situation from another point of view. This is good because you may be focused on one thing but there could be many other important details that you overlooked. You should always ask more than one person about your problem so that you get a range of opinions and not just one that could be biased. Others may also have more information that you were not aware of.

Finally, if you talk to lots of people and receive their opinions, it will help you feel more confident about the decision you choose. If you are making a hard choice, it is important to feel good about what you decide. Knowing that other people agree with you and having a lot of feedback will make you more comfortable with your choice. It can also be less stressful if you know that others believe you are doing the right thing. Many people greatly care about what others think so it can be a relief if they are helped and supported in making a good choice.

In conclusion, listening to others advice can be very beneficial. You should always talk to numerous people about important decisions. I think that getting multiple opinions will help people make the best choice because they will gain more information on their problem, they will be more comfortable with their choice, and others might have dealt with similar problems before so they have more knowledge on the issue. No one has to try to find a solution on their own.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The Challenge of Exploring Venus

In this story the author is talking about Venus. Alot of people could care less about the planets but its a big part of the world today. In this story its talking about Venus and everything people need too know about it. I think the author in this passage described Venus well. He/she explained everything about Venus, The size, were its located, how hot it is etc. I think this cause in passage 1,2,3 it gives alot of information on Venus. And the author organized the facts really well by putting alot of facts in each paragraph and focusing on that and giving alot of information on that subject. In paragraph 4 it talks about how Venus is almost like the earth and how maybe one day they would like too visit. This is a huge thing cause if so we could have another planet of life. So in conclusion i think this article was very well planned and had just the right amount of infomation for a average person too learn and know about.  ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"How can seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice? It can help the person make a better choice because the more advice or opinions you give to that person the harder they think about what choice their gonna take. But not in all cases it's the same because everyone is different and every person has a different mindset,It can help people in a good way and in a bad way.

For example if a person who was seeking opinions or advice about what car to buy, they would ask for opinions from their family or friends about whats a great deal or price on a car?,Is it in good condition?,Does it have good mileage? Because that person doesnt want to buy a car thats not gonna be worth buying and, Their can be so many opinions and that would make the person think really hard about what decision he's gonna take because not everyone is gonna have the same opinion about the same car.

Many people can make bad choices too,like for example if teenager was to dropout of high school and didn't ask for opinions and advice about the situation he would most likely pick the bad choice and regret It after. If he wouldve gotten multiple opinions from people,they would tell him not dropout of school and they would explain their reasons why he shouldnt pick that route or choice and that person would really think about it and would think about the consequences.

Another example can be about having a baby a lot of people would have very different reasons if you should have a baby or not and depending on your age. If the person is around the age 21 they should ask a lot of their family members of what they think about having a baby,and if your asking yourself this, why should we ask for multiple opinions from our family members or parents? Because there those kinds of people who probably have already gone through that situation. And its best to ask people who have gone through a lot stuff because they might ve gone through really bad stuff or made really bad choices in there past and they would probably would be glad to help you out to make the better choice then they did.

Overall I think seeking multiple opinions and talking to more than one person can really help you out in a lot different ways and dont get me wrong their are cons too but I wouldnt say there are more pros because everyone has different opinions and advice. It can make a lot of people successful in life and in many other things too just because they took peoples advice and listened to their opinions. It can make other people make bad choices too probably because they took the wrong advice from the wrong person or didnt even ask for opinions or advice.           ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"People sometimes ask more than one person for advice on hard decisions. How can asking multiple people for advice help someone make the right choice? I think getting advice from more than one person is helpful because they'll have different peoples opinions.

Receiving more advice is very useful, because one person could of been in the same situation your in and the other person could just know the right thing to do. The person that has been in the situation before could have did the wrong, and messed up something then you seek ideas that they give you to do the right. On the other hand the person such as your parent gives you advice knows more than the person you asked before because they been on the earth longer and seen bad things happen. Advice from multiple people is useful to put all their ideas, and or opinions together to make your own good decision.

Seeking advice from all different basketball coaches, and trainers is very good because they'll have lots of their own opinions. Generic_Name from Generic_School could tell you, ""Need to work on moving without the ball"", but your high school coach tells you that ""You need to work on, on the ball defense"". One trainer could say ""You got to work on your jump shot off the dribble a little more, but another trainer says ""Your jump shot is fine, but you have to improve your handles."" Trainers can give you ideas on what college you choose to go to when the decision comes down to that.

People ask for more than one person for advice why do people do that? I think that's a good idea to do because you learn from people. Won't make the same mistakes that they have did. People can tell different stuff you need to work on if it's sports, school, or being yourself. All advice is good.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Although a motorized vehicle provides the opportunity to transport citizens from place to place, limiting the usage of a car may be considered more beneficial. Car usage limitations allow the citizens to feel less stressed, show a decrease in air pollution and a promotion towards alternative transportation, and a decrease in habit.

The article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" (Source One), suburban pioneers have decided to permently give up cars. Although the usage of cars are generally forbidden in Vauban, its fellow citizens express that they were ""always tense... [are] much happier this way"" without the use of a car in their lives. When individuals are stressed, they're constantly worrying and not fully paying attention to surroundings; therefore, stress is considered one of the causes of vehicle crashes. Also, the congestion of traffic (if not awful enough already) will become worse with the crash which causes more individuals to become stressedl. Without the use of cars, citizens are less stressed and can go about their daily lives. Vauban is considered to be ""the most advanced experiment in low-car suburband life"" because of the attempt to make the city denser and a better place for walking has succeed.

""Paris bans driving due to smog"" (Source Two), mainly focuses on the environmental issues that car usage has been causing throughout the city. After a near-record, pollution, Paris strictly enforced a driving ban to ""clear the air of the global city"". The smog from the motorized vehicles is hazardous to our environment which therefore can be damaging to us and our bodies if we only inhale smog. Therefore, health problems are presented among the population and causes an endless loop of health concerns to be dealt with. These can be considered ""solved"" if the environmental issues are presented and dealt with immediately and effectively. Luckily, with Paris going in the right direction with the ban, health concerns will decrease as well as the smog in the air. Because of the ban that Paris has plaaced, congestion was ""down 60 percent in the capital of France"". Presented later, the smog in the city has began to clear enough. Two beneficial causes have been brought forth all because of limitations on the usage of cars.

""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" (Source Three),  explains how Bogota has a dedication day to the use without cars. According to a business man, Carlos Arturo, he explains how the day of dedication relieves stress and lowers the pollution. In order to transport oneself from place to place, citizens can walk or ride bicycles. Because of the large impact that Bogota has made, ""municipal authorites from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic"". In summary, this city has made quite an influencial mark on others. With prediction, this event could end up carrying throughout the world because of the incredible benefit that it has on our planet: the decrease of air pollution. It not only helps us, but it provides help to the world. Another article, ""The End of Car Culture"" (Source 4), explains that a study has been made on the American drivers: ""... are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". If this pattern continues, it'll provide implications for carbon emissions and the environment, seeing as ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"". If we could reduce this, our lives and breathing conditions can be improved dramatically. The quote, ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit"", means that if we can break the habit of buying cars, there will be no more habit to continue with.

In conclusion, the reduction and limitations of car usage will not only be beneficial to us, but it'll become greatly beneficial to our environment; which becomes an endless loop of helping one another out.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Driverless cars would'nt be substaintial to todays society. There's people that drive that are irresponsable with cars that needs a driver, So what would happen if there are driverless car?

Then you have the drunk drivers who may think that it's okay to drive home drunk since they techniacally wont be the ones driving. Overall driverles cars would just be unsafe

People today are already irresponsible with driving, especially teens. There are the car races or teens that thinks its okay to just drive at any mile they want, run stop lights and etc. People may thionk that since driverless cars are computer based there would be less accidents or people who just have road rage, but technology isnt always reliable. there can be malfucntions. What if a driver is in the middle of traffic and the car is having technical difficultkies so the car just spins out of cointrol and cant be handled.

Thats also affecting the drivers around them.

If the car still needs a driver then it should'nt be called a driverless car.

"NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circiling Mars and snapping photos of possible laninding sites. It spotted what looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. There are many conspiracy theorists that think this is proof of life on Mars. I disagree. The article states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" The face like shadows that were captured on Mars can be compared to landforms on Earth. I think that what is thought to be a face, is just a hill-type mass with shadows that look like a face at certian angles. The article also says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeares on JLP web site, revealing . . . a nautural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" So what this means is that the landform has nothing to with life on Mars, just the planet itself. When NASA released the picture, they captioned it, ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" I personally think that what they had captioned the photo is all you need to know about what it is, a huge rock foundation. If what NASA captured was an actual aliens face, they claim they would release that information because it would do so much good for them. With scientists who studied the pictures, the declaired it was only a landmass. So without the evidence of other life on Mars, that's all anyone can call it for now.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Self-reliance is an important attribute to possess in order to be successful and lead a happy, fulfilling life. It involves having the common sense to solve a problem without expecting someone else to take the lead and responsibility. Experience matters as well, since having prior knowledge and learning from mistakes helps one make sound judgements and take meaningful actions. Independence also plays a role in becoming self-reliant. It is important to be able to make decisions for yourself and not always have to rely on somebody else’s opinion. 

However, there is an argument against relying too much on oneself. For instances, it can lead to a lack of collaboration in which people become too isolated and don't learn from the ideas of others. Taking advice from someone who is more experienced in a field and learning from them can be beneficial and even highlight areas where one was ignorant. 

In conclusion, self-reliance is a necessary trait for leading a productive life but it should be balanced with taking constructive advice from others. Therefore, it is important to assess each situation and use wisdom in order to find the right amount of self-reliance to suit one’s needs.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"For years cars have been one of the most useful means of transportation. According to the article Sergey Brin the google cofounder ""He envisions a future with a public-transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system."" The article also points out the issues with the driverless cars such as that in all states except four, it is illegal to test computer driven cars. The safety of the passenger could be at risk if there is ever a glitch in the system and the harmful effects to our environment.

Most states have made it illegal to test computer driven cars because of their traffic laws. ""Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe care has a human driver in control at all times."" That is clealy stated in the article. The dangers behind driverless cars are way more important than their actually purpose. No where in the article do they address the causes to the environment that the driverless will make. Will they be electric or powered by gasoline. More research needs to be concluded before Google and other companies decide to open these to the public.

When a computer glitches the screen is frozen and there is no access to applications. What will happen when the computer operating a driverless car gives out. Brakes and everything could stop. This could cause car accidents which sometimes are harmless but other times can leave someone living there life paralyzed. The system will never be one hundred percent safe even if its 90 percent safe there is stil ten percent of people who could be left with injury or possibly death.

The money lost would not benefit our nation and the economy. The materials used to build driverless cars could be bad for our ecosystem. Global warming has increased over the years do to natural resources such as coal and oil. With more oil to be produced this would hurt and not help our nation.

Driverless cars should not be developed because of safety and the environment. This will not nor ever be a tool that will help America prosper. It will only do more harm than it will help. If they ever are completely built more research should be done, so that everyone on the rode is as safe as possible.             ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Distance learning is a program that allows students to take classes at home rather than school. I believe that this is a very beneficial resource to the average student. Distance learning is beneficial to absents students, students struggling with mental health, and students struggling with specific classes.

Distance learning would help students that have to absent due to family issues, a doctor's appointment, etc. If they had the ability to take the class online, then they would not be behind other students in the class. It would also maintain the speed of the class rather than having to slow down at certain points to explain concepts that the absent student had missed. For example, I was absent from a math class on Thursday, so I used an online tool that the teacher provided to take notes and learn what was taught in class that day. This benefited me so I could continue taking notes from where the entire class left off. However, when I missed a day in my history class, I was not able to get the notes and I did not know what was going on.

This form of learning would also be beneficial to students struggling with mental health issues. If they had the opportunity to finish their work online, then they could avoid some triggers at school as well as bullies. Sometimes students may avoid going to school because of their current mental state. For instance, my friend, PROPER_NAME, struggled with depression and anxiety, so she ended up missing a lot of school. This caused her to fail most of her classes. She was bullied a lot and online classes would've helped her avoid those people.

Another benefit to the availability of online classes is extra help for students that struggle with a particular area of school. For example, If I was failing Calculus, then I could just watch the lectures from the online classes and complete some of the practices to help me learn the concepts. It would prepare me for classwork, quizzes, and tests that I would have flunked otherwise. Also, it doesn't require staying after school, so students wouldn't have to find a ride or worry about when the teacher is available.

Absent students would be able to stay on top of their work with distance learning. Students struggling with mental health could also work and avoid mean people. Also, students struggling in a class could receive more help with areas they are not doing well on. Distance based learning would be very beneficial and I support it.",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Many of us have probably found our selves stuck in a situation when you cant decide on something. That can have us reaching out for advice from someone like a family member, friend, or even a stranger. But the person that you ask for help could have a different view point or idea than what had originally thought, wither good or bad. Getting advice from more than one person can prove to be a good thing to help you out when your having trouble seeing form diffrent angles form a decision making stand, asking for advice from multiple is good and can help you in decision making.

When asking more than one person for advice and hearing the different view points from them can prove very beneficial in your choice making.

Because listening to other peoples thoughts on things can help affect and mold your own ideas or choices. It can also help you to become more open minded about a new situation can be good for the mind because being able to see other positive outcomes of a different choice that you can make really helps you out in the long run and in a good way can help you choose a better choice.

When asking others for advice about making a choice, asking multiple people can help you make a better judgment and understand it more. When trying to decide on something we might not really understand what something means or have only seen a small fragment of its potential. By asking others and listening to what they think or know about it can therefore help you to understand more in depth and look at the bigger picture differently because of it.

I can agree that getting advice from more than one person can affect you in a positive way and can help you make better choices Because whenever I need advice trying to decide something like what food to order or what outfit looks better, I always ask my friends for help because I like to hear other peoples thoughts or opinions on something to help make a better decision then I could make on my own. When I was twelve years old my mom had signed me up for a summer camp that I didnt want to attend but talking to other people who had gone before made me change my mind, I was glad I was able to talk to them and changed my mind about it.

Asking for advice from multiple people is good for decision making, for example your family members, friends, or even strangers can help mold your choices or thoughts which can lead you to a making a better choice. They can better improve your knowledge or understanding of something that you didnt before, asking and talking about the different outcomes and other ideas with different people can help open more thoughts and opinions for you, and listening to others view points or beliefs can help you with your final choice.",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Dear Mrs. Principal,

I am writing you concerning our possible change in policy. I both agree and disagree with your idea on change the grade level average.

I disagree with you on this term: most of the students who participate in the sport activities have a grade level lower than your expectations. By changing this policy, you are eliminating most of the players who are committed to the sport activities. The majority of the students who also play sports try to keep their grades up, but have a hard time doing so because of the sports, yes. But this does not mean that the students don't care enough to learn. It might be that they do not understand what they are being taught, but they just don't want to voice that they don't understand. The change in policy will only make them feel panicked and their grades will drop even furthe. If they are given the chance to fully understand the lessons, like a private tutor, they will be able to get their grades up and keep them that way, hopefully getting rid of the shyness to voice their misunderstandings. Their performance in school and in the sport they play will be better if the policy is not changed.

I agree with you on this point, however: some students just don't care enough to learn. They would rather be out on the field or shooting some hoops. By changing the policy, you give them a reason to learn what they are being taught. If you eliminate the ability to participate in said sport, it will give them more time to focus on the schoolwork they need to get done. Once they do spend more time on their homework, they will be able to get their grade up to expectations, and hopefully keep it there once they rejoin the team. By having the policy changed their drive to learn will be increased, even if they dislike the idea, and it will help them later on in life.

Sincerely Yours,

"Dear principal

Have you ever had a goal that was bigger than life well me and my friends have some to we want to play sports but these demands on B or better in all subjects is making that hard .we think that you shouldn't change the policy on B or better to B ,that would really make the players work over time and most would not have the time to play and to turn in B plus work.

by doing so the players would have a bad time and they wouldn't have the fun that these sports bring them.

With this new policy comes a lot of problems like some of the star players are C students and i don't think that they could Get a B in every class. most of the students not playing sports are below the C average and they have extra time to do it in twenty thirty maybe even hours more than most sports players in the school .Also the people who do have all B' s aren't playing sports because to caught up in work to get those b' s.

Most students will have to leave sports all together because they cant make the grades ,Maybe making the teams lose the best players in the school. Most of these kids are natural players taking this away will make them turn to other alternatives such as playin",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

I think you should allow students to have cell phones in school. I think that as long as they aren't using them in class it should be alright to have it with them. The only time students should be allowed to use them are during lunch periods, free times they have in school, in class if the teacher approves, but not in quiet places like the library. Students should be allowed to have them because in many schools teachers don't let the students use their phones because of either previous things that have happened or because they don't trust the students. Another reason they might not let students use their phone is because they just don't think they should. Students not being able to have phones in school can be a bad thing. For an example, if there is a fire or something bad has happened the teachers won't let the students call home or tell their parents they are alright. That would be bad for the students and the school because if the students don't call their parents they would be highly upset and it would be bad for the teachers and schools because many parents would be calling up to the school to make sure everything is okay. Another reason I think you should let students bring their phones to school is because if a student is in trouble or someone is trying to fight them they can call their parents and get picked up. This would help the students and principals/staff in the school because they won't have to deal with the drama. Another reason is because many students need their phones for numbers or directions to places they need to be after school or if they are leaving during school. My last reason is that if a close family member in a students family has died the parents can call their child to tell them. Cell phones are very important in students and parents lives. Now, if you have a child and something important happened or something happened that you needed to know about and the teacher wouldn't let your child call you wouldn't you be upset or worried? That's how many parents feel when they can't reach their child. Please consider this letter and think about how important it is for a child to bring their cell phone to school. Thank you for your time in reading my letter.

"Cell phones have become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, and many argue that the technology should be allowed in the classroom. After all, cell phones are a powerful tool that can be used to enhance learning, facilitate collaboration between students, and with other technology. With the proper supervision and usage restrictions, cell phones can be used to supplement lessons and engage students in ways that simply weren't possible before. 

On the other hand, many people argue that cell phones are disruptive in the classroom, and have even been shown to decrease overall grades. Allowing phones can draw students' attention away from lessons, and give them an avenue to access distractions like social media and gaming apps during class. Furthermore, concerns over cheating become more real when smartphones are allowed in school, and can lead to unfair academic assessments. 

Ultimately, it is up to schools to decide if and how to allow cell phones to be used in the classroom. Both sides have valid arguments, and teacher should consider the needs of their particular classroom before implementing a policy.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"The author gives good reasons on why we should explore Venus. He/she describes the environmental hazards of the planet in order to explain to us on how NASA can explore and research it more. The author gives reasons on why we should take the risk to explore Venus such as it being closest to Earth, has potential for an earth-like atmoshphere, and can be a good use of planetary visit in the future.

According to the article, Venus is the the closest planet to earth after Mars; but that is depending on where we are when orbiting around the solar system. ""Often referred to as Earths twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too""(Venus 2). This part of the article is what describes the fact that it is similar to Earth. The planet is our neighbor, which makes it easier so that we wouldn't have to use tons of time, energy, and money on something that is too many light years away.

The author gives info on how Venus may have some Earth-like features which would be good so that we can use it as a secondary planet if something goes horribly wrong with Earth somehow. Venus has been reported to have similar structures such as valleys, mountains, craters, and even potential ocean life. The planet even has weather and similar natural disasters like Earth such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and even lightning stikes. ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface""(Venus 3). These are just some of the reasons the author gives on what potential Venus could have.

Finally, the author thinks that Venus would be a good backup planet to Earth, but it would be difficult to claim the land as ours and so that we could live there without any type of circumstances. The author also gives reasons on why it would be difficult to explore and find a way to live on this planet. But, it would give NASA a challenge on figuring out on what type of innovations they can make up. The author says on paragraph 5,""NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way""(Venus 5). These reasons alone can convince the reader that exploring and studying this planet would be worth the hard work and effort put into the inventions. The author could have given some reasons on why another planet to live would be worth THAT much work, but they did a good job otherwise.

The author has given good reasons and claims that made his or her's article convcing for the most part. They had evidence that can convince us and give us high hopes on what NASA could benifit from. The author wants us to explore Venus because it is closest to Earth, has potential for an earth-like atmoshphere, and can be a good use of planetary visit in the future. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Why should you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program? This program sent people across the sea with animals, food, and other resources that other countries needed after World War Two. I have personally participated in this program. After crossing the Pacific Ocean multiple times and the Atlantic Ocean more than 15 times, I would say this experience changed my life completely for the better. Others should join this charity type program, it will improve you and your life.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a great experience to have participated in. You get to see many natural and man-made landmarks you otherwise would not see. You get to visit many other cities and countries you would never be able to go to if you weren't hired as a ""cowboy on a boat"". Luckily, you can easily become a seagoing cowboy to make your life so much more exciting. Also, since you've always wanted to sail the seas, this would be a great opportunity. You'll always be excited as you float upon an uknown section of the earth. It almost sounds like a fairy-tale, but you can fortunatley actually live it. During what will be the greatest time of your life, you won't be lonely either.

As a Seagoing Cowboy, it's a chance to be social and put yourself in a friendly environment. You can play games and sports with the other participants. Find someone with the same hobby and have a conversation with them, so you will have a pal to do your favorite hobby with. Just have a talk about the things you saw, what you did, what you were thinking before you decided that it was obviously a good idea to become a Seagoing Cowboy for the UNRRA. Play table-tennis with them, maybe baseball, or volleyball. Do some reading by yourself or wih your pal to keep your brain just as good as it's always been. Maybe you want to box someone, or help someone out.

As a Seagoing Cowboy, you would be helping a lot of people and even countries get back on track after the devestating World War, which is unfortunatley the second world war. It could be a way to contribute to a charity. By directly delivering food, animals, and help to those who are helpless. Now, when you think about how that's what you're doing by going out to the sea, it makes you feel good, doesn't it? Not only does it make you feel great about your own life, but it actually makes another countries inhabitants feel good about their life, that they have their life despite the ruins of their country and their world after the war. So, it's obviously better for everyone when you become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Since you'll be helping other countries, having fun with friends, and experiencing a lot soon, you may be second-guessing yourself and thinking, ""What if I don't want to go to water, and I don't want to sail the seas?"" Well, assuming you don't like the water, you don't go on a boat often. Since one main thing of being a Seagoing cowboy is the experince, you'll be trying something you haven't done or don't usually do. You may still not like the fact you are on a boat in the sea, but after that, there are more benefits than there are things you don't like, which would be only one con. So you should join and participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program, make your life better, and others too.",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Here is my three reason why student should not go online do the classes work at home.

My first reasons:student should not do there classes from home.

Because it can be hard doing you work at home it batter do the work at work because you can get help by the teacher at home no one can help you. It can be hard to do the work from online because you don't know what the teacher can gave to you i will rather do it at school because it will be easy to do the teacher can help you with it will be hard try to do you classes work online at home.

My seconds reasons:student who are smart should do there classes online at home.

Student who pass the SOL and the class they should get out early from school because people who have a job they should get out early from school. Student should have a high GPA so they can find a collage they want to be they have to think what they want to be when they finish high and collage so they can have there own business person and make money. People who is smart should not go to school because they already pass every they did.

my third reasons:They should make classes work online only for the kids.

Because it will be easy for them to do they classes work online. They should make classes online only for kid it will easy fro them do it it at home batter then school but some parents they want there kid to go to school and do the work at school. If they school do classes online for kid it will be easy for teacher and for the kid.

My finial reason:For school offer classes online at home.

I think all high school student should have classes online at home because it will be easy for student and for the teacher. If student have classes work online at home they can copy from his friends that why is not good to have classes online. Middle school should have a classes work online at home.

"Title: The Power of Imagination and Knowledge in Achieving Success

Introduction:
Hey there! As an 8th grader, I've learned that having a good imagination and knowledge are super important in achieving our goals. Without them, we might miss out on some amazing opportunities. In this essay, I'll explain why imagination and knowledge are crucial, and how they can help us reach our dreams.

Imagination is like a magic wand that lets us dream big. It allows us to visualize things that don't exist yet, and come up with new ideas that can change the world. Without imagination, we wouldn't have things like technology, art, or even science. It's the spark that ignites creativity and innovation. But, it's not just about dreaming big, it's also about problem-solving. Imagination helps us think outside the box and come up with solutions to complex problems.

Knowledge, on the other hand, is like a map that guides us towards our goals. It's the foundation upon which our dreams are built. Without knowledge, we wouldn't know how to turn our ideas into reality. It's the key to unlocking our potential and achieving success. Knowledge helps us understand the world around us, and how to navigate it. It's what sets us apart from others and makes us stand out.

But, achieving our goals requires more than just imagination and knowledge. It takes effort! Effort is like the gas that powers our imagination and knowledge. Without it, we wouldn't be able to turn our ideas into reality. It's the fuel that keeps us going, even when things get tough. Effort is what separates the dreamers from the doers.

Now, let me give you an example of how imagination and knowledge can come together to help us achieve our goals. Let's say you want to apply for your dream job. You've always been fascinated by space exploration, and you want to work for NASA. You use your imagination to visualize yourself working on a space mission, and you spend countless hours researching and learning everything you can about space travel. You imagine yourself solving complex problems and overcoming obstacles, and you use your knowledge to come up",1,llama2_chat,1

"I'm fore the value of using this technology to read students emotional experssions why, because it would be neat that a scientists can scan on a computer to read students or anyone's emotions to see how they feel. In paragraph 3 it says that Dr. Paul Eckman had classifed 6 emotions which were happy, sad. surprise, anger, fear, and disgust on a painting so by weighting the different units of the software which can even identify mixed emotions. Dr. Hang predicts that it could modify a lesson which can be like an effective human instructor the techonogy can make computer animated faces more expressive, such as video games or video surgery.

Paragraph 7 it shows you a list of what you can do that list will show you how you can see the expression, In fact those instructions for a face that makes you look happy it is all about those muscular action units which they can indictate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. So in a real smile which it says in paragrpah 7 "" zygomatic major "" which means that the muscles that begin at your cheek bones which will lift the corners of your mouth.

According to the Facial feed back theory of emotion which is moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotion they may also even help produce them Constanin had his actors carfully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.

"Dear Principal,

I believe students should be required to do community service for several reasons. I believe it helps support kids to do nice things for others without being told and makes things a lot easier for the people they are helping.

I believe it helps kids do nice things for others without being told to do so because kids should know right from wrong. They should know when they are doing something right for others, and when they know they are, they feel better about themselves and people see them differently and with more respect. For example, if more kids did things for others they would be a lot nicer and more helpful with others, and would do more for the community.

I also believe kids should do community service because it makes things a lot easier for other people. For example, if more kids helped out teachers by tutoring their students the teachers would have high grades in their classes. Also if more kids help out teachers by keeping their students busy, the teacher would have more time to grade. And with the short time she spent grading, there would be more time for fun activities for the students to enjoy. Another example would be if more kids would pick up trash on the floor or throw their trash away, or maybe even recycle, the community would have a good reputation for being clean.

Over all, if the community saw that more kids are doing work for everyone, then other people would do the same and help out. Community service is good for everyone in the community, that's why I believe kids should be required to help out and do community service and make things in the world, or the city, a lot easier.

"Ugh, I can't believe I have to write another essay. But here it goes.

So, I think that music, drama, and art classes should be electives and not required. I know some people might say that these classes are important for kids to develop their creativity and stuff, but I don't think so.

First of all, music classes are just a waste of time. I mean, who's gonna listen to our terrible singing and playing? It's not like we're gonna be rockstars or anything. And don't even get me started on drama. I mean, who wants to act like a bunch of weirdos on stage? It's just not my thing. And art? Forget about it. I can't even draw a straight line. It's just not worth it.

And it's not fair to everyone. Some kids might actually be good at these things and enjoy them, but most of us aren't. So why force us to take these classes and pretend to be something we're not? It's just not fair to the kids who are actually talented and could be doing something they love, but instead they're stuck in a class with a bunch of people who can't even carry a tune.

And it's not important either. I mean, how many times are we gonna be graded on our ability to play the recorder or paint a picture? It's not like these skills are gonna help us in real life. I'd rather learn something useful like math or science. At least then I could use it to get a good job and make some money.

So yeah, I think music, drama, and art classes should be electives. It's just not worth it.

"There are pros and cons for both whywe should keep and get rid of the Electoral college.

You are voting for the electors, not the president. Voters don't get to choose the electors. Some electors might even defy the wishes of the people who voted for them. There are 538 electoral votes, which is an even number so their could be a tie.

It is rare that eletors will defy the wishes of the voters, but it has happened. In 2000 Gore had a high percentage of the popular vote than electoral votes. This is so rare that the only other time that it happened was in 1888. Most states give electoral votes on a winner-takes-all basis, some split the votes a little bit, because of this there is a clear winner. In the case of electoral votes, no one region of the United States can win alone, so the votes are spread out. If presidential elections were decided directly by the popular vote than region favorites would be elected abd the rest of the voters would feel that they did'nt vote for the president that was elected. Presidential candidates are most likely to campaign in ""swing states"" that they know they cn win the electoral votes from. Voters in these states are most likely to pay close attention to both candidates, so the most thoughtful voters will get the most representation. The most populated states or the ""big states"" get the most electoral votes, meaning the states with the most people the the most representation. With the Electoral College you increase your chances of having a majority (fifty percent or more). While there can be a tie, this is rare.

Since there are good arguements on both sides, a decision has to be made after careful thought.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Aliens may or may not be real, but if they were they could not make this. I know this is just a natural landform. Yes it is weird that this landform looks like a face i agree with that, but saying aliens made it is just crazy. Here are some reasons on how i know and can prove that aliens did not make this.

First if aliens did make this how could they make it. They had to have some kind of machine or something they couldn't have just built it with there hands. So if they did make it we would of seen how like some machine like i said before. Also they would of left some kind of foot mark or something they couldn't have and not left a single mark.

The second reason is if aliens made it don't you find it weird that it looks like a human face. Where or how would they get the idea of making it look like our faces. The only way they could do that is if they went to earth and saw our faces there and if there aliens on earth NASA would be the first to know.

The third reason is in unmasking the face on mars it says in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform common around the American West."" Then to prove it even more it says this. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an islolated mesa about the SAME height as the face in mar."" So that just said that these ""faces"" are common around the American West and I'm pretty sure aliens are not on earth. So unless aliens came to earth made a face and then left without NASA seeing it would be impossible.

These are my 3 reasons on why i think it is impossible that aliens made it. It's just a natural form. I am not saying aliens are not real but i am saying that they did not make this face without us seeing it.              ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Why should anyone want to have a car drive you anywhere you want to go when you can drive yourself? You should be the one in control of the car not the other way around, there could be a malfunction with the car that might cause a wreak, and they don't need more technology to a car, because at the end of the day your not going to have it all of your life. I'm against having the google car, because who needs a literally has laser beams that comes out of the top of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings.

You should be the one in control of the car at all times. A person learns how to drive for a reason. They learn how to drive, so that their parents don't have to anymore, to maybe go places by yourself, and just to swee how well you have learned to drive and how much you have improved before you started to drive in the first place. Having a human drive you is better than a robot driving you because you have an advantage of learning and continuing how to learn how.

Having malfunctions is a big problem. there is alot that can happen to you if you manage to mess something up or if you just crash and wreak your car. You can push a button that can do some serious harm to you or anyone that is in the car at the time, you can break some bones by cracking into another car or a tree, and it can make you have some type of brain damage. Having malfunctions are bad, but dying in the process of your vehicle having a malfunction is horrible.

"Technology has become an integral part of our lives in recent years. It has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and even think. While technology has brought numerous benefits to people's lives, it has also had some negative effects. In this essay, I will discuss the positive and negative effects of technology on people's lives and conclude with my opinion.

On the positive side, technology has made our lives easier and more convenient in many ways. For example, technology has made it possible for us to communicate with people from all over the world in real-time. We can easily send messages, emails, and even videos to our friends and family. Additionally, technology has made it easier for us to access information. With a few clicks, we can find answers to our questions, research topics, and even learn new skills. Technology has also made it possible for us to work from anywhere, making it easier for us to balance work and personal life.

On the negative side, technology has also brought some challenges to people's lives. For example, technology has made it easier for people to become addicted to social media and other forms of technology. This addiction can lead to social isolation, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to become lazy and rely too heavily on technology, which can lead to a lack of physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle. Technology has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.

In my opinion, the positive effects of technology on people's lives outweigh the negative effects. While technology has brought some challenges to people's lives, it has also brought numerous benefits. For example, technology has made it possible for us to communicate with people from all over the world, access information easily, and work from anywhere. However, it is essential to use technology responsibly and be aware of its potential negative effects. We must strive to balance our use of technology with other aspects of our lives, such as physical activity and face-to-face communication.

In conclusion, technology has brought both positive and negative effects to people's lives. While technology has made our lives easier and more convenient, it has also brought some challenges. It is essential to use technology responsibly and be aware of its potential negative effects. By doing so, we can ensure that technology continues to bring benefits to our",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"As I'm running across the field with the wind against my face. The ball moving faster than me. I spot an opponent on a right. I sped up towards the goal. I lift my leg and shoot and my ball hits the net within second. The crowd cheering my teammates gathered around me. We just won the first championship game for Generic_School. This is commonly known as extracurricular activities that are offered and put together by the schools. We should be able to participate in yearbook staff, team sports or any extracurricular activities.

One of the reasons we should have these activities for students is because they can improve social skills. For example if you were running down the court and your teammate on the other side you can communicate to them ""Pass I'm open!"". According to activitesforstudents. org having children and students be on a team can improve many things teamwork abilities,social skills, along with confidence. But some people argue that having these teams and a type of competitiveness which can cause kids to be rude and be unkind to the other teammates who they think is ""not good enough"". A true story from americanantibullysociety. org. about a young boy who was home schooled and very shy. He later came to public school where he sat alone at lunch and didnt talk to anyone. A few months later he joined the yearbook staff. He became very social and everyone wanted to be his friend. He later realized that having these connections at school is a necessity. This really puts in perspective why we should have extracurricular activities.

Another reason that we should have this rule is because it can help you become more involved with the school system. An article titled ""Children need extracurricular activities!"" claims that doing these activities can decrease the number of children and teens led into mental problems or social skills. A website called USAschools. com stated that in just the last year the number of kids who arent in activities at school end up being indoors and isolating themselves which could lead to no friends and could lead to larger more severe problems. Having these activities will attract more students to join new schools if they have good sport teams or any of there other interests.

Some people argue that school should only be for academics. There wrong because although schools are for learning new concepts in math,science, civics and more doesnt mean students should not have the opportunity to join a yearbook staff or a sports team. on the other hand, maybe we shouldnt have these activities because the schools already put enough money into teaching kids do we need to spend more money on this activities?

I think that we should have this rule because these activities help in so many ways not just inside of school but outside to! We should be able to participate in yearbook staff, team sports or any extracurricular activities.

"I agree with the statement saying that we should use this technology of emotional expressions because it could help people with knowing what is gong on with the person's personal life. Even though kids would not like it it should be brought to use because there can't be anymore drepression into kids life.

First reason why I think we should use technology like this is because it says that, ""even though individuals often shwo varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly."" This means that if we start using this type of technology we can figure out if a person is good or bad. Another reason why we should use this technology is because it says, ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait taht conveys happy, worried, etc."" This could mean that even if you might know what they feel you could most possilbe be wrong because if they look happy that does not mean they are actually happy they could be sad in the inside of their body. Then finally my last reason is they used the Mona Lisa smile as a demonstration. Then it said, ""The Mona Lisa demonstartion is really intended to bring a smile to your face... Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" This means this technology can detect if you are actually happy or sad.

In conclusion, I agree with this kind of technology because it can help people understanding other people's feelings. It could also demonstration how fast time is going by technology. Also, what technology can do nowadays.   ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, so I've been thinking a lot about Thomas Jefferson's idea of hard work and never giving up. Like, he was like a total genius and all, but I'm not sure if I could actually do all that hard work and stuff. I mean, I'm pretty good at math and stuff, but I get tired easily and stuff. But, like, he was like a total pioneer and stuff, and he helped make America what it is today. So, I guess it's worth looking into his ideas and stuff.

So, like, one of the biggest benefits of following Thomas Jefferson's idea of hard work and never giving up is that it can help you achieve your goals. Like, he was a total visionary and he had a lot of big ideas, but he never gave up on them. And look where it got him! He became the third President of the United States! That's like, super impressive. And if you work hard and never give up, you can achieve anything you want. It's like, the sky's the limit or something.

But, like, there are also some drawbacks to following his idea. For one thing, it can be really, really hard. Like, he was a total workaholic and he worked all the time. And I'm like, I get tired just thinking about it. I don't know if I could do that every day. And plus, it's not just about working hard, it's also about being smart and stuff. Like, he was a total genius and he knew a lot of stuff. I'm like, I'm not sure if I could ever be as smart as him.

So, like, I don't know if I could totally follow Thomas Jefferson's idea of hard work and never giving up. But, like, it's definitely something to think about. Maybe I could try to work harder and stuff, but also take breaks and not overdo it. And maybe I could also try to learn more stuff and be more smart like him. That would be pretty cool.

Anyway, that's my essay. I hope you liked it. Let me know what you think",1,llama2_chat,1
"When facing a difficult decision, it is important to get many different opinions on the subject. What sports teams to try out for, what classes to take, and where to go to college are all big decisions in a person's life. Getting multiple peoples' responses will help with decision making by seeing the issue from other viewpoints, avoiding mistakes that have already been made, and reaching the most unbiased consensus.

To one person, a choice can sometimes seem only black and white, however getting advice from others can change this. Each person who is asked will have different experiences and biases affecting the advice they will give. People also play different roles in society, and those roles yield other viewpoints that would not have otherwise been considered. Discussing decisions with peers will bring more sides to an issue, and, in turn, help the person make a more informed choice.

Along with adding viewpoints, avoiding mistakes that have already been made will be achieved by talking with others. Some may have faced similar problems and can share the positives and negatives of each side. Along with this, personal experiences may show one decision will have many other consequences that were not previously taken into account. After reaching a final decision, the choice made will have less unpredicted side effects and it will avoid bad decisions that have been made by others in the past.

As well as seeing topics from other sides and avoiding similar mistakes, discussing choices with friends will produce the least biased decision. Each person asked will have a different opinion and bias on a subject based on prior events. If only one person is consulted, their bias may have a larger effect on the outcome, but something that happened to that person may not apply to that situation. The more people that are asked, the more clear it will be on which outcomes are common, and should be most avoided.

Choices can affect people for a long time and in order to make sure the best decision is being made, it is necessary talk with other people. Getting new advice will add different viewpoints, help avoid similar mistakes that have been made in the past, and bring people to a less biased agreement. Seeking many opinions can help someone make the best choice for them.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

i think that students should have to perform at least two hours of community service. i think that they can spare at least two hours and if they cant spare two hours one hour will be fine to help people that need help. if they needed that help then they would want someone to help them. it doesn't even have to be a hard job it can be picking up litter in you community or helping out kids that need a little extra help in school, or maybe helping out at the senior center or if you like animals then you can volunteer at the animal shelter because they need a lot of help and you will be helping the animals at the same time who knows maybe they will even like it a lot and volunteer there full time. if i had to give up two hours of my day to help someone then i would because i might like it i think that if we do, do community service then we should get something in return not something big but something. it would be a great change in the school. i think that if you made every kid in the school do community service that a lot of people would sign up and volunteer. plus if you get all your friends to do it then you and your friends can be spending time together but still helping out other people and having fun all at the same time. i think that everyone should try it because some people enjoy helping others and for the people that don't have the time i think that if they try this program then they will start to like it and they would have never known. you should try it and see what happens i bet you a lot of people would sign up. and who knows maybe you will too. thank you for reading this letter.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable in some ways and some not because a computer knowing when your happy or sad could be beneficial in your classroom. For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad will follow. But if you frown, the next ad wll be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. But I bet your lab partner could recognize if you are happy, sad, or mad. Its all about muscular action units. They indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile. In a real smile the muscles that begin at your cheek bones lift the corners of your mouth. In a false smile, the mouth is strecthed sideways. Muscle clues are sometimes important. Which is why I think that this technology is better off not being useful in classes because you can detect a person being happy, sad, or mad by yourself by muscle clues. To an expert, faces dont lie.

"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Sometimes people ask for advice from other people to get their opinions, for example it helps find your decision, how to execute your decision, and to know what to do afterwords. It is good to get other peoples opinions so do not be scared to ask.

The first thing getting other peoples opinions helps with is finding your decision. It helps finding your decision by finding what you agree with. Finding out what your going to do is the most important thing to do. When someone asks you for advice don't give them bad advice, because the situation could be very important.

The second thing getting advice from more than one person helps with is figuring out how your going to execute your decision. This is somewhat important depending on the situation. When going through with the decision if it could hurt the person let them down easy. When figuring out how to deal with the problem go with what you feel is right not just what other people say.

The third and final thing on my list is finding out what to do afterwords. This isn't as important as the other two things. Depending of if the situation is family or friends changes the level of importance. When you execute the choice don't get depressed and turn to drugs or alcohol turn to your friends who always have your back.

sometimes it's good to talk to other people for advice not just one person. people ask for advice from multiple people to help find their decision, how to execute the choice, and to know what to do afterwords. people who are sensitive need better advice than others and a shoulder to lean on after they do it. this was my opinion on what the subject was on.

"Thesis: Disagreeing on having to participate in atleast one extracurricular activity.

There's alot of extracurricurricular actiivitys you can participate in , but some people don't like to participate in activity's. Some of them can be boring making people not want to do them. Then theres some people that love doing activitys like that. It shouldn't be up to the principal if they want to participate in them or not.

There is just some people that can't participate in things like sports , if doing extracurricular activitys could help peoples grades then i think the people that aren't interested in doing them would be more interested then. But for now they're just for fun and now days teenagers just want to hangout with friends and be on their phone. There is some people that barely get to spend time with their family because they're so busy so they don't have time for activitys.

With sports being a extracurricular activity there is some people that can't afford is because it can be exspincve and some kids/families don't have the money for that. Theres some kids that would love to do things like sports , but don't have transpartion or money and some schools don't always have rides for students to get back and forth.

Some students can't participate in things like that because they get in to much trouble *they only do it like that at some schools*

I don't really see a point of having to do a extracrricular activity theres just no point. I don't think trying it once would hurt to see if you like it or not! If our principal made us do this i feel like it should be once a mouth because other people have other things to do and are busy , and i feel like the students should be able to pick what activity they want to do or not. And the teachers should put it in as a grade if they participate or not.

"The planets are a fasinating part of science. They have charateristics that we can not even imagine and facts that we long to learn about. The mask that apeared on Mars was first spotted in the year of 1976. I can strongly say that the face on Mars is not created by aliens. I know this because scientists figured that is was a butte or mesa- landforms that are common around the American West. Also when they shot the pictures it was taken during winter when it is normanly cloudly, not a good time to take a photo.

The face on Mars is not a alien creation, but is a Marian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. This implies that the science behind this, is that the landform on Mars is non other than a mesa. Scientist also know that mesa landforms are common enough, especially around Cydonia. This shows that the unusual formation was definatly a butte, but this one just happened to make it look like a face.

In 1976 a Viking shot a photo of a face like portrait. This was taken during winter a cloudy time of the year. This demonstrates that this picture is not the most reliable photograph. And so On April 5, 1998 a team of MOC researchers went out a took a sharper photo,much more reliable thean the original Vikings photo. This reveils that the landform was very much a natural landform. Though this rock formation did very much resemble a human head, We know that this mesa was created by shadows not aliens.

The face on Mars show us that things may appear different from what they seem. Next time lets just leave it to the experts to tell us the science behind things.     ",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Being Inactive: A Double-Edged Sword

In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life. We're constantly on the go, whether it's rushing to school, work, or extracurricular activities. However, it's important to remember that being inactive can serve a purpose, as long as it's done in moderation. In this essay, I will examine three key benefits of being inactive, explain how it can be beneficial in small doses, give an example of a time when inactivity helped me complete tasks, and investigate how hiring a butler or household assistant can help with inactivity.

Firstly, being inactive can provide much-needed rest. In our busy lives, it's easy to overlook the importance of rest. However, it's essential for our physical and mental health. When we're inactive, our bodies are able to repair and rejuvenate, which can lead to increased productivity and energy levels when we're back on the go. For example, after a long day at school, it's important to take some time to relax and unwind. This could mean watching TV, reading a book, or simply taking a nap. By giving ourselves permission to be inactive, we're allowing our bodies to rest and recover.

Secondly, being inactive can be a great way to catch up on TV shows or movies. In today's digital age, there are countless streaming services available that allow us to watch our favorite shows and movies at the touch of a button. This can be a great way to unwind and relax after a long day. For example, after finishing a particularly challenging math test, I decided to take a break and watch an episode of my favorite TV show. This allowed me to decompress and clear my mind before diving back into studying.

Lastly, being inactive can be a great way to hire a butler or household assistant. While this may seem like an extravagant luxury, it can actually be quite beneficial. A butler or household assistant can take care of tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and running errands, which can free up valuable time for other activities. For example, if you have a busy work schedule, hiring a butler or household assistant can help",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Have you ever wondered how people were feeling emotionally? ""Profesor Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Profesor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam"" (paragraph 1). These two scientists are working on a software that can recognize emotions. This software could change the world in many ways.

This interesting software could help create better ways for humans and computers to communicate with one another. In the article it states, ""Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"" (paragraph 2). I believe that this technology will improve the world. There are thousands of murderers and testifiers that take tests to see if they are lying. With this emotion senser software they will be able to calculate more accurately. When the bad guys are behind bars the people are safest.

The design of this software will be like nothing seen before. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model move like human muscles"" (paragraph 3). This quote may sound really desturbing, but it will change the world. There are millions of hackers world wide and the question is does this make our identify safe or are we at more risk? In most cases you have to give a little to get a little. Yes there are terrible things that could go wrong with this software, but I believe it's for the greater good.

Even without this software today we can still tell how the people around us are feeling but looking at their facial expressions. ""In fact, we humans preform this same impressive 'calculation' every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply by the look on her face"" (paragraph 5). I value this techology for all the good it will do in order to get the bad people away from the good.

After reading this very interesting article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" I stand to value this software for the future. There are so many wonderful things this software will be able to. Either by helping with murder cases or just knowing how someone is feeling. It is so amazing that these scientists are coming up with this fantastic software. I can not wait to see what they have in store for the world itself.   ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Phones & Driving

Phones and driving are two bad combinations. They can lead to serious danger and harm.

People must be careful on now they use their phones while driving as it can lead to major accidents or worse. I think drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Cell phones are major distraction when driving. People/drivers can't help but to pick them up and use them. This could keep the drivers focus off the main thing which would be paying attention to the road. In these cases it could potentially be dangerous as they could cause an accident.

Next texting is also another reason why cell phones shouldn't be in the drivers capacity. Drivers often check their phones for messages or calls. This causes the driver to take his/her eyes off the road and cause an accident in a split second. The highest number of accidents come from texting and driving. This can is a major problem.

Finally music is also a problem as most times the driver don't listen to the radio as they more than often listen to the bluetooth connected to the phone. The driver may not want to listen to a certain song and try to change it which would make him/her take their eyes off the road. It could also lead to them getting badly injured.

In conclusion driving with phones is bad. We must try not to use phones as much as possible when driving it may save our lives as well as others. Doing this could also bring the accident percentage down. This could save thousands of lives maybe even more.         ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Self-reliance is a vital quality that can greatly benefit individuals in various aspects of their lives. Being able to rely on oneself and make decisions without relying on others can lead to increased confidence, independence, and problem-solving skills.

One of the most important aspects of self-reliance is the use of common sense. Having the ability to think critically and make sound decisions based on practical experience and knowledge can help individuals navigate challenging situations. For example, if a person is lost in the woods, they can use their common sense to find their way back to civilization by following landmarks, observing the sun, and using their senses to detect potential dangers.

Another important aspect of self-reliance is experience. The more a person experiences life, the more they will be able to rely on their own judgment and skills to handle difficult situations. For instance, a person who has experience camping in the wilderness will be better equipped to handle unexpected weather conditions or injuries than someone who has never been camping before.

Finally, independence is a key aspect of self-reliance. Being able to take care of oneself and not relying on others for everything can lead to a greater sense of autonomy and self-sufficiency. For example, a person who is able to fix their own car or repair their own home will be less likely to have to rely on others for help, which can lead to a greater sense of independence.

However, there is also a counterclaim to the value of self-reliance. Some argue that relying on oneself can lead to a lack of social skills and an inability to work well with others. For example, a person who is too independent may have difficulty collaborating with others on a project or asking for help when they need it.

To illustrate this counterclaim, consider the example of a person who is a skilled mechanic. While they may be able to fix their own car, they may struggle to work with a team of mechanics to diagnose and repair a complex problem. In this case, the person's self-reliance can actually hinder their ability to solve the problem.

In conclusion, self-reliance is a valuable quality that can lead to increased confidence, independence, and problem-solving skills. While there are some potential drawbacks",1,llama2_chat,4
"Dear principal ...

wrote this letter to tell you that it is completely unfair that you would change the school policy to it being that you have to have a grade B average to be in sports or other activities like that. First of all most of the kid in the school don't even have a grade B- average to start with so that means that there will be lesser kids in the different clubs or activities so they will have to shut it down and the kids will start leaving the school because there are no good clubs in the school, and then school will sooner or later shut down.

I guess i could see the reason why you would change the policy you might think kid will try harder to get a B average and maybe some kid might but those are only the kids whose parents will not let them change schools but over all that might be at least 26 percent of the kids who have lower than a B average and is definitely not going to be enough to keep the clubs or the school open. i really how you put to mind what i have to say.

"Have you ever wondered what it would be like if humans didn't have to control the car? I think driveless cars is a good idea but at some time humans will have to take over. I say this because it would be less acidents, there will be less tickets , and people without lisences can't drive.

One reason why I think it's a good idea is because it will be less acidents. The computer will know what to do in different situations. And i think they should have a monitor on when the computer drives and when the person drives. At what place and what time. Then you will know who to blame for any acidents.

Another reason why i think it's a good idea is because there will be less tickets. If the car knows what speed limit to go or when to stop then there would be no problem with running past lights and stop signs. And you can't lie about it was the computer because it follows the rules , and they have it monitered on the car.

My last reason is because there is a lot of people out there that doesn't have a lisents and they are still driving. If you have to show your lisents or put it into somewhere so the computer knows you are allowed to drive than there wouldn't be a problem.

"Most kids don't like school as it is and its boring to them. The student-designed summer project would be better in their favor Because studens don't get to say much besides ask questions, and They have more say and more of a voice, and not every student learns the same, and summer is better than the school year because you can do more outside activities.

The project would be great for students to learn and have fun because you can do things like have a lessons with the activities where the kids can pick between thing because not all kids like everything to be just told to them. kids feel better when they can have fun and everything isn't crammed in their brains for 7 hours a day. Which would make them tired and not ready to learn. This would be perfect for students who are hands on type of learners. They can be hands on because the project is student based. Not every kid learns the same so kids who learn differently would be more comfortable because its not a 7 hour classroom environment where they just sit in class all day.

Student would have more say or more of a voice because is about them.

During the school year in the fall and winter because the teacher basically run the class and they teach they way they want and the kids just listen. By making the project student based students can present thier feelings and their feedback about what they like and don't like. It can also help teacher get a better undestanding about their students. They can also create bonds with new people such as students and teachers. Nobody want to be taught by a teacher they don't like. This will cause kids not being motivated to learn from the teacher and will probably cause bad behavior.

The project willalso make kid have more fun and they'll probably like school. You can do more activies that kids will like, like going to the pool, or planning a picnic, or just playing on a playground. You could make it so that it could be a lesson in each activity. Then they will learn while having fun. It wold be a win for everyone. It can just belittle insintives that they can get because of the weather and little brain breaks so they dont get overwelmed. Students already don't like going to school and making it fun and in their favor will make them want to come.

So if we lengthen school hours, they'll have to work even more. And they might get burned out, you know? They might not be able to teach us as well. Plus, they have families and stuff too, and they might not want to spend more time at school.

And then there are us students. I mean, we're already in school for like, eight hours a day. That's a long time! If we add more hours, we'll be even more tired and grumpy. And we won't be able to do things we want to do, like play sports or hang out with our friends. And think about homework! If we have more school hours, we'll have even more homework. That's just not fair.

But some people say that if we lengthen school hours, we'll learn more. Like, they think we'll get more done in less time if we're in school longer. But I don't think that's true. I mean, I learn stuff in school, but I also learn stuff outside of school. Like, I learn stuff from my parents and my friends and stuff. And if we're in school longer, we won't have as much time to learn stuff from other people.

So, what can we do instead of lengthening school hours? Well, maybe we can have more breaks during the day. Like, we could have a longer lunch break or something. Or we could have more time for extracurricular activities. Like, we could have sports or clubs or something. That way, we can still learn stuff and have fun, but we won't be in school as long.

So, that's my opinion on lengthening school hours. I think it's not a good idea.",1,llama2_chat,4
"There's a new trend that has been developing for years now, and soon will be in full throttle affect. The mass amount of polution being produced world-wide over the years has been at terrifying levels, up until the last five to ten years. Although not the first cause of the polution, gases emitted from transportation is the second largest contributer to this ""green house gas"" issue going on, according to source 4. An idea to hinder this growing issue and potentially put the polution levels at a decline is the effort to limit personal car usage. By doing this, we inhabitants of the world are able to help clear the air, reduce congestion on the streets, and live a simpler, more cost efficient lifestyle.

Polution, as we know, is an ongoing trend that is proving lethal to our environment. Factories and power plants are the number one cause of polution in the world. This is almost inevitable, since we have yet to develop a way to produce in mass amounts in a clean way. However, what we can have a part in is limiting the personal car usage to promote cleaner air. Public transportation, carpooling, and hybrid/electric cars have been seen as the alternative to owning personal cars. Those options are also seen as the solution, considering their contribution to the act since ""the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak [of 2005]"" (source 4). Reducing the amout of miles driven links to the amout of dangerous gases emitted into the air, therefor ""having cleaner air.""

Rush hour traffic is obnoxious and is the least fun part of driving. Encouraging people to drive less and either walk, bike, or use public transportation will help end the long waits sitting bumper-to-bumper on the roads. In France, a study was done where fines were placed on people who drove by themselves or with only one passenger (excluding hybrids and ""plug in"" cars). According to the source, ""congestion was down 60 percent."" Just a week of not driving with personal (gasoline or diesel) cars proved to be extremely beneficial in clearing out the streets, making for easier courses to work. The concept is truly simple. We use less cars, there's less people on the street, and you can get to and fro much faster and without hassle. Reducing the number of cars on the street is also a goodway to inspire motor companies to be inventive. Losing business will ultimately result in extermination of the business, unless the corporation is able to come up with new products to satisfy the consumer. Mitsubishi is a automotive company that also makes air conditioners. According to source 4, Ford and Mercedes are ""rebranding"" themselves to comply with the new trend.

Almost everyone wants to live a clean, healthy and simple lifestyle and participation in limiting the number of cars driven daily is a very easy way to do so. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, said,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (source 1). This refers to the successful suburban trial in Vauban, Germany to no longer own cars. Parking on the street, personal garages, and driveways in general are seen as taboo in the living district near France and Switzerland's border (source 1). Very few people own cars, let alone drive them. Not only does lowering the usage of cars help the environment and make the journey to wherever you're going much less complicated, it also initiates the restoration of things considered not as important such as sidewalks, parks, and public transport systems. The more people using the utilities, the more cities will fund them and make the experience more enjoyable. In Bogata, the ""day without cars"" campaign has led to 118 miles of bycle paths being constructed (source 3). The chain of events will lead to more and more people utilizing their bikes and feet to get around, instead of cars.

Driving used to be considered the most popular way to get around town from point A to point B and back. But now, with a push to limit personal car usage, a positive switch is happening to where more and more people are no longer relying on their vehicles to move about-instead bikes, subways and buses, and even just our own two feet are our means of transportation. This ""smart planning"" reduces green house gases along with traffic congestion, and also promotes a simpler, healthier lifestyle.                                                                                                                                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"It is known that asking multiple people for advice is more efficient than just asking one person, because it allows poeple to have a more open mindset and have a different perspective on the circumstance. Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice is a smart idea because people will get diverse opinions on the situation, people will hear out how the other person feels about the scenario, and the person will obtain more advice to consider.

Having a open mindset when taking advice from someone else is key. If a person is offering someone advice, they should take it or at least listen to what the other person has to say because most likely they are just trying to help. People should always hear the other person out even if its something small because they may have a point. When going to ask for advce try to think of people who are not as similar as yourself, because they can give you a outlook on your situation that may be very helpful. Going to people that are not as similar to your personality will have a blind outlook of the situation which means that their advice may be slightly more brutal and honest compared to someone who has the same personality traits as yourself. So if your interested in getting honest advice, I would advise going to someone who is considered to be opisite of your personality.

Of course when asking multiple people for advice you're going to get a lot of different opinions, and reactions to your situation. I would start by asking the people you're closest with then slowy move out of your comfort zone to the people that dont seem as similar. I would do that just so people can seek more honest opinions other than your friend group that knows everything about your life. When you're recieving the advice take it into consideration and how it may affect your future. By that I mean your future life, your future decisions, your future feelings. Just think about all of those things after you hear advice from people and really think hard and consider what the best route for your life would be.

If your asking for advice go to people your obtaining trust with but also people that are honest, because you're going to want to have honest opinions that will benefit your life. I think after getting all the advice your brain thinks that it needs, I would use the 3 C's. Clarify, consider, and choose. Clarify your current situation ( what you've been getting advice on. ) Consider all of the opinions, feedback, and advice that was given to yourself. And go through and choose which advice would be most beneficial to your current lifestyle.

Getiing diverse opinions and viewing your situation from other perspectives are both good reasons why people should seek multiple advice and opinions from many different types of people. People will get the opurtunity to hear out what other people have to say about their situation, and they will obtain more advice by asking more people which most likely will be beneficial to whoever is asking for the advice.   ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"In today's fast-paced world, people are constantly striving to be productive and efficient. However, the question remains whether being constantly active or taking breaks is more beneficial in achieving these goals. In my opinion, a combination of both approaches is necessary to accomplish more in life.

Firstly, staying on track in school is crucial to academic success. Students who are constantly active and engaged in their studies tend to perform better academically. They are more likely to attend class, complete assignments on time, and participate in extracurricular activities. However, it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to rest and recharge. Taking a break from studying can help prevent burnout and improve focus and productivity when we return to our work.

Secondly, working hard like a parent is essential to achieving personal and professional goals. Parents who are constantly active and engaged in their children's lives tend to have more successful children. They are more likely to be involved in their children's education, provide a stable home environment, and set a good example for their children to follow. Similarly, individuals who work hard and are constantly active in their careers tend to achieve more success and advancement opportunities. However, it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to relax and recharge. Taking a break from work can help prevent burnout and improve job satisfaction when we return to our work.

Finally, getting things done like a soccer player requires a combination of both approaches. Soccer players who are constantly active and engaged in their training tend to perform better on the field. They are more likely to practice regularly, stay in shape, and develop their skills. However, it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to rest and recover. Taking a break from training can help prevent injuries and improve performance when we return to our training.

In conclusion, being constantly active or taking breaks is necessary to accomplish more in life. A combination of both approaches is necessary to achieve success in school, work, and other areas of life. It is important to find a balance between being active and taking breaks to prevent burnout and improve productivity. By understanding the importance of both approaches, we can achieve our goals and lead a fulfilling life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Have you ever gotten into a conflict with someone and you took into your own hands, but it didn't go too well?

Everyone gets into arguments, it's what make us humans. Most people have a mindset that says, ""it's either my way or the highway."" Having that way of thinking can be good in some cases, but in others not so much.

I believe that a person should take advice from others because it can help you see other perspectives, not take your own bias, and learn from the situation.

Seeing a different perspective on the situation is good because it tells you other ways of doing things that you never considered trying. Many people have probably been in that same situation and can tell you what they did. Hearing what other people have done can expand your mind into doing something totally different from what you were intending to do, which can be good. I remember a time where I was in a conflict with my friend, and didn't know how to handle it. I asked others to help me find a way to try getting my friend back, and they gave me some suggestions. Using their insight helped me get my friend back.

Not taking your own opinion is good because most of the time we think that we are always right. Which can make it hard to take others knowledge. Not taking your own bias can help by letting you break from your comfort zone, expanding into doing something you don't often do. For some, it's apologizing. When mutiple people tell you what they would've done it gives you any idea of what to do. Which can make it easier if you weren't too sure about your orginal one.

Learning from the situation is always better because it can help you grow as a person. For example, if someone gets into a fight with someone and they get suspended they learn that fighting others can result in a bad consequence. It's better to take the learning part with you throughout life because it can benefit you when others ask for your opinion on the same or a similar topic. As a result, you can get a more positive outcome, and less likely of a negative.

In conclusion, we should seek for mutiple opinons because it can benefit you in a more positive way. Seeking insight from others can be better for you by helping you see other perspectives, not taking your own bias, and learn from the situation. Others have different ways of thinking so taking a bit of that knowledge to better yourself for the future can be good. Not everyone thinks what you were intending to do would've turned out good, but that's just more of a reason to seek others opinions. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"For the past two decades we as citizens have been trying to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, with little or no change. A major conductor of greenhouse gases would be automoblies also known as cars. For example France, cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel made up 67 percent of vehicles in France, which was blamed for causing five-days of intensifying smog that rivaled even Beijing, China; Which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

In an article ""

Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, It tells about Vauban, a town occupied with 5,500 residents in Germany where locals have given up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district and Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter a local resident of the town.

Vauban serves as a great example on how the majority of world should be. The time to take action is now. Reducing car usage can benefit the world around us globally, less pollution equals a cleaner world we live in meaning a better environment. Things like ""A day without a car"" should be global holiday. In ""

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota

"" by Andrew Selsky it describes how Bogota, Colombia had a day without cars that helped promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.

Cars are the main source of greenhouse gas emissions and need to be put on a limit.

They produce pollution that is not only bad for the earth, but bad for our health as well. A solution to reduce cars emissions is having holidays in which no one can use cars and use other forms of transportation like bus or bike. It is important that we take action and aim for a better, cleaner tomorrow.                            ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Its a great idea to have something read what your're feeling. That way teachers can know what there students are feeling. That can also help the teacher to find ways to help the student.

The person reading the other person feelings can know how that person is feel so that way they can help them out. Like if the person is feeling sad,mad,or similar feelings like that they will know that they have to try to find a way to cheer them up.

This would be a great expirces that teachers can try and also students,other people. Peolpe can learn new things like how to cheer up a friend. Or how to make someone feel better.

"Allowing students to take classes online would be extremely beneficial. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way of online or video conferencing. Offering online classes to students would benefit them because some students may have to stay home to help out their family, it would allow students to learn more during summer to get ahead, and it gives students the ability to pursue multiple majors or classes at once.

Some students might be going through struggles in their home and are not able to go to school. For example, someones family member may be really sick and they must stay home to help them. Providing online classes would allow these students, who cannot go to school, to learn more. Another example may be the student needs to stay home to work and provide money for his family because they are not as fortunate. These students only way to learn would be from online classes if they are not able to go to school and dont know anyone who would be their teacher. Therefor, online classes should be offered in as many schools as possible to provide for all the students who cannot go to school.

Students who want to get ahead of their peers in the academic seen may want to take classes online during their summer. Taking classes in the summer would give students a jump ahead and allow them to take a more advanced class in school the following year. For example, I took academic math back in sixth grade and it put me behind in math, which is one of my better subjects, so I decided to take algebra over the summer in eighth so I could go into geometry when I got to high school. Distance learning really gives students the ability to get ahead if they decide to put the extra work in and work during their time off. I also think students should take advantage of online classes over the summer because they do not take nearly as long as the normal class would and it can bump you ahead.

Lastly, providing online classes to students would give them the ability to pursue multiple majors or classes at once. I know of many people who got a double major in college and online classes make that much easier. With all the free time some students have they could spend some of it working on another class online and gradually try to achieve a second major or put them ahead. Multiple majors give a person the power to pursue multiple fields of work to greater their chances of getting the best and most enjoyable job they possible can. Also, multiple schools offer online classes so a person can try to find the best school for that major or class and get the online class from there, if available.

Although providing online classes would allow more people to learn and grow their brain, I do believe it is more beneficial for a student to be working in school than from home. I think being in the school atmosphere has less distractions and is more demanding of your commitment. For example, working from home provides more distractions and the student has no one to enforce them to turn in their work. However, offering distance learning would allow people who cannot go to school learn, which would increase the worlds educated. Also, I believe online classes are the greatest way for students to get ahead and start trying to get into a good college early. Finally, online classes would allow the very dedicated students learn multiple classes or majors at once. Therefor, online classes should be always be offered until they come up with a more efficient way to learn from home.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"When asking for advice, you don't always hear what you would like. Everyone has their own opinion ,but some can lead you to good or bad things; really depends on the person. You should go to the people you trust the most or feel most comfortable. Asking more than one person for advice can bring you up by giving you good ideas and helping your future. There are many other reason why asking other people for advice and these are my reasons .

There are many people in world who don't want the best for you even without knowing you ; thats why you should go to the people you can trust the most or have a close bond with. When asking one person you clearly get one opinion ,but maybe its best asking other people for their opinion on whatever situtation it is. Seeking other peoples opinion can really effect you . Having support can be a big thing in someones life and showing it can really show that you want the best for them. Supporting your friend to a good desicion is always helpful because being by their side can really show your true colors . If don't have anyone to talk to it can really bring you down and keep everything bottled up. When most people give advice they dont really think of the situtation thats why asking more people can be extremly helpful. I understand if you don't get the situtation because you might not know what to say , or your just not putting your in their position, but as long as you supporting them thats all that matters .

Seeking peoples true colors can also make you see who they really are . If the person or people or whoever you ask for advice is making you do a bad thing or get things in your head maybe that person just doesn't care or could careless of you . Seeing the way that they treat you or talk to you can make you think twice or multiple times ; good or bad. Some can lead you to your future, and you should really keep them in your life because those are the type of people ,you want to be positive . Advice is a big thing that you may not realize but you use it everyday like for example ,"" do you like my outfit"" , "" does this taste good "" etc. The little things you dont realize are the ones you use everyday.

Now lastly the people . You may not notice but we are all pretty cool in our own way or just pretty mean . The people that surround us are the people we know ; yes you may not be friends with them but atleast you know them or you might have heard something about them . Getting advice from the people you dont know personally isn't the best idea . Close friends , family members , consulers are the best to talk to even if you ask others. Like I said advice is just something we all use no matter what, but know that we have support is the best feeling you'll ever get.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"To the principal

You have said that you want to change the school policy so that students must have a B average to play sports. But I would like to disagree with that. The sports players play for the school. What I'm trying to say is even though they don't make good grades they may be grate at the sport they play.

The school is in some ways represented by there sports teams and I think that if they do not win games they will be known as a push over and not a good school. You should not need to be perfect to play a sport. To play a sport it just takes willingness and want to be good at that sport.

I'm not saying that students shouldn't make good grades they should but if that student is doing his or her best in school and just making a C average they should still allow that student to play sports and represent his or her school.

"Operating a cellular device at the same time as handling a vehicle is so dangerous, due to texting and driving becoming the leading cause of death among teenage drivers, one out of every four car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving, that boils down to roughly eight people being killed each day and roughly one thousands one hundred and sixty-one injuries in crashes that involved distracted driving.

Texting and driving appears to be a significant problem among young drivers. Studies show that drivers on a mobile phone reduce their visual scanning of the road ahead, are more likely to weave within their lane on bends, and are slower to respond to hazards. It is important to go ahead and deal with this issue for young adults now, so that they can break this habit and not have to deal with any future issues.

Due to the constant concern of this matter, many states have decided to enforce a hands free law. The different stats in the United States that have enforced this law are, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia plus Washington, D.C.

Laws and facts show several reasons why it is unsafe to text and drive, but when it narrows down, the driver must take under consideration the different situations that can affect them self and others in the vehicle as well. Younger drivers do not realize the importance of considering the passengers, other motorists, or pedestrians, there are so many things that can happen around a moving vehicle, and just the slightest move can have the worse outcome for everyone.

Although there are certain laws about the matter, most drivers either avoid the law or do not fully understand the importance of it. There are other ways to get through to someone about this matter, such as, telling someone about how uncomfortable it is, or how risky it can be, another way is just simply taking the phone from them.

In conclusion, driving while on a phone is something that should be strictly advised against, the next time someone gets in a vehicle and is preparing to drive away, they should think to themself about what could happen if they acknowledge the little device in their lap, think more responsibly and get to the destination safely.

"Hey, I'm just a regular 8th grader, so bear with me! 😅

Okay, so, electives. They're like, super important for high school students, you know? Like, they help us explore our interests and stuff. But, I mean, there's more to it than just that. Research shows that assigning electives can actually boost motivation, attendance, and grades. Like, whoa! 💥

First of all, let's talk about motivation. When we get to choose our own electives, it's like, super easy to lose interest. I mean, if I had to take, like, another math class, I'd totally zone out. But, if I get to choose from cool stuff like photography or drama, I'm way more likely to be motivated. It's like, I'm actually excited to learn something new! 🎉

And attendance, man. It's a real thing. When we're interested in what we're learning, we're way more likely to show up to class. Like, I know I'm more likely to skip math, but if I get to take a fun elective, I'll be there every day! 😅

And grades? Oh, man. Electives can seriously boost those too. When we're engaged in what we're learning, we do better in class. It's like, common sense, right? But, like, research shows that students who take electives tend to have higher GPAs than those who don't. 📚

But, like, there are some potential drawbacks to letting students choose their own classes. Some people might take classes that aren't challenging enough, or that don't really interest them. And, like, some teachers might not be as good at teaching certain subjects as others. So, it's important to find a balance. Maybe we could have a mix of required and elective classes, or something. 🤔

"Self-esteem is an individual’s opinion of themselves and their worth. It can be influenced by many different sources such as past experiences, family and society. Achievement is also a source of self-esteem. That is, achieving something – whether it be a personal goal or a major victory – can lead to a higher level of self-confidence. 

For example, a student who works diligently for a school project and earns a perfect score can gain a boost in their self-esteem. That student may then set larger goals for themselves in the future and feel more capable of meeting challenges. Alternatively, a worker who receives a promotion can feel proud of their success. This positive recognition of their achievement can boost their level of self-worth and lead to higher credibility when trying to achieve future goals. 

The process of achieving something can also be a source of self-esteem. Setting goals and objectives and pushing one’s self to achieve them can be a very rewarding experience in terms of self-confidence and self-worth. Achieving something also can involve rewarding yourself for successes. This could be in the form of celebratory treats or taking time for yourself to relax and enjoy the fruits of your hard work. Equally important is being able to recognize your successes, both big and small.

In conclusion, achievement is a great source of self-esteem for many people. Not only does achieving something lead to a higher level of self-confidence and recognition, but the process of committing to and achieving a goal is also a self-esteem booster. Knowing how to reward yourself after achieving something and setting goals appropriately so that they are achievable are also important strategies.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"The quote ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" suggests that problems are not something to be avoided, but rather something to be embraced as an opportunity to demonstrate our abilities and potential. This quote implies that problems are not inherently negative, but rather a chance to learn and grow.

Exhibiting this attitude in action can be incredibly beneficial in many different areas of life. In school, for example, students who approach problems with a positive attitude are more likely to be successful in their studies. They are more likely to seek help when they need it, and they are more likely to persist in the face of challenges. Similarly, in sports, athletes who view problems as opportunities to improve are more likely to achieve their goals. They are more likely to seek feedback from coaches and trainers, and they are more likely to work hard to overcome obstacles.

In personal life, this attitude can be particularly helpful in navigating difficult situations. When faced with a problem, individuals who approach it with a positive attitude are more likely to find solutions and move forward in a positive direction. They are more likely to learn from their mistakes and use that knowledge to make better decisions in the future.

Overall, the quote ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" applies to everyday life experiences in many different ways. By approaching problems with a positive attitude, individuals can learn from their mistakes and use that knowledge to improve their lives.

In conclusion, I agree with the quote ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" Problems are not something to be avoided, but rather something to be embraced as an opportunity to learn and grow. By exhibiting this attitude in action, individuals can be more successful in many different areas of life, including school, sports, and personal life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Pros and Cons of Attending School versus Traditional Distance Learning

As an 8th grader, I've been thinking a lot about the different ways students can learn. Some kids go to school every day, while others learn from home through distance learning. My parents are always talking about how they wish they could homeschool me, but I think I would miss out on too much if I didn't go to school. So, I decided to research the pros and cons of attending school versus traditional distance learning to see which one is better.

One of the biggest pros of attending school is that you get to hang out with your friends all day. I love seeing my friends every day and learning with them. It's way more fun than sitting at home alone. Plus, you get to play with toys and do fun activities in class, like science experiments or art projects. You also get to have recess and play games with your friends. That's way more fun than sitting at a desk all day.

Another pro of attending school is that you get to develop your social skills. When you're at school, you have to work with other kids and learn how to share and take turns. You also learn how to be a good friend and how to be in a group. These are really important skills that you need to know how to do when you grow up. If you don't learn them in school, you might have trouble making friends or working with others when you're older.

On the other hand, some people say that distance learning is better because you can learn at your own pace. If you're really good at math, you can move ahead and learn more challenging things. And if you're not good at math, you can take your time and practice until you get it right. Plus, you don't have to worry about getting bullied or feeling left out if you're shy.

But, I think distance learning is not as good as going to school. Even though you can learn at your own pace, you don't get to hang out with your friends or play with toys. And, you don't get to have recess or play games with",1,llama2_chat,1
"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:

Working in schools or at home: which is better?

I think that students should work in schools. I know some people say that working at home is better because you can work in your pajamas and eat snacks, but I think that's not true.

First of all, schools are better for social interactions. When you're at home, you're usually by yourself. You might see your family, but you're not really interacting with other people. In school, you get to see your friends and make new ones. You can play with them at recess and sit with them at lunch. You can also work with them on projects and share ideas. That's really important for your social skills.

Another reason why schools are better is that you can learn from other students. When you're at home, you're just learning from your parents or your teacher. But in school, you can learn from other students too. You can see how they solve problems and how they think. You can also ask them questions and get help from them. That's really helpful for your academic improvement.

Finally, schools are better for peer support. When you're at home, you don't have anyone to help you with your work. You might have your parents, but they might not understand the same things you do. In school, you have other students who can help you. They can explain things to you and give you ideas. You can also work together on projects and help each other out. That's really important for your academic success.

So, in conclusion, I think that students should work in schools. It's better for social interactions, academic improvement, and peer support. Sure, you might have to wear clothes and not eat snacks, but it's worth it. Plus, you can always eat snacks during recess!",1,llama2_chat,4
"Some schools require kids to do something school based over the summer, I don't agree with that at all. Kids use summer break as a vaction from all things school related. If they do make the kids do it then I think it should be student-designed. The reason being is, if you're going to take the students summer break then at least let them do what they want to do. If the things they choose to do is school-realatable than they should get to do it.

A summer break is a kids time to have fun. It's not meant for more things school, it mean that school needs to be as far as possible. Kids should be out playing with their friends, not stuck doing something school realated. Kids should never be forced to do something that they don't want to do. Me, personally I would never take a kids summer break away from them.

It shoud definently be student-designed. One, Adults don't know what us kids like to do. They are just going to merge all grades and expect all of us to get along. Kids should always have a say in what they are going to do. Some parents just make plans for their kids. That is not be the way kids should be treated.

But in my opinion, kids should never have their summer break taken. Also if you make the students do something over summer break than the teachers are going ot have to run it. Then that takes away from everybody, then everybody gets mad. Lastly, no one is going to run it. Which leaves the school in debt because their plan didn't go as planned.

In conclusion, No kids should not have their summer breaks taken away from them. Because kids use summer break as a time away fro school. But, if they do make the kids do this, then it should be kid-designed. If the teachers design it than it won't be as fun for the kids. ",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Come one, come all! Come join the Seagoing Cowboys program. After war, many citys and towns are left in ruins. Who will help the poor people who lost everything? I am glad you ask! You can help assist with helping animals cross safly to a new home. Come help out! The animals need your help to travle safly to and from the sea. It will all be worth it to see the smiles on the peoples faces! We could really use your help. The following shows all the important and awsome things you need to know about it.

One of the amazing pros of joining is you can help others. As Luke says,""It was an opportunity of a life time."" Helping people get back all the food supplies, animals, and more leaves a good feeling. It could make you more aware of people of other countries and their needs, like Luke.

The only complain that you might have is a few ingerys. Like when Luke cracked his ribs on one rainy night. You may get knocked over bord but that is very unlikly. All those times you helped people will surely make up for that. It could really be fun if you just try it. If you did not like your fist trip, you could always quit. At least you helped a few people out.

A few more exiting things woulg be the chance to sight see on your free time. Luke said,""Besides helping people, their is a benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, son was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy."" You may get the pleasure of seeing one, or both of those. Would that be awsome or what?

You can also have fun on the trip back. Like how Luke got to baseball and volleyball games after the animals got droped off. Table-tennis tornaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time of being at see. That way you are not bored out of your mind on the way back.

It can also be hard work to. You have to feed and water the animals two or three times a day. Sometimes you might have to take night watchman. That is were you have to get up every hour to check out the animals and report back to the captain. Just be careful or you might get hurt, like Luke did. Helping out with the animals can be fun, too. Even if it is exstrimly hard work.

Even if it is hard work you can still have fun. Sight seeing and the trip home is amazing. So come on! Join the Seagoing Cowboys program! It can be dangderous and hard, but in the end there are more great things to do than all the small dangers. Hard work is the price to pay if you do want to join. All the sights to see, helping people in tmes of needs, and the awsome trips will be fun!

So come join today! I am certain you will not regret it! Come help the cause. It will be an amazing experiance!",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Do you enjoy sports? Do you enjoy other activities outside of school? I think that students should be required to join at least one extracurricular activity because the student could potentially have a better time at finding a career, it may help them with academics, and it can give the student something to do.

One reason is that it would help students pursue a career that they may want in the future. Maybe a student would like to go for a career that school doesn't teach. An example would be a photographer. If the student enjoys sports, they could join a sports team to get better at it and know more on that sport. If the student wants to do a profession that includes music or instruments, then an extracurricular class could help them achieve that.

Another reason why an extracurricular class might assist a student is that it could help the students with education. If a student is having a hard time in class, they may want to join an academic activity so that it could help them. It would give the student a better working habit and help them strengthen their memory. They could also use the activity for studying for a quiz or test.

The final reason is that it would give the students something to do and they may find it enjoyable. The activity can range from sports, to an instrument, and to an academic activity. Many students go home and they don't have anything to do, so they could join an activity. Many people say that students should be able to choose what they would like to do, but I believe that at least one extracurricular class would help students a lot.

Therefore, students should join an extracurricular for educational help, gives the students something to do, and helps them with their career in the future. Extracurricular activities can benefit a child a lot. So I agree with my principle that all students must be in a extracurricular activity. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Phones and Driving

Have you ever called someone while they are driving? If you have then, do you care about that person's life? Because if so then you shouldn't do it or hang up the phone because that will put that person you are on the phone with is in danger. This makes the driver focus on the call or texting someone back instead of focusing on the road and other drivers that could run into them and hurt them. Do you know what texting and driving can do to your life? There are also ways to prevent texting and driving. And there are people this has effected a lot of people's lives.

Texting and driving is a major danger to your life. If someone is texting and driving and or talking on the phone that means they are not focused on the road or not focused on the other drivers that could possibly merge over and wreck the driver and possibly kill the person. This is a major problem because everyone has the urge to check their phone if they hear it go off with a text ding because everyone think that all calls are possibly an emergency but either that emergency or your life. There are many ways to prevent this.

You can prevent texting and driving many ways. One way to prevent texting and driving is to put your phone on silent or turn it off while driving in a vehicle. That will take the urge of texting someone back or answering a phone call until you get to your destination. If everyone done this when they got in the driver seat of a vehicle there would be less death my car because that is a hug percentage of the reason vehicular accidents happen behind drunk driving. And that effects people's life not just the person involved but the family.

This effect a lot of people's life when someone uses a cellphone when they drive because mostly every time they end up in a car wreck. This can affect the driver or passengers in the car because there are cases where people get paralyzed or brain damage or even worse die in car accidents. That can ruin the rest of their life plan. This can also ruin some families lives by having to care for you while you can't for yourself or sometimes the death case they must deal with you not being there the rest of their life. That's why people should not use cell phones while driving.

In my opinion Cell phones and driving is not ok. They can really ruin someone's life and people can also stop this by using some tips and not using it at all while driving. And this can hurt your life and anyone around you or that knows you. Please don't use a phone and drive I have people I care about on the roads and someone that uses a phone and drives can hurt them on the road and I love them and don't want something to happen to them because someone couldn't put down their phone.

"Schooling has been around for thousands of years, and, as the rest of society has evolved, the traditional schooling technique has virtually stayed the same. Children still remain at desks, listening to their teachers lecture; kids still take home worksheets for extra practice called ""homework."" Standardized tests are still given, and kids are still excelling. However, as time goes on, more people have begun to question this type of schooling, and why it has not changed for over 1000 years. A recent change people have suggested, with the rise of technology, is ""distance learning"", a way to ""attend"" school from the confines of ones own home. While this idea seems promising, it is not a good change for the schooling system because, for the vast majority of students, it will cause unneeded distractions, a less stimulating environment, and the inability to distinguish home and work life.

As children grow and learn, they are more likely to choose play over work. Because of this, kids are often distracted from their assignments in school, whether it be with the thoughts of their Buzz Lightyear action figure they can not wait to play with or with the drama on their cell phone. When children are placed in the sterile environment of the school system, these distractions are minimized because the child's surroundings are sterile, solely containing learning materials and peers who are trying to accomplish the same task. If a child were to attempt to learn at home, no matter what age they were, they would be surrounded with the temptations of play, and, even if they had the power to restrain, it would affect their ability to concentrate and retain information.

Continuing, the home simply does not stimulate the mind as completely as the school does. In a school there are hundreds of resources at a child's fingertips: libraries full of books, teachers full of knowledge, materials full of the ability to educate. While the home may have educational resources, the vast amount does not compare to that of a traditional school. Not only does a classroom have abundant learning materials and information, but it also has students who help each other grow and prosper in their learning environment. For hundreds of years, the traditional desk-and-chalkboard schooling system has been used, and over those years, people are still excelling and test scores are still rising. This is because the school stimulates the mind like nothing else; it allows children a place to let their curiosity wander and lead their education. To take away the school will take away the stimulation.

Finally, a common problem found in adults is an inability to separate home and work life; this begins at a young age when children fail to make the clear distinction between home and school. By allowing students to participate in school from their home, it will make this distinction even less clear which will not only affect the child's present life but also his or her future life as a working adult. when there is no specific time and place for a child to learn, their home and education lives blend together, often affecting both for the worse. An example of this is seen in Tara Westover, the famous author of the memoir,

Educated.

Westover was home schooled but was often given little time to learn because of her home obligations. This caused her to lack education as well as the knowledge that home and school are two distinctly different things. If students were able to mix their home and school lives, the negative results of an inability to distinguish The Home and The School would far outweigh the positives.

Many may disagree with this position, saying that this opportunity, to learn in the comfort of ones own home, would greatly benefit those who suffer from illness or other challenges that prevent them from attending school. However, the ratio of those who are unable to attend a traditional school to those who are is very small. Many students would take advantage of this ""distance learning"" opportunity and use it for an easier education rather than a better one. There are several types of accommodations one can receive for illness or any other obstacle that hinders their education; allowing any person, without such disabilities, to receive these accommodations endangers them and their education.

Although the idea of learning from home has been widely acknowledged, it has also been widely debated. There are several positives when one looks on the surface of this idea, however when one truly delves into the logistics of such a change, they will realize that there are too many negatives that accompany it. The home is too distracting and does not allow the proper stimulation for learning that a child needs to succeed in life; the lack of a distinguishable home and school life will also harm the child as he or she matures. If a change that is supposed to bring better and more accessible schooling to children in fact causes the opposite, this change will not benefit the education system. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"In recent years, schools have been grappling with the question of whether or not to allow the use of phones during school lunch. While some argue that it is necessary for students to stay connected with their families and friends, others believe that it is a distraction that takes away from the students' learning experience. In this essay, I will analyze the pros and cons of having a policy that allows the use of phones during school lunch versus a policy that doesn't allow the use of phones during school lunch.

On one hand, allowing the use of phones during school lunch can have several advantages. For one, it can help students stay connected with their loved ones. Many students have busy schedules and may not have the opportunity to speak with their families and friends during the school day. Allowing the use of phones during lunch can provide a brief respite from the academic rigor of the day and give students a chance to catch up with their loved ones.

Additionally, allowing the use of phones during school lunch can provide students with a sense of autonomy and control over their own learning experience. Many students are self-motivated and may use their phones to study or complete homework assignments during lunch. Allowing the use of phones during lunch can give these students the opportunity to take control of their own learning and make the most of their time.

On the other hand, there are also several disadvantages to allowing the use of phones during school lunch. One of the main concerns is that it can be a major distraction for students. Many students use their phones to play games, scroll through social media, or watch videos during lunch, which can take away from their ability to focus and learn during the rest of the school day. This can ultimately lead to lower academic performance and a decreased ability to learn.

Another disadvantage of allowing the use of phones during school lunch is that it can create a sense of unequal treatment for students. Some students may not have access to a phone or may not be able to afford one, which can create a sense of exclusion and unfairness for these students. This can also create a sense of pressure for students to have a phone, which can be financially burdensome for some families.

In conclusion, the decision to allow or not allow the use of phones during school lunch is a complex one. While there are certainly advantages to allowing the use of phones during lunch, there",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"I have been working with Nasa now for three years and not one have I heard some crazy things like this. How can people possibly think they are being reached out by aliens that is just so crazy I cant stress that enough. I think if aliens were real why would they want to be found if they are smart like people think they are because they can fly a spaceship then why would they leave that face there for us to find it.

If I was a alien I would not want to be found because who knows what they would do to me I would be so so frighten its not even funny. The other reason why I dont think it has anything to do with an alien is because where is that face from? Is it from an alien or human? How to we know if its even a face it can simply just be a rock that looks like face we do not know sure. For all we know this picture can actually be fake. They might just have wanted people to start thinking its a face and that we are living under aliens. I think my team in Nasa is just crazy straight up crazy.

So this is what I think about the whole alien thing this is not alien related stuff at all. It was never anything about alien stuff or egyption goddess stuff either its jusyt simply a rock that look like a face nothing more notrhig less.      ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear State Senator of Florida,

I believe that we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College has been a huge part of America since our founding fathers, who established this process. This process helps keep America in order in and in line. Where would our country be without it? We would be lost and confused with no direction to follow. The Electoral College helps keep America's voting process organized, which is key to a well functioning country. Which is why I believe that we should absolutley keep the Electoral College so that our voting process stays organized and because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning.

I believe we should keep the Electoral College because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning. Our founding fathers were the ones the establish the Electoral College which means it has been around since the beginning of our country. We should not change this tradition of America because it has seemed to kept us running smoothly for this long so why would we want to change that for no reason? If we stopped this tradition and changed it to all popular vote from citizens we would be hurting America in a huge way. It would completely change our ways of thinking, living, and running of America. Yes, a lot has changed in America since our founding fathers and yes change is sometimes for the better in our country because things are obviously different now then what they were 200 years ago but change would not be for the better in this situation. Let's say your grandmother, Mr. Senator, has had a peach cobbler recipe in your family for ages and it just takes your breath away with all the flavor and its divine taste, but this recipe is very old. If your grandmother's old recipe taste so delicious you would not want to change one thing about that recipe. Well same with the Electoral College. Its extremely old but it has also kept our country running well and has not failed us yet so we should not change this process just like you would not want to change your grandmothers peach cobbler recipe. This is why I think we should keep the Electoral College because it has kept us going since the beginning and you do not change something just because it is old or thought of being outdated.

Voting for someone to be the head and leader of an organization is an extremely big deal, especially when that organization is a country with laws, citizens, and many other important topics. America needs to have a president willing to stand up for what is right, be there for his people, and run America in a smooth and organized fashion. If the elections were based upon popular vote then imagine what could happen, someone running for president could act like a person who is willing to take on the huge responsibility and stand up for what is right, but when everyone votes for him and they get into office then they turn into a total coward and someone not determined enough to take on the responsibility or take on America. With Electoral College those running for president are also being voted on by Congress and qualified citizens. This makes things run much more smoothly because citizens are still getting to put there two cents in but only if they are qualified which is much more reasonable. Citizens are a huge part of America, they have a lot to do with America running smoothly or not, which is why they should have a say in who runs their country, but no so much of a say that its unorganized and completely on their own opinion. I mean lets face it, us citizens have our flaws and dont always make the best decisions or have the best opinions. Having qualified citizens voting and Congress members voting make it much more understandable. Most Congress members will have been in Office for a very long time which makes them wiser and better to understand the whole voting process, the way America runs, and laws. Most will be able to pick out the better qualities for president out of each of the members running for president. This is why I belive we should keep the Electoral College because it keeps voting organized.

The Electoral College is what keeps our voting process in order. When something gets old you do not throw it away if it still is of good use for you and the Electoral College is definetly still in good shape and is doing our country well so we should not change it because it has kept our country functioning from the beginning and so our voting process stays organized.

Sincerely, a fan of the Electoral College    ",0,persuade_corpus,4

The article says there is a lot of war like things involved as well. It gets pretty dirty and rough to be a seagoing cowboy. I would suggest doing because it gives you oppertunities, and soemtimes it can be fun. You can't be weak and not willing to do work though. There is a lot of training to go through and it is not easy. So if your a hard working worker this is the place for you to be.

Then there are some severe injuries or even worse. You got to be tough though. I have a good time though. Beside the work, but sometimes it can be fun. You have company as well to cheer you up when your down. Some work you have to do is cleaning, feeding the animals, or even pulling or pushing heavy objects. Like in the article it said the animals have to be fed or watered two or three times a day.

Yet all the work there is fun. Like seeing all of the awesome landscapes or cities. If you feel down this will bring you up. Watching the sun set. Being with workers that are kind. There is more and more. It is just what kind of person you are. If you are a hard worker and like to see cool things. This is the place for you.

"The idea of driverless cars sounds so futuristic, but I wouldn't trust one. Something can go wrong with the car and there wouldn't be anyone to blame. Not that I'm looking for someone to blame, but someone could get injured or hurt very badly just because a car stopped working. A lot of people been in car accidents before, now imagine how bad it would be if the cars drove themselves! It would be nice to not have to drive and get drove to, but how can you TRUST a car?

An accident can happen using the driverless car and what would happen? The passengers can't be blamed, the car can't, and neither can the manufactors. A lot of technology has stopped working or can get broken and a lot of stuff can happen with one simple mistake. Now imagine that there would only be driverless cars, how ridiculous does that sound! How are the cars even going to know the laws?

Most people would say the car would have a computer that would know the laws. There's always new laws and how would the computer know the new ones? What if the computer gets the laws mixed up? A computer can stop working and you might not even know it! If a person mixes up the laws they can get a ticket or even get sent to court for not knowing them. It could keep the roads safer. The car messes up and what would happen? The car gets taken away? It goes to get fixed?

Most driverless cars that we have now, still need a driver. How pointless does that sound? Might as well just drive it yourself. Texting and driving is a big issue in the 21st century, people will think they can now text with the driverless car and won't even notice what's happening on the road. Driverless cars aren't going to make the world better and neither will they stop accidents from happening. Once a driverless car gets into an accident, no one will want one. I'm pretty sure it will happen someday and it would then be pointless to keep manufactoring them.

Driverless cars are just too much. It's like paying for a computer to drive you. You can't trust one! They might crash, break, and even do something you didn't tell it to do. Not everyone might agree with me, but I know for sure that no one would buy one after an accident happens. Please don't risk your life by buying a driverless car.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"When it comes to advice it's always good to have more than one persons opinion. Everyone thinks differently and have different perspectives with different things. Some people may agree with you and others may not which it's always good to see who agrees with you and who doesn't. It can always help you out with what you want to do and what you don't want or shouldn't do.

Many people look at things differently so you're obviously not going to agree on everything with the person. But when it comes to advice it can get difficult on who you should agree with. For example lets say you want to set a goal for yourself like wanting to lose weight. You may think just by not eating any junk food and start eating healthier would solve the problem don't get me wrong it may help, but lets say you're not too sure so you ask a friend for advice. In that case it's good to ask more than one person to see what you want to do which should always be something you think is best for you.

Don't stress about other peoples opinions if they disagree with you and you know that it's something you want to do and look forward on doing go ahead and go for it. You shouldn't do something that doesn't make you happy do something you enjoy, something that make you feel good about yourself because at the end of the day it's not always about what people think if not what you enjoy doing and feel good about.

You basically get the point on what I am trying to say is yes it's good asking for advice but don't be that type of person who ask for advice and never ends up doing it. Yeah I understand if it's something you're not interstead in doing but if it's more than one person who you asked advice for and never end up doing anything. Then what was the whole point on asking for advice if you weren't going to do anything.

Just do something you enjoy and like I said everyone may have agreements and disagreements but do something which you know is the best for you and not something you feel obligated to do if not what makes you feel good about yourself doing.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggetst that studing Venus is worthy but also dangerous. The author tells us how Venus is ""one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"" and also the second largest plantet with the ""nickname misleading since Venus is actually a planet"". There so many things to learn about when it comes to different planets. It would be worthy to go study more things about plantets so we can know about them and maybe one day lots of people coud go on one of these plants without just being a scientist. The bad thing about is we still don't have the best ways to get there and back saflty.

There is 97 percent of carbon dioxide in Venus and plus more of a challeng is the clouds of highy corrosive and eve 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It makes it a little hard to be able to go on Venus because of all that. ""NASA is working on other approaches to studiying Venus. For example, osme simplified eletronice made of silicaon carbid have been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus's surface.

stiving ot meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only becasse of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidation endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded ot meet the very badges of imaination and innovation.",0,persuade_corpus,0

"Dear Principal

It is true that some students have a C average, but these students are great at the sport they are playing. They may become somebody when they get older. School comes first, but at the same time the coach needs that student to perform and do his/her best at that sport. The team may need that student for a game or so to win the District Championship for the school and hang a banner up. So if a student has a C average then let that student play that special game and he or she will make up all the bad grades they have made. Games are important for a kid if there in school because it may be the last game they play ever, but they wont know it unless they play school sports and at school sports may help you with what you may want to do when you get older in life. Students like reputation, so to get that they need to play sports in school to get noticed by any professional sports team. This may be there dream in life and may be something they want to do if they don't want to have a job. More likely the kids will get a job, but just let these kids play there sport and they will do anything to pay you back in return. If they get older and play for a special team they might say your name when they get drafted by a team and just because of you when you let them play that game they will respect and care for you at all times because you helped them get somewhere in the big world. If you give them a opportunity to achieve something they might do the same thing for you. You never know how kids can be when they get in the real world.

"There students that would be able to benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because there schools that can let you take online classes. You are able to work on your own pace,you are also able to balance school,work and spending time with friends and families,and your able to take video conferencing at home.

There are many different schools that can let you take online classes. There students going through family issues at home that they aren't able to attend school regularly. It can help them to learn in class so they don't fall behind or fail the grade. They just want to learn like us and have a great future. It can also help if you are attending collage but not want to stay on campus.

When having the benefit to take online class at home is working at your own pace. You are working at your own pace to get in done fast or you just like to take your time. Many students prefer taking their time becasue it will help them understand it more then rushing the working knowing that it could be wrong. It can also help them be more then the other colleagues at school. When having this opportunity your able to get work done without any distractions.

When balacing school,working and spending time with family and friends can be very diffcult at times if you are attending school regularly but when taking online classes it can help you understand the class more and you can focus more then getting distracted at school because of friends. This will help you get the work done in matter of seconds.

When having the intrenet your able to do may things but having the opportunity to a video conference from home while still attending school is the best. This will help you with one on one tutoring sessions to ask questions to your teacher or professor when having trouble with anything in a subject. You are also able to learn new things while doing video conference.

Students should take this opportunity to attend school from home because instead of going to school for seven to eight hours, you can learn everything at home without anyone rushing you or having a deadline when its due. Its better to take your time and take the opportunity. I would recommed this to anyone who would rather get to learn at home on their own.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Hey there!  So, you know how they say you only get one chance to make a first impression?  Yeah, it's totally true.  Making a good first impression is super important, like, really important. 

Think about it, when you meet someone new, you're basically judged based on how you come across in that first moment.  Like, if you're messy and disorganized, people might think you're not really put together or responsible.  And if you're super awkward or shy, they might think you're weird or unfriendly. 

But here's the thing, having a good first impression can make a huge difference in how people treat you.  Like, if you come across as confident and friendly, people are more likely to be nice to you and want to hang out with you.  On the other hand, if you come across as awkward or unfriendly, people might avoid you or treat you poorly. 

I know this from personal experience.  Like, there's this one time when I was new in class and I accidentally knocked over my pencil case and spilled stuff all over the floor.  And my teacher was like, totally annoyed with me.  But then, after I cleaned up the mess and apologized, she started treating me better and we even became friends. 

So yeah, patience is super important when meeting someone for the first time.  Like, don't be too quick to judge yourself or others.  Just take your time, be friendly and respectful, and things will usually work out okay. 

In conclusion, making a good first impression is super important and can have a big impact on how people treat you.  So, just be patient, be kind, and always try to make a good impression.  That's my two cents, anyway.",1,llama2_chat,4
"Through the past century, mechanization on a global scale has indubitably innovated the world in efficency and economic progress. In particular, however, the key invention of the car has solely shown the benefits of such techonological progress. For a few innovators, the mere invention of cars did not seem convincing enough, hence the creation of driverless automobiles has been in design to furtherly increase efficiency and safety. Although the benefits of adopting driverless cars in society seem convincing in progressing society, ultimately, the implementation of driverless cars will only entail disaster.

A strong factor contributing to the cons of driverless cars is the undeniable usage of human skills throughout the road even with using driverless cars. Although the term ""driverless car"" may seem like a straight-forward terminology, it is in reality not. Currently, there is no such development of a car that completely remains independent of the car passenger. On paragraph 7 it notes, ""None of the cars developed so far are completey driverless."" Morever, due to the fact that driverless cars cannot function completely by themselves, this requires that human passengers still have to be attentive at all times.

As continued on paragraph 7 it states, "" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" In summation, this means the human driver must continue to remain alert and be ready to take over the wheel if the driverless car cannot deal with a specific situation. Despite that driverless cars can permform tasks independently, it is only to a limited extent. Therefore, this still requires the full attention and driving skill set of the car driver. If this still requires the full attention and driving skills of the car driver, the invention of the carless driver, in reality, has no useful benefits. The driver therefore, still has risks of getting into car accidents because they still need to rely on their driving abilities, rendering the invention of driverless cars ineffective.

The most important factor of all in contributing against the promotion of driverless cars however, is the idea of fault. On paragraph 9, a controversial question is brought up, asking ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" If a driverless car were to get into an accident and if someone were to be injured as a result, who's fault would it ultimately be? This serious and controversial argument as a result, creates a prodigious amount of conflict, particularly between drivers and manufacturers. Because driverless cars are most of the time, indepent of the car drivers, an accident caused by this invention will guaranteed cause a difficulty in finding who is truly at fault. On one hand, it could have been the driver himself for not paying attention to the road and altering the mechanics of the driverless car. However on the other hand, it could have been a completely honest mistake, where the driverless car itself commited an automated mistake that did not associate with the actions of the car driver.

Driverless cars in conclusion, make it difficult to assert the blame on whos truly at fault in a driverless car accident, therefore making it extremely more difficult in handling and resolving this situation.

Without driverless cars, there will only be one to blame and therefore, more problems will be resolved.

Lastly, the existence of traffic laws and working zones on the roads is prominent in abasing the efficency of driverless cars. On paragraph 9 it says, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" In other terms, common aspects of the road, such as traffic laws and working zones, are designed so that only human drivers can handle those situations, thus making driverless cars useless. In these terms, this means that alert drivers will perform much more reliably than an automated car because the road and traffic laws are set up so that the only safe car is a car where a human driver is in control at all times. Because driverless cars are incapable of handling such pivotal features of the modern road system, they must still rely on their human drivers, contradicting their own title of ""driverless"" cars. In conclusion, because the driving laws of the road are mainly designed so that safety will be best achieved with alert human drivers, the implementation of driverless cars in modern society is utterly useless.

Due to the manifestations of human action-based driving laws, continued necessity for human driving skills, and no exact blame for fault in a driverless car accident, the addition of driverless cars into society will only bring increased harm and debatable increased efficiency.

The addition of fully driverless cars is currently only fantasy, and should remain this way eternally.                         ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"This system could be very benificial in classrooms for many reasons. One reason being this system can literally tell what all of your emotions are an what percent each of them are. How a student feel about school or a class can effect how they do in school or the class big time. If a student hates the class and dreads going there every single day then that will effect how they do in the class and usaully for the worse, this does not mean they will fail the class but alot of the time there grade will not be as good as it should be. If a student loves the class and loves going to school then obviously they will be more ingaged and do better in the class most of the time.

Schools could use this system to see what they could change in the school to make kids enjoy class and school more. Them doing this would hopefully improve grades and attitudes toward school which could always lead to more students wanting to go to college. There are alot of long term very benifical plans that could come with this.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"In my opinion, I think students should design their own summer projects. To start off, If you, a student have an assignment that doesn't interest you at all, it would make a huge difference if you could make it on something that interests you. Furthermore it is also summer so it would be fitting to give the students a bit of freedom and let them make a project that they'll have fun with. The last thing a student would want on summer break is to be stuck with a stressful or boring project.

Another reason why I think students should choose their own projects is because they could make it on what they are doing over their summer break, for example if a student is at a beach in a different country they can make it on the different types of wild life that live there. Which would make it far more easier for the student to do since it would be about them and what they are doing over break. In addition to this students won't have to stress over doing research on it since it's about what they're doing. But if they do happen to do some research it would be on what the student is interested in. And because the student can choose their own project the options are endless since it could be on pretty much anything.

In addition to my previous statement, because students will have the option to choose on what their project will be on, and not some boring project the teachers will hand out. More students will be inclined to do their projects and turn them in and on time. studies have also shown teens are 80% more likely to get things done when it's something they actually care and are interested about. With students choosing their own projects teachers will receive quality projects and the students will start off the year with a good grade to go with it.

Finally, with students choosing their projects they will have more options on what to do and how they want to do them. this will also make the required summer project much easier for students because it will be around what they are interested in and enjoy. And is way better than having to do a stressful project that a teacher can give out on a topic that students could care less about. Also giving students the chance to choose their own project will let them show how creative they are with it and how much more effort will be put into it. These are my reasons on why summer projects should be student designed.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Students would have more benefits taking online classes from home than going to school that is far away from where they are. Online classes would have huge impact in students lives which is going to solve many problems. I think students would have the benefits to take online classes from home instead of going to a far school which is causing them to wake up early to catch up the bus, waste time, spend money and stress. This can be change if students are allowed to take online classes from home.

Students would have more benefits taking online classes from home than going to school, one of the main reason I said this is because of waking up early. For example, my daily life is waking up early to go to my bus stop because from my house is 30 minutes away and I have to walk where is dark outside like around 6:00am. Any student that walks in the morning in the darkest there is some chances to get in risk because bad people are outside to harm innocent people. My mom is always concern that I have to wake up early and walk in the darkest, she tries to change her work schedule more later but she can't but she always call me to make sure I get safe to my bus stop. I think this is one of the reason online classes can benefits students by protecting them.

Online classes from home would help students and their family to have time management. Sometimes students have to go to a doctor appointment which cause their parents to get out of work and go all the way to school and then go to the doctor with a lot of rushed because time goes fast. For example, in my personal experience sometimes I have a doctor appointment which cause my mom to pick me up from school and then go to the doctor but after that she has to pick up my siblings from the babysitter which is going to get her tired from driving too much and also wasting time which shouldn't been different if I had the chance to stay at home and do online classes, my mom and I wouldn't have to rushed to go to doctor appointment and cook for the family. My mom works everydays at 4:00am and she has to take my siblings to the babysitter to early even when is freezing. I will like to help her taking care of my siblings by taking online classes from home instead of going to school, therefore my mom and I would have use the time wisely.

Online classes for students will benefits their family economy. Instead of buying a lot of supplies and clothes to go to school would prevent them to spend too much money. One example related to my life is when schools are about to open and my mom has to save money to buy me supplies and clothes to go to school which would cause her to work more and save. Also in our society some families have problems with their economy which would be difficult for them to buy their kids supplies and clothes which would cause them to sell items from their houses. If online classes are provided to students it would benefits students family including mine because my mom is not going to waste money on babysitting,gas,clothes and supplies as usual.

Online classes for students will benefits their health of not stressing anymore. Some students stress a lot about what clothes they have to wear to school which is going to cause them to over think a lot. Stress is really serious problem because students feel stresses out when they go to school because of not having time management or not having enough sleep. Online classes will prevent students to get bullied in school. Stress is a really common symptoms between students and should be preventable for the safe of our students. For example, when I have to wake up early I stress a lot because I have to get ready fast and walk to my bus stop and sometimes I skipped breakfast because I study when I get to school. If they provided me online classes I will have stress but not that much as I usually did in school because I will have more time to sleep and eat breakfast which would help me stay mentally healthy.

I think students would have the benefits to take online classes from home instead of going to a far school which is causing them to wake up early to catch up the bus, waste time, spend money and stress. Students would have time to spend time with their family and communicated more to each other often and informed their parents about their problems. Online classes would impact our lives in a positive way to help students stay home safe, have time management, have a stable economy and less stress for the good of our lives.          ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"As the demand rises for higher level courses, teachers have formatted a new tool to prepare their students for the rigorous year to come: summer assignments. These projects can lay important groundwork for a course, or simply act as filling during the summer months. The distinction between the two is dependent on the experience of its creator and how much care is put into the creation of the assignment. Therefore, teachers should be entrusted with the duty of preparing summer projects for their students.

One of the crucial factors in this decision is how much of a higher quality of work a teacher can bring to the situation. As certified instructors, they know the intricacies of the course and what a student needs for a strong foundation for the year. Educators know from experience what information is needed to succeed, from the classroom to summer break. A student that has never taken the course would have little way of knowing what is important to delve into. Secondly, teachers have both education and real life experience in planning projects. They can utilize their college educations and invaluable prior years as a teacher in ways an inexperienced student cannot when it comes to creating an assignment from nothing. Enlisting a licensed, qualified educator would be much more advantageous then putting the responsibility in the hands of a student.

On the other hand, many students believe that they should be the ones directing their own home education. While the idea has some validity to it, it should not apply to situations akin to summer projects. When you take a course, there is a certain amount of responsibility placed on the instructor to do their part in teaching. Putting this responsibility on students would not be too different from asking them to create their own homework. In order to expect students to succeed, teachers must invest time into guiding their education. Also, an influential part of the effect of summer break assignments is the power it has to open new perspectives. The projects with the most impact leave one looking at the subject from a new point of view. If a student was to plan their own learning experience, they would not be able distance themselves from what they already know enough to create as much of a difference. Finally, a project needs strong guidelines to lead the student through the possibilities towards the information they started out for. Leaving the structure open for students to construct allows them to easily lose the purpose of the assignment and complete a project entirely different from the requirements of the teacher. This gaping hole in the process leaves students with poor grades on the project and without the head start needed for the class. Keeping instruction in the hands of those more qualified would better impact the students and set them up for success in the coming year.

In closing, allowing teachers to mandate summer projects would produce the best results in the students' learning. While allowing students to become more involved in their education through making their own decisions is important, it would not properly support them in the years to come. The experience and indispensable guidance of a qualified teacher in the creation of the assignment is imperative to the students' success. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Ummm... hey there!  So, like, I guess I'm gonna write this essay about the disadvantages of being in a world where people try to force you to conform. 

Okay, so, like, let's face it. Conformity can be, like, super annoying.  When everyone around you is trying to act the same, dress the same, and think the same, it's like, totally stifles creativity and individuality.  I mean, who wants to be just another face in the crowd, right? 

First of all, when people try to force you to conform, it's like, super limiting.  You can't express yourself freely, because you don't want to be seen as different or stand out.  And that's, like, totally not cool.  I mean, why can't we just be ourselves and not have to worry about what others think? 

And it's not just that, but when everyone's trying to conform, it's like, super hard to make new friends.  Like, if you're the only one who's not into the ""cool"" thing, it's hard to find people who actually get you.  And that's, like, super lonely. 

Also, when people try to force you to conform, it can, like, totally stifle your creativity.  When you're not allowed to express yourself, you can't come up with new ideas or think outside the box.  And that's, like, super important for, like, art and stuff. 

And lastly, when everyone's trying to conform, it's like, super hard to have, like, real conversations.  When everyone's saying the same things and dressing the same, there's no depth to their conversations.  It's like, they're not really connecting or anything.",1,llama2_chat,4

""My name is Luke, Luke Bomberger. The Seagoing program was a opportunity of a lifetime for me. Yes, there were many struggles and hardships but I got through it. You should really join the program it gives you something new to try in life. Also, it helps recover food supplies, animals, and much more for the 44 nations who joined together to make the UNRRA.

There are amazing places you can go to. For intance, we took a trip to Greece. The Acropolis there was something special. In this program there is never a dull moment. You're either taking care of the animals, sight-seeing, being at night watchman. There is also times to have fun. The othercowboys and I have time to play games or do on board such as baseball, volleyball, table-tebbis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, or other games to pass the time.

Since there are struggles to this job I might as well say them too. This job is much more than a adventure, it shows you unbelievable things in this world. My aunt Katie helped me prepare for this. She might not have known it but she did.

The thing is though that I was never prepared of the dangers at sea. It was only my second trip and I served as a night watchman. That night I was to check on the animals every hour and to report to the captain. It was a very rainy night. After I had made my hourly report to him I was sliding down on my backside a slippery ladder. My heart was pounding I was slidding feet first toward an opening on the side of our ship. Luckly a thin strip of metal on the edge of the ship saved me from going to the dark Atlantic ocean. I was very happy that I was alive but I could not work for a few days or so because i cracked my ribs.

There are advantages and challenges apart of this job. Some challenges may be risky but if you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you are doing this for a good cause.

"In modern society people tend to be scared to voice their opinions, espescially students. With pressure of teachers, deans, and other peers most students would rather keep their hand down if something they disliked arises. If schools incorperated this software, invented by professor Huang and Sebe, then schools would get immediate feedback on how students felt about classes, teachers, homework, and school as a whole.

Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe have worked together to invent a software that is one of a kind. This software constructs a 3-D computer model of a face, and calculates the movement of 44 major muscles in the model to determine their emotion. If this solftware could somehow be applied to school computers and labtops the results would be amazing. A school board would know if students enjoyed school computers, or enjoyed a new software they were trying out. Teachers could understand if students were getting the current lesson. These are all examples of topics that students feel pressured to speak out on, and without them speaking one word a teacher or school board would understand how they felt about it.

Being able to detect the emotions of students could enhance the school experience by a jurastic difference.

"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" did a fair job at arguing their claim, that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author used their thesis, counter-arguements, and rebutals to get across their point that Venus is a worthwhile investment to study. Some areas they exceeded and others they did not hit right on the ball.

The author throughout the essay did not convey a very well stated thesis. Typically, a writer of an arguementative essay would feature their thesis openly, so that the reader is able to see what side the author is pushing forward. However, this author did not do this. The first paragraph introduces the topic of Venus with an interesting hook, but does not give the reader their side. The reader needs a thesis, without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed. The author's current attempt at a thesis statement , ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely,"" does not state what side they are on clearly. Their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph. The author wrote, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This is a very strongly worded thesis, but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph. Their side on the topic was acknowledged, but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly.

Beyond the thesis, the author used many counter-arguements in their writing. This is one of their strong suits, acknowledging both sides of an arguement is one of the best ways to convey your opinion affectively, while still being able to keep opposing side of the arguement interested and have their minds open to change. The author is for the exploration of Venus, but consistently chooses to bring up the problems that doing so faces. The author writes about the difficulties about exploring Venus, because of the planet's extreme environment. They opposed their own side in paragraph three by saying, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This is an affective strategy, because people who may oppose exploration to Venus may say something similar to this. The author is arguing their own point to establish reliability and trust amongst with people who favor not exploring Venus. The author showing that they see the problems with exploring Venus shows that they are open minded and open to their mind being changed, and this will in turn have the reader do the same.

Furthermore, the author was able to affectively state rebutals and reinforce their own opinion with facts. From the example stated earlier, regaurding the extreme conditions in Venus, the author was able to provide a logical solution to the weather without using any opinions. The author wrote,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow sceintists to float above the fray."" The author then goes onto describe NASA's plan in full depth, and going into fine detail about the floating contraption that would suspend the astronauts safely above the harsh atmosphere of Venus. They then state, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author is displaying a solution for the conditions, and even the minor flaws it has. The author going into detail about the solution for the extreme conditions in Venus and even conceding a bit when saying, ""Not easy conditions but survivable for humans,"" helps argue their point. They affectively refuted the counter-arguements by using factual evidence in their rebutal, and deemed themselves trustworthy by the opposing side by even conceding slightly on a few issues.

The author of ""The Callenge of Exploring Venus"" did a fair job when arguing that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. While the author did accurately present the dangers and solutions for the dangerous parts of exploring Venus, they failed to create a strong thesis. The author exceeded when giving factual information about the topic to help the reading get on their side of the arguement; do to them struggling to get across their position on if Venus exploration is worthwhile, some of the provided information they gave was not used to it's full potential when changing the reader's opinion.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Hey there!  So, I've been tasked with researching and comparing the benefits of distance learning versus traditional classroom learning. As an 8th grader, I'm like, super excited to dive into this topic and see which one comes out on top! 🤔

First off, let's talk about distance learning.  It's like, where you don't actually go to school in a classroom, but instead, you learn from home or wherever you want!  Like, you can watch videos, listen to lectures, and even take quizzes and tests online! It's like, super convenient, right? 😍

But, you know what's even better? Traditional classroom learning!  It's like, where you actually go to school with your friends and a teacher, and you get to learn stuff in a more hands-on way!  Like, you can ask questions, participate in discussions, and even get help from your teacher if you need it! 🤓

Now, here's where it gets interesting!  Some students might benefit more from distance learning, like those who have busy schedules or who live far away from school!  Like, imagine if you had a super important sports game or a family vacation planned, but you still wanted to keep learning!  With distance learning, you can do that! 🏈🏖️

On the other hand, some students might prefer traditional classroom learning!  Like, if you're the type of person who learns better with face-to-face interaction and hands-on activities, then traditional classroom learning might be the way to go!  Plus, you get to hang out with your friends and have a more structured learning environment! 🤝

So, there you have it!  Both distance learning and traditional classroom learning have their pros and cons, and different students might benefit from one or the other!  It's like, totally up to you to decide which one works best for you! 😃",1,llama2_chat,2
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Many kids and parents thing that you should not allow students to have phones at school at all because of our grades. But to be honest I think you should pick Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. The reason why I think that you should pick police number one is because there are some times when teachers don't let us go to the office to use the phone and teacher are not allow to let students use the phone in the class. Some times we feel so bad and we ask for permission to go to the nurse and teacher don't allow us go or if we go to the nurse they don't do nothing to make us feel better. Another reason why I think you should pick police number 1 is because what about if there is on accident in our families how are we gonna be able to know. I know that our parents can call the office to let us know but I think we should still have our cell phones with us. When our parents don't know if they are gonna be able to know if they are gonna come and pick us up from school, how are we gonna be able to know. If you let us have our cell phone in school we promise you that we are not going to use our cell phones during class time. We are not gonna bring our grades down. Well TEACHER_NAME this are my reasons why I think you should pick Police number 1.      ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Having a car that will drive on its own is cool and all, but when you think about it it could be very dangerous. People in todays society are very lazy. All most people do now in days is sit at home, sleep, eat, or watch televison. So I dont think having a driverless car is such a good idea.

See people today get used to things quick without really noticing that they are used to it. For example television, its a great invention but people over use it. Some people make television their top priority. People even use television as an excuse. It stops them from making interactions with the real world, because people have grown to be lazy.

Another example is a cellphone. Everywhere you go everyone has a type of cellphone, wether it's a smartphone or a flip phone. People are so drawn to their phones especially teenagers. Everyone is on some type of social media sight, wheter it's facebook, instagram, snapchat, etc. Again everyone is making technology their top priority.

Having a car that can drive itself isn't really a good idea. We as humans get lazy over just little things, so imagine having a driverless car. What if someone in the driverless car falls asleep? In the passage it says this ""driverless car"" isn't so accurate. Meaning it can't drive itself completely. The driver still has to be alret of whats going on. So knowing us as humans and how we are why would anyone want to make a driverless car.

I honestly believe this car will be dangerous. SOmeone could fall asleep from getting too comfortable, again us being humans and getting used to things, causing the driver to possibly get into a car accident not only risking themselves but other pedestrians.

I am not in anyway shape or form trying to say technology is bad, but if it isnt used correctly it can be a dangerous thing. I beleive only people who are responsible and mature and know right from wrong are the ones who caan handle this type of technology. These ""driverless cars"" are not for everybody.

Community service is a very good plan , community services need more reliable citizens to depend on . Community service doesn't actually have to be just cleaning up litter , community service can be helped in many ways , Such as Cleaning up Beaches , streets/parks , or helping at an after school program . Community service is a very good idea .

Some Beaches are usually filled with Dirty Garbage that people leave behind when there on their vacations . At beaches you see bear bottles , can's of soda's , plates , and even wrappers that can affect our environment and animals . Streets are full with things that people throw out of their cars even if its against the law . Littering our streets can be a big conflict to our drivers , anything can happen to the wheels while there driving . Parks can be a fun place for kids to spend their time but also there dirty with candy wrappers , ice cream wrappers all these sort of things should be improved to help in our community .

Middle School teenagers are more active , and have more time then these adults . Most teenagers do not work , these teenagers have time to spend on helping our community . Some of my friends think that Community service is a waste of time , that they have better things to do then just pick up garbage , i used to think that i picked up enough garbage at home . But when i realized and asked about community service , my room is nothing compared to the garbage out there in just one street block . It's their decision to perform community service if they want to or not .

Helping in an after school program can be very fun for teenagers . They can get to show kids and give them a heads up on what high school is like . teenagers can volunteer to help students after school on their homework , problems and for the best part they can also at the same time get their High-school hours . Kids will have fun play and learn things everyday from these Community programs .

These are some of hundreds of ways that teenagers can be part of Community services , they can ask questions or find put more by searching what community service is like .It can make a Big change in their lives .

"Professional soccer in the late 1800s required immense skill and hard work to achieve success. Players worked tirelessly perfecting their techniques and detail-oriented skills while simultaneously developing their endurance. Communication was also imperative to the success of the game during this period. The ability to effectively communicate planned plays and strategize with teammates could make or break a team.

To demonstrate the significance of both talent and effort, I'd like to use the example of a fictional soccer player, Alex Hunter. Alex was a naturally talented player, possessing the skills necessary to lead his team. Although he was gifted in the game, his drive and determination allowed him to work just as hard as his teammates. Thanks to the combination of his natural talents and hardworking attitude, Alex and his teammates achieved success on the field.

In conclusion, both talent and hard work are essential for success in professional soccer, as evidenced by the role communication plays in the game and the example of Alex Hunter's combination of skill and dedication. Without communication, trust in team dynamics is lost, as is the opportunity for success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Schools often offer distance learning as an option for students for example homeschooling, do you believe these type of classes would benefit a child or not? In my opinion I believe this could effect children in many ways, but I believe theres more negative effects then their is good so I believe it wouldn't benefit a child. Some negative effects could for example be children not being able to really make friends and a children's mental health or emotional feelings being effected by these type of classes. Some children do want to be home schooled though, in fact many kids do and one of the biggest reasons of that happening is children getting picked on. Many things lead a parent to choose home school or online classes for their child but I believe this isn't the best idea.

My first reason that leads me to believe a child being home schooled or taking online classes wouldn't really benefit them is because it's hard for kids to make friends this way especially if they began taking these classes at a very young age. What led me to believe this is the fact that when a student is being home schooled their isn't really anybody else to interact with for example another student to speak to. Most of the time it's just a child and a teacher and since they wouldn't really get a chance to be exposed to other people how could they possibly build friendships. A child wouldn't really have a way to friend someone unless it was in a public place like a mall which would be much harder for a student to do because many people are shy. I believe if a child was going to a public school or even private school this wouldn't be an issue at all for the student because they would have plenty of people they could talk to and become friends with, it would make it much easier for the child.

A different type of effect this could have on a child that would be negative as well is, a childs mental health or emotional feelings getting effected by being home schooled. A student who is being home school doesn't really get a chance to interact with many people other then their teacher or their family. When something like this happens it tends to lead a person to feel lonely and could strongly upset them at times. It would be hard for them to go out to a public area as well it could possibly give them anxiety to do so, for example if a students mom takes them somewhere public it could make the child feel uncomfterable because they aren't really used to being around many people since they only interact with their family and teacher. I think distance learning would make a students daily life much harder then it would be if they would go to a school with other students, if a child went to a school where they could interact with other people this wouldn't be an issue kids would be able to speak to other students and not feel uncomfterable going out to a public location.

In many cases parents don't really have a choice though, their best option is to choose home school for their children's own good. In many cases students get picked on at their school which could lead to a child being depressed. In fact in many schools bullying is a big issue probably the biggest issue in public or private schools it happens all over the world. When a child is being bullied it makes them not even want to step foot into a school with other students because its gotten that bad for them. When this happens a child misses a lot of school because they are scared to return and their best option is being home schooled. Home schooling often works for children who are being bullied and makes them feel much more comfterable and safer in this type of environment. In this type of case it is best for a child to do what they feel more comfterable doing because if they continue going to a school where they are constantly getting bullied at, things could escalate and a child's depressions could sadly lead to suicide which has happened before. I believe this could sometimes be resolved by switching schools but it all comes down to what the student believes is best for them.

In conclusion I believe most of the time being home schooled isn't the best option for a student. I believe a child is much happier at a public environment where they can makes friends at. A child being home schooled doesn't really get a chance to make friends the way they would in a public or private school. A students mental health could be effected by being home schooled and it could also effect them in an emotional way as well because they could could feel lonely and be uncomfterable going to a public place since they only get a chance to interact with their family and teacher. In cases it is to a students benefit to be home schooled though for example if they are being bullied sometimes it's best for them to be home school so they don't feel like they are in danger of something happening to them.          ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear principal,

I think that we should all do community service. When we perform community service we help our community. I cant think of a reason why you would want to stop helping the community. Considering the fact that its our community and if we don't clean it and help the people in it no one will. So eventually our community will have to be shut down . Then were would we live and wouldn't you feel guilty knowing your the reason we have to shut down the community and move somewhere else. I know I would feel absolutely horrible, because a lot of people don't have the money to move.

We should also do community service just for the good of it. There is no better feeling in the world than knowing you did a good deed or helped someone. We could help by going into the classes and helping the younger kids so the teachers can get more work done and wont have to work overtime. We could also help pick up litter and trash on the side off the road so other people don't have to do it instead they can spend time with their family.

We shouldn't be absorbed in the stuff that we personally want to do because this stuff needs to be done its not just something we want to be done. This is so much more important then getting to watch television or play your video game because when you do this you actually accomplish something. You may say well if i don't watch this show i wont get to accomplish finishing the season or i just accomplished getting to the next level in this video game. But those are just little accomplishments that only matter to you and maybe your friends. Accomplishing community service matter to a lot more people and is more important. So please don't stop us from doing what really matters.

"I would go with policy 1. I would go with policy 1 because during lunch there's really nothing much to do. Another reason i would go with policy 1 is because when we have free time, all you do is walk around and talk. Most students may walk around a lot, the reason i think of this is because i have seen it. Lately or rarely when we have free time, people walk around a lot. So then the teacher is like always telling them to sit down and it kind of gets annoying. So again at lunch. You go and get your lunch to eat, talk, laugh, and so on. Which is cool but then, what can we do? Normally what happens is that they get in line, get their food, sit down and eat. So after that what is there to do?

"Advantages and Disadvantages of Working Alone vs Working in a Group

Working alone and working in a group have their own advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will analyze the benefits and drawbacks of both methods, and explore the importance of communication skills in achieving success.

Working alone has its own advantages, such as being able to work at your own pace and being able to focus solely on your work. Additionally, you have complete control over your work, and you can work in a way that suits your learning style. However, working alone also has its own disadvantages, such as the lack of social interaction and the potential for isolation.

On the other hand, working in a group has its own advantages, such as the ability to learn from others and the potential for collaboration. When working in a group, you can share ideas and work together to achieve a common goal. Additionally, working in a group can provide a sense of community and social interaction, which can be beneficial for mental health. However, working in a group also has its own disadvantages, such as the potential for conflict and the need to compromise.

In order to achieve success in group work, it is important to have strong communication skills. Effective communication is essential for sharing ideas, resolving conflicts, and achieving a common goal. In an academic setting, strong communication skills can help students work together effectively and achieve success on group projects. In a professional setting, strong communication skills can help colleagues work together and achieve success in their careers.

Group work can also help achieve a goal faster. When working in a group, you can pool your resources and work together to achieve a common goal. This can lead to faster completion of tasks and more efficient use of time. Additionally, working in a group can provide a sense of accountability, which can motivate individuals to work harder and achieve their goals faster.

Working with people with different ideas, skills, and perspectives can also be beneficial. When working with people who have different perspectives, you can learn from others and gain new insights into a problem. Additionally, working with people who have different skills can help you learn new things and improve your own skills.

In conclusion, both working alone and working in a group have their own advantages and disadvantages. Working alone provides the benefits of being able to work at your own pace and having complete control over",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Exploring New Places

""Studying the planets is a amazing thing,"" said my science teacher. When studying the planets there is a lot of information to take in. The atomposhere on Earth is very different from the atmosphere in space. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Scientists should study Venus because it has similarites to Earth, they have the idea of sending humans to Venus, and also studying the dangers of Venus can help scientists conclude their idea of what it is like there.

Venus is known as Earth's twin. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it states in paragraph 4 ""Today, Venus still ahs some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This proves that Venus has some identical features to those that Earth has. It also states in paragraph 4 ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This also proves that Venus has some similar characteristics like Earth. This is how the Earth is similar to Venus and why scientist should continue to study the planet, consdering its dangers.

The idea of sending humans to Venus is a topic up for debate by many scientists. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains how NASA has the idea of sending humans to Venus. It states in paragraph 5 ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This shows how scientists have come up with a way to send humans to Venus, even though no human has set foot on another planet. The author also states in paragraph 5 ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not excceed Earth levels."" This also shows how the radiation of Venus is not much different than Earth's and it would not exceed higher on Venus, so a human would be safe from radiation on Venus. Sending humans to Venus is another reason why the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursiut even though it has many dangers.

With many great exeptions of studying Venus and sending humans there, the author also shows the dangers of Venus. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author states in paragraph 3 ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This proves that is dangerous to travel to Venus with high tempertures that would burn a human alive. The author also states in paragraph 3 ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" This also proves that Venus has expentionally high temperatures that no human can face. These are the dangers that the author takes into consideration when sending humans to Venus.

In conclusion, the author from ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. After evaluating the article, the author supports the idea of studing Venus. Scinetists should study Venus because it has similarities to Earth, they have the idea of sending humans to Venus, and also studying the dangers of Venus can help scientists conclude their idea of what it is like there.

"Working in a team can be a beneficial endeavor for many reasons. Studies have shown that when individuals are part of a team, they are more likely to have better ideas and more efficient outcomes. Being in a collaborative environment can encourage creativity, foster open communication, and provide an opportunity to mentor and learn from each other.

When working in a team, members’ different skills, experiences, and backgrounds can be applied to the task at hand. Having diverse perspectives can help to create and develop innovative ideas and solutions. Working in a team also allows individuals to use their individual strengths to their advantage, creating a powerful combination to benefit the team.

Team work also promotes shared responsibility and understanding. When each individual in a team has a role to play, the risk of failure is reduced; if the task isn’t accomplished, the entire team will work together to find a solution. Additionally, working in groups encourages members to become better listeners and communicators, which can improve not only the task at hand, but also relationships between team members. 

In conclusion, working in a team provides many benefits that cannot be gained working alone. Working with a diverse set of individuals can lead to better ideas, enhanced productivity, and improved team dynamics. When tasks are shared and each individual does their part, amazing results can be achieved. Therefore, the advantages of working together far outweigh the benefits of working alone.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"I disagree with the school offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. Because i believe that student would not be learn anything, and they will be not focusing on there class. Parents would distract them or if they have a younger brother they might go and play with him. Taking a online class you spent most of you time inside not outside, and that affects you health. Many students would not have any friend to pay with, because they will be not going into a school. Also, they won't be able to do activities, and they won't experience any new thing everyday. Students can learn something else by going to school.

First, A student taking a online class at home that might be difficult, because there would be a lot on noses for the student, and that will make him lose focus. Parent would ask the student to do favors for them if they are home taking online class. If a student has sibling that will not help the student to work on their class instead they might just go to play with his siblings. The student might have a hard time hearing the teacher or listing to the teacher, because their connection might not be that great. It's hard for a teacher to explain something online or video conferencing.

Second, students won't be able to do activities outside and they won't be having any fun with friends as well, because they will be taking classes at their houses. They are not going to be social with anyone except their teacher, and their health might become not so wonderful, because they will be spending most of their time in inside a house. Student will not reach their limits if they are learning at their house. If the student is talking to the teacher the teacher might not be able to understand the student and that will be horrible for both of them.

Third, the student can become unhealthy, because he or she will be inside most of the time studying. Also, the student will learn how to get on time at school or drive safe because ho or she will be going to a school with other kids. If the student goes in a school she or he will learn how to respect some else, and the student will learn more, like leaning about boundaries at school. If a student goes in to a school he or she might get in to a relationship and that will be good for the student rather then the student just staying home.

Student can improve his or hers skills by going to a school. Such's being more social, playful, and friend full.

Finally, By not going to a school you become more isolated and you dont't spend more time with friends. Sometime you don't understand your teacher or you can't learn by your self, because you can't hear the teacher or the teacher can't heir you. That's why you need to go to a school where you can learn with other students. Their are a fewer benefit from attending classes at home, and there are greater benefit when you go to school. When you go to school you have a lot of fan also you can talk with a teacher in person and show him your work or show something that you din't understand.

Overall their are more opportunities when you go to a school, you learn new things not like when you stay home taking a class. You spent more time with friends and the teacher can be more passion it with you. Learning online can heart your well being. And more people would rather go to school then taking a online class. It's more teachable if a student goes to a school. Students gain better abilities when they go to school. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"A Helpful Change in Your Lifestyle

Can you tell the air feels different? Over the past years some countries have put restirctions on car usage. Although this may sound extremely crazy to some, most individuals accept the new law's for car's. Motorized vehicles have put a tole on our environment, our well being, and our wallets. By certain countries banning the use of motorized vehicles it has allowed individuals stress level to decrease, lowered air pollution, and increase money that citizens have. Gas cars that create pollution are a thing of the past, we are moving to electric cars, bicycles, and more; the future is changing and its for our own benefits.

Cars are one of the main sources for people's stress, whether it be because of car failures, others who annoy you while you drive, or the fact you can never find a parking spot.  Heidrun Walter claims "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much mappier this way ( In German suburb, Life goes on without Cars 3)."" One main reason people are less tense and stress is because people do not have to constantly worry about if another car is about to hit them, if traffic is going to be to slow to get to work, or if your car is going to breakdown on you. Car's create unwanted stress that can be easily avoided. Indeed life would be very different without cars people in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have all been able to function properly without motorized vehicles.  In fact ""70 percdent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold cars to move her (In German Suburbs, Life goes on without Cars 3)."" These individuals have proven that it is okay to make a switch. In order for you to reduce stress in your life, you have to take away the source of stress, and that is what citizens have done, and without cars majority of people are happier and healthier.

Due to citizen's of Bogota, Paris, and Germany not using cars and having to switch to bikes, walking, and electric bikes; has greatly reduced toxic gases in the environment. Due to individulas in Paris not excessively using cars the amount of smog has reduced. According to Robert Duffer "" after days of near-record pollutions, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city( Paris bans driving due to smog 10)."" Paris has enforced strict rules that rejects people from driving, also a switch to diesel fuels. In return these ideas have lowered the level of smog in Paris creating a cleaner environment for the citizen. Not only has Paris help reduce toxic gases from entering our environment, but so has Bogota. In the article Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky stated that this has been Bogota's ""thrid year straight that cars have been banned for one day"" and the only motorized vehicles they have used are ""buses"". This switched has dramatically cut traffic, rush hour, and the amount of smog left in the air. Although there is still traces of pollution after this day it has lowered. The reasons are simple, using less cars makes less gases, also those who go the day without using cars may like the change better and permantely switch to a lifestyle without cars.

Another thing that has been changed due to the limitation of car usages is that with individuals not having to buy a car, pay for insurance, and pay for gas, it  has increased the amount of money citizens have in their wallets. Citizens of the United States of America have not exactly chosen to not use cars, but some have, the main reason Citizen of America have limited themself is due to a lack of money. During our ""recession"" Americans were ""unemployed"" and ""unable to pay (The end of car culture 32)."" Because citizens were not able to pay for cars, they did not use them, thus as you get adapted to a new situation you tend to stay with it. After the switch citizens who chose to continue a life without a car, were able to have more money because they didnt have to pay for the cost that come with a car. Now some citizens have made the switch to not using motorized vehicles, which has helped increase the amount of money citizens have, which is always an advantage because you are able to pay for other things that are neccasary to your life.

Although cars seem like a material object that is so precious to life, it's not. In all reality people can live a life without cars, citizens in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have, and they enjoy it. Its time to make a switch and make a helpful change in your lifestyle. A life without cars is very benefitial, it is less stressful, lowers pollution, and has an increases of money. Although not using cars is a bit extreme, you can always make a better switch to using electric products, which can also help lower the amount of toxic gases in the air. Gas car's that produce extreme levels of gases are a thing of the past, I believe its time to move to the future.            ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Do you ever wonder if the face on mars is just a landform? I've thought about it and I have read this story called ""Unmasking The Face on Mars"" this story really showed me that the face on mars is just a landform. First, it was just a shadow that caught NASA's eye. Second, it was shown has a huge rock formation. Finally, they thought it was a alien markings.

When NASA first saw this they thought it looked like a face. A few days after that it says in the caption ""...the illusion of eyes nose, and mouth."" (3) But as it say it is a illision which means it plays tricks on your mind to make you think that's what you saw. This ""face"" appeared on the Viking 1 spacecraft.

Next the illision of the face was really just a rock formation. Qouted from the passage it says ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head..."" (3) This proves that it's just a rock in the shape of a human's face/ head. It also says in that same passage ""It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Therefor this shows this it really was just a illision and that people really just wanted attention for mars.

Finally, the main thought of as a alien momument. This was proved wrong by the Mars Global Surveyor when it flew over Cydonia snappining a picture. These pictures were ten times sharper than the Viking 1 photos shot twenty five years ago. In the passage it states that ""the MOC team snapped a picture and it was 10x sharper than the first taken by the Viking 1 photos.""(7) This states that the Viking photos weren't good enough because it didn't show as much. After these pictures were taken they were then posted on the JPL web site that revealed it was just a natural landform.

After all of this you can conclude that the 'Face of Mars"" is just a landform. I've given you facts and statistics showing that this is true. Therefore with this proof it is a landform not a face or a alien monument after all. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"When scientists first saw the face, they figured it was just another Martian mesa. Martian mesa's are pretty common in Cydonia, and this is the only one that had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. After NASA looked at it for a few days they let it out to the public. Scientists believed it was a huge rock formation that just ""looks"" like a human head. Then, they said that the shadows made it look like it had a nose, eyes, and mouth.

The first web site the Face ever appeared on was JPL web site. It showed a natural land form, and no alien monument after all. However, Alien Researchers believe that since MGS had to peer through whispy clouds to see the face that alien markings were hidden by the haze. Because of this, Mission controllers took a second trip. They took better pictures than the Viking photo and had great results.

Garvin was the Mission Controller in command and he points out that that things in a digital come up three times bigger than the original image. He also says, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what the were!"" He tells us that this is rule of thumb and that he knows what he is doing because this is his job. From this point it would crealy state, comming for Mission Control, that it is in fact not an alien siting.

Lastly, some students might not feel comfortable participating in the activities, and they should have a say in if they want to participate.

Some students have to help their parents, after school, with things that are much more important than these activities. Students may live on a farm, and have to help out with it daily. Other students do not have both parents to help with chores, so they have to help a lot. Some students might have a younger sibling or a pet at home that they have to help out with if the parents need it, or if the parents are not home. So, a number of students have to help with very important things, instead of participating in these activities.

Some students might have a job in the after school hours. Jobs are very important to students, and can help pay for things if their parents are not financially stable. Jobs can teach students important life skills that they will need in their near future. Some jobs will teach you a lot about having a job, you can use that when you get out of school to help get better jobs. In conclusion, if the principal forces these students to participate, then they will have to quit their jobs and lose all of these important qualities of having a job.

Lastly, some students may not feel comfortable participating in extracurricular activities. A number of students may not be social, and do not like being around people. Other students may have something physically wrong with them, and they can not participate in the activity that they want to, leaving them feeling left out. Students might not like any of the activities available, so it just makes their life that much more miserable and stressful. So, if you force these students into participating, they may feel uncomfortable and nervous, when they could just have the choice to not participate.

In conclusion, my disagreement with the principal has many good reasons behind it. I think that it should be recommended to participate, but you do not absolutally have to. The school should think about the important things that the students have to do on their own time. And if a students tries the activities and feels uncomfortable the should be able to stop doing the activity, and not be forced to do it. No student should ever be forced to do something, because not all students are the same.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principle,

I think that changing the school policy is a good thing because people that want to play sports will try to do better in school and we will have more people doing better because they play sports. professional athletes wouldn't go any where if they didn't do good in school. In the NBA people have to be smart to remember the plays and all the things they need to do to score or to stop the other team from scoring.

When i played sports I would have to remember where to throw and where to run. my coach always said school before baseball if I was getting bad grades he wouldn't play me so I always did good in school. Some times i would have to do a project so I would miss practice or a game. every time i told him it was school work he would understand. He used to be a teacher so he wanted us to do really good in school.

My Basketball coach said that if we missed school don't come to practice because he wanted us to do really good in school. when we don't want to go to school we say just suck it up so we can go to school. i never missed a practice with my coaches.

that is why I think we should change the school policy also when people are close to getting kicked off the team they will try as hard as they can to stay on the team.      ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Limiting car usage can be helpful to people and the earth in a variety of ways. Although cars are helpful to a numerous amount of people and can help one get from point A to point B, there are reasons why it can be harmful and why reducing the use of cars can make a huge impact on the world. First it can lower air pollution, it causes less traffic congestion, and lastly it reduces greenhouse emissions. These are some important advantages on limiting car usage.

One way that reducing car usage can be beneficial is that it lowers air pollution. Some countries have already took advantage and began to limit their usage of vehicles. In Colombia, Bogota several cities have had a ""car free day"". According to source 3, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says that"" Its a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". Municipal authorities from different countries came to Colombia experience this event and were extremely excited. Reducing car usage is proven to help the world out.

Getting to work can be a pain, simply because of long, time wasting traffic jams. This can cause people to be late to work, functions, emergencies, and even important interview. It may even cause them to miss it completely. Lowering the usage of automobiles can be pivotal mainly for this reason. In source 3, Robert Duffer states that ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france after five days of intensifying smog"". This is a important advantage of limiting car usage.

Another way that decreasing the use of cars is that it cuts down the greenhouse gas emissions. According to the first source the author states that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United Stated. This is an big reason on limiting car usage as it is shown that it can help the earth

It is evident that limiting vehicle usage is pivotal, and the various advantages of what it can lead to. Factors such as lowering air pollution, less traffic jams, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These are reason why we should limit car usage    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I believe that we should leave the world of driverless cars alone. I think there will be too many problems with the cars in the future. For example, what if there's a glitch or other problem with the car while someone is driving the car and injures somebody. Whose at fault for the accident?

If we move forward in the process of creating driverless cars it's going to cost a lot of money for the project. They would have to come up with the money to buy the car, the cameras, the computers, the GPS, etc. It would cost a ton of money. Not to mention all the labor costs, and what about the roads? They would have to find a way for the car to drive on the road. Doing anything to the roads would be bad enough. How much money do people want to spend just trying to make a car that drives itself. We would spend all that money and then the car would have too many problems.

Roads are being made and taken up all the time. to make this car they would have to find a way to make the roads to where the car could drive on them and then find a way for the car to recognize where those roads are. What are they going to use so the car can find the correct roads that are safe to drive on? That is definetly something that they would need to figure out.

Another problem is what are they going to do with all the other peoples' cars that don't drive themselves after they do all this work just to make a driverless car? Are the roads still going to be able to be driven on by old cars that aren't driverless? I think that there are too many questions that need to be answered before we even consider making a car that drives itself.

If we do create a completely driverless car, how much will it cost? They would've spent propably thousands if not millions on the car, so how much would it cost? If they make the car, I think it would be one of those things where only certain people could get it because it would cost so much. Just for them to break even on the car they would propably have to sell it for a ton of money.

I believe that we should not move forward in the project to build a driverless car. There are too many quesions that need to be answered. They would have to find many different way for the car to work, like the roads, GPS's, the computers in the cars. There is to many things for them to work out. I don't think the world is ready yet for driverless cars. Maybe in the next fifty to a hundered years or so, but not yet. The world just isn't ready for it yet in my opinion.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Hey there!  So, distance learning... hmmm... 

I think it's pretty cool that we can learn from home and stuff, but there are some cons too.  Like, paying attention and understanding lessons online can be hard.  I mean, I can get distracted easily, and if I'm not in a classroom, it's way easier to get lost in my own thoughts.  And if I don't understand something, it's harder to ask for help. 

But, on the bright side, it's way more flexible for people who live far away from school.  Like, if I'm sick or something, I can just stay in bed and learn from home.  And I don't have to worry about getting to school on time or anything.  That's pretty cool, right? 

But, um, there might be some stress too.  Like, if I'm not in a classroom, I might not get as much help as I need.  And if I'm not paying attention, I might miss something important.  And what if I have questions?  It's not like I can just ask my teacher in private. 

So, I don't know...  I think it's a pretty mixed bag, you know?  But I guess it could be good for some people.  Just not me, maybe. 

Anyway, that's my two cents.  What do you think?  Do you think distance learning is a good idea?  Let me know what you think!",1,llama2_chat,1
"In the world of education, there have been many arguments about which way of learning could benefit the most people. Some agree that the system we have now is the pinnacle of what we can do to help younger generations learn. However, there is definitely more we could do so the next firemen or police officers in line don't make the same mistakes we have. One of these things is autonomy, the chance to build a new road for one's self. Who wouldn't love the true freedom to become anything by just working to improve skills? One of these bits of autonomy is the chance to try distance learning.

What is distance learning? It is when a child decides to take school from home, online, or have video courses with a teacher. It isn't exactly homeschooling or tutoring, in the sense that instead of having a family member, or specialized teacher come to enlighten; rather, it is when a teacher from the school that the student has probably gone to takes the time to teach one-on-one, along with online courses. As of now, only a percentage of schools allow this, but if this opportunity were introduced to more schools, the whole county would have a higher success overall for two reasons: it helps those who learn better in a small environment, and there isn't the stress of actually going to school.

There are many children all over the world with social anxiety, learning disabilities, or who are just very introverted. When compared to the much more prominent demographic, they are often looked over and left out. If, however, we put them in a more solitary environment, they most likely would excel in academic studies, due to it being less stressful for them. Just imagine people running all about, bumping into and pushing others, when they normally can't even go up to the staff to ask for help. Having the choice of distance learning could take away that stress, and open a whole new road for them to go.

There are others that, unlike the people in the last paragraph, love socializing. They go out a lot, talk with their friends every day, and just love being around people, but there is just one problem; they absolutely loathe the school system and the way it sucks the life out of them. Well, if they tried distance learning, those students wouldn't have the troubles of the system lingering over them, and they could just get the work done. Sure, one would say that it takes away valuable social time, but if one thinks about it, it could also leave some free time to hang out with friends. Having that option, they wouldn't have to worry about whether or not they're precisely following the rules, if they're causing too much of a ruckus, or simply about what others might think of them.

Autonomy is a wonderful thing. It's nice to just relax and not feel like you have to go down a certain path. I do agree, though, that there needs to be some rules so people won't take advantage of everything. Distance learning is the very middle of those two extremes, understanding that one has the power to be anything they want as long as they work hard, while also knowing that there are still certain tasks they need to accomplish, and certain rules they need to abide by while doing said task. If we all let the small stars shine, they will shine brighter than any other.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Senator,

Some agree and some disagree about it. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. I am one of those people who agree with it because it avoids run-off elections and because of the big states populatons.

I agree in what the third source said: ""the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" for example Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43% plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively)."" So the way i see it is its kind of a back up plan. To ensure others that there will be something there just in case popular votes or what not doesn't work as planned or correctly.

I also agree with what is said in the third source about evening out the larger states compared to the smaller ones. For example, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution..."" The reason why i agree to this is because since the state is larger then others, there are more people there, so therefore when they do vote the popular vote will be larger than the smaller states. So the Electoral College equals things out.

Run-offs are avoided and big states compared to smaller ones are equals, that is why I agree with keeping the Electoral College the same. I mean it was made like it is for a reason. Why do others want to change something if there are very good and valid reasons for why its already being the way it is.

"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

Many people enjoy the idea of community service; others do not.

I believe that students have the right to choose what they would rather do, instead of being forced to do so.

Some kids already do some community service.

It would mainly affect the kids that don't.

Even though community service is the right thing to do, it should not be forced upon anybody.

The students need some of their own freedom.

We are already facing being a teenager and school.

We need to be able to make a few more decisions in our everyday lives.

On the other hand, every student performing community service will help the city extremely well.

The streets will be cleaner, the buildings shinier, and the gardens greener.

Everyone in the city will leave their homes with a smile on their face!

For example, one of my friends volunteers at an elementary school as a tutor.

He enjoys it a lot, especially when one of the kids gets a good grade on something he taught them.

However, some of my other friends don't like the idea of community service because it takes away from their free time.

Personally, I am not liking the idea of being forced to make the city a better place.

It shouldn't be part of the curriculum.

The students should make the decision themselves.

Thank you,

"To the principal:

I believe that all students should not be required to perform in community service. Some of the students just have too much on there plate already, then throw in something else, it will cause much drama that the school does not need. Even though community service is a great way to help out and fix things in your community it will just take up way to much time your students lives. The downside to not having every student involved in community is that colleges look at the student and their extra activities they are involved in outside of school. I know that would help some students that are going to college on a academic and sports scholarship but yet again it would have seen a waste to some of the students that are planning on not attending college. This year if i would have been forced to do community service it would have been a hassle for me since i play football and i am in double advance classes that takes up most of our evenings and sometimes even our weekends. Overall community service should not be required to all students maybe the ones who do not have anything to do after school or on the weekends that would be great but those who play a sport or are in a group, club or something like that it would not suit them well. All though community service is a very debated topic around the schools in our nation. It is as big as the board of education. So in the next few years we might see a law passed from the president concerning community service involvement in schools.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Projects is like supreme pizza. Each project consists of many details and ideas, which combines as one big main idea. Not all projects are boring though; coloring and drawing plays a huge role in how the project is represented. My science fair project involved bright colorful headings with colored pictures on a poster board displaying how gravity affects light fragile objects. Summer projects should be student-designed because it requires students to challenge themselves, it allows students to be creative, and it helps teachers receive feedback.

One reason summer projects should be student-designed is because it pushes students to face a big challenge. For instance, last year my English teacher assigned a project to complete based on the book

Animal Farm by George Orwell. She explained we needed to design the format and organization of the main idea without going off topic. I struggled to think of a theme for my own for days. After planning for a while, I decided to illustrate pigs on their hind legs with ribbons, a horse, a sheep, a cow, and several guard dogs for the pigs. This project required me to think outside the box and was the most difficult one I was assigned.

Another reason students should design summer projects is because it allows students to be creative. For example, my Spanish teacher always assigns chapter projects, and the most recent I did was about the train station. I was allowed to make the project in anyway as long as I used the right grammar and all of the vocabulary stated in the chapter. First, I wrote a dialogue between an employee and customer with a variety of colored pens. Next, I illustrated small pictures for the vocabulary. Then, I glued the dialogue and pictures onto light yellow construction paper. Lastly, I designed the title with bubble letters and a blue colored pencil.

In addition, summer projects should be designed by students because it helps teachers analyze the students idea and theme of the project. For instance, I was given a project on trade routes in my advanced placement history class. My teacher addressed me to design the project in anyway about one out three trade routes. I chose the Trans-Saharan trade route and made a pamphlet that tourists would use to travel. I explained what food was there, what the climate was like, what they mainly traded, what was most interesting about the Trans-Saharan, what transportation thats provided, and what to avoid while traveling there. Once she graded my project she had a meeting with me about the way I expressed the trade route. She told me the idea was extremely creative and the information I used was excellent. However, she said the pamphlet would be more neat if I organized it and added pictures for examples.

Some students argue teacher-designed projects are more of a learning experience. However, student-designed projects teaches students how to be independent and responsible. For example, this year I was assigned a project on

Julius Caesar , and I was to compare two different characters by using my own theme. I came up with three different sections for the project on my own without help; I made two slogans and wrote one speech in the positive character's point of view. I had a week to complete the project and present it in class. The deadline and the whole project taught me how to manage my time more consistently, it taught me how to work alone, and it taught me how to be responsible for my own grades.

Moreover, summer projects should be student-designed to help students have a more knowledgeable education. I propose students write a letter to their principle about why students should design their own summer projects. As a student I would like to receive the best education so I am more likely to succeed in the near future. Designing my own summer project helps keep my mind fresh and helps me grow more wise as a person. Having to face a challenge myself, to be able to be creative, and to help my teachers receive feedback are reasons summer projects need to be designed by students. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

I believe that students who have a C should be able to go out for any sport they choose. I've heard that a C is average. They have spent most of the day in school and i think they should have a little free time. I know they should raise their grade a little bit but they can also stay for detentions so they wont have to miss their football game or other stuff that they like to do. Its not fair to the students who have a C that are very good at a sport than those who have an A or B that are bad at sports.

Students are going to argue and argue until they can play their sports so if you would be kindly to take this policy off. I lot of students would appreciate it so they wouldn't keep arguing. Maybe some of these student who have a C can grow up to be a professional soccer or football player or any other professional sport. They have dreams too you know just like you when you were little. Didn't you have dreams to become a principal. So why don't you let them play so they can accomplish their dream just like you did. I appreciate you taking your time to read this letter.

"Dear Principal,

I do not think that community service should be mandatory because unless someone is jailed or imprisoned, even the law can't force them to do community service. I think it is unfair to force students to do community service because it is their decision to make. I am not saying that community service is bad. Actually, I think that I should do it more often. But you have to give the students a chance to make their own decisions as what to do for extracurricular activities. Imagine if every year, you were assigned an extracurricular activity. No fun in choosing it! Students should be able to choose what they want to do outside of school hours and off of the school grounds.

Another problem with this idea of community service is that it could take away from valuable family time and other activities, such as sports, parties, and even just taking a day and doing nothing. Students have less free time than ever nowadays. Are you saying that you want them to have even less free time? Preposterous! I know that I sound a little vehement, but I think community service is a great idea. Maybe you could have a community service volunteer extracurricular activity. Speaking from a student's perspective, the best thing you could do to lower morale around SCHOOL_NAME Middle School is force the students to do something that they don't want to do. I agree that a volunteer-based community service extracurricular activity would be very good, and I might even take part in it. But you already send us to school for 7 hours a day. Do you have to take away our free time, too?

I stand completely and vehemently opposed to a forced community service activity for many reasons. Most of the students wouldn't try at all with the community service. Imagine a bored eighth grader that has to read to a group of cute little kindergartners. The student puts no effort into it and comes across as unmotivated and stupid. Now that would be a great way to lower your school's reputation.

Mandatory community service is just a bad idea all the way around the whole wheel. The kids wouldn't even have their heart in it. It would lower the morale around the school. Even some teachers are probably opposed to the idea of mandatory community service, and they would be unhappy. Your school's reputation would go down. You would take away the students' free time. You would take away their sports. Their activities. Their time with friends. Their time to do homework (don't you want them to do that?) . Their time to explore their passion and find things out about themselves. Their time to do anything. So, please, I beg you, I implore you to not make community service mandatory for all the students in the school.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some of us couldn't imagine going to work without a car. Well in some parts of the world, they are completely getting rid of cars. There are many advantages of not using cars all that much, some like, there would be a lot less smog and polluted air. People's moods may change, and there are plenty of other ways of transportation.

To start off, Paris has had near record pollution. There has been times of five day intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Just imagine what that is doing to our ozone layer. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. So if we stopped using cars for a while, maybe the smog around the world would start to clear up, and maybe if we stopped using cars for even longer we would be completely smog-less.

Secondly, people would probably start to be in a better mood and feel happier. Driving a car can be stressful and even sometimes intense. Heidrun Walter says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. She walks the streets of Vauban. The chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional sound of a distant motor.

Lastly, there are so many different ways to get from place to place. In some Colombian cities they have replaced pitted sidewalks so people can ride their bikes instead of drive. In Bogota in the mid-1990s they began to make bike paths, to this day it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle pathways. In New York there is a new bike sharing program that is skyrocketing. People needing to get to work can walk or take public transportation, they can even car-pool with a friend or another family member.

To conclude, laying off the use of cars could be a pretty good change to our environment, to us, and to other people and even our health. Walking, riding a bicycle and riding on public transportation is woven into a connected network to save time, conserve our resources, lower the toxic emissions to the air, and to improve our safety and the worlds safety.         ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I agree with the decision to mandate all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It allows students to discover and explore many different activities that potentially could be a career path one desires to pursue, allows for students to make new friends, and teaches students teamwork and leadership.

Participating in an extracurricular activity allow students to discover many different activities that can potentially be a career one desires to pursue. Studies indicate that 65% of students who participate in an extracurricular activity at a young age pursue an occupation that utilizes/relates to a skill pertained while participating in the extracurricular activity. Students are also exposed more to the field that their club relates with. The main reason why I want to be either a senator or a computer scientist when I grow up is that I currently participate in the Model United Nations club as well as the Computer Science club. If I hadn't participate in those two clubs, my career choices would most likely be different because I wouldn't of been exposed to that area. A student who participates in an extracurricular activity also gains more knowledge in that area of expertise which can result in that student finding a profession relating to that activity with less difficulty than a someone who hasn't been as exposed or knowledgeable.

Participating in an extracurricular activity allows students to make new friends. The main reason why a student would join an extracurricular club is because they are interested in what that specific club does. A student who joins the Computer Science club is introduced to other students who share a common interest: Computers. The majority of after school clubs meet on a weekly basis, some more than others. Nevertheless, students in an after school club would see the same students at least one time a week. This provides each and every one of the students the chance to interact with each other and befriend one another. With this in mind, joining an extra curricular activity allows students to make new friends.

The majority of extracurricular activities teach students teamwork and leadership. Students that are part of extracurricular activities that compete such as the football team or Science Olympiad must rely on each other in order to win the competition. Other clubs such as Model United Nations illustrate the importance of both as students must work with and lead other students towards resolving the conflict. No matter what club students participate in, they require an important skill: the ability to effectively and diligently work with others in order to reach a common goal. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity provides them the opportunity to learn teamwork and leadership; a lifelong skill.

In conclusion, I agree with the decision to make students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It allows students the chance to discover and further investigate many different many different activities which potentially could be the career path a student desires to pursue, gives the chance for students to make new friends, and teaches students teamwork and leadership. It's in the student's best interest to join an extracurricular activity because even though it requires extra time out of the student's day, It teaches lifelong skills him/her can use throughout life and makes it easier to find his/her way through life, no matter what club a student decides to participate in. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Children are full of emotions, and therefore are confused alot. So it comes as no suprise why some children struggle in school. It is apparent that what schools are doing now isn't helping these children. All teachers are different, they have different points of view, different styles on thow they teach. These opposing views make all teachers different and could confuse their students. With a computer however, there could be meximum proformance. The children would learn better and more than they were before. Computers that read emotions could benifit schools and the nation.

Computers reading emotions could be a huge step in the right direction. Children could easily learn what is going on and if they do not the computer can evaluate that and change what it is doing. Dr. Haung explains ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"". The computer knows alot of different facial expressions and therefore can easily and quickly evaluate what the child's problem is, and fix it. The computer knows the students emotions and could easily diagnose problems and help the child to better understand what they are doing.

The computer could also learn to take disiplenry action to the child. Which if the child has violent tendencies could lead to some major conflict. If the child knows that the ocmputer is expensive he/she is less liekly to hit it. The computer may even be able to stop a bad situations before it even begins by anylising the situation by reading emotion. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness"". Anger is one of the emotions the computer can detect and could rush into a situaltion(granted it have some way of getting around) and fix or mediate the problem with facts. For diciplenry action computers would bring grat dicipline to the classroom.

Teachers in the future could be more like operators, if something happens to the computer the teachers could work on or fix the computer. Over time this could lead to the teaching industry dissappearing. Children may not think this is good and there would definently be a lack of emotion from the ""teacher"" in the classroom seeing as it is a computer. But there is too much advantage obver disavantage. All in all teachers would still have jobs but wouldnt be as active. Which would put less stress on teachers, which in turn, would maximise proficiency.

Emotion reading computers would not only benifit schools but the nation as a whole. Computers could read the emotions of each individual child and see chat works and what dosen't. The computers can also mediate arguments and take diciplenry action when needed. And teachers would have a much easier job at managing and teaching the students. Schools around the world need this new state of the art computer system to help read emotions and prepare children for the brightest future. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Hey, so like, I'm totally stoked to be writing this essay on whether students should commit to a career at a young age. I mean, it's like, a super important topic and all.

So, first off, let's talk about the pros of committing to a career early. Like, if you know what you want to do when you grow up, it's way easier to focus on your studies and get the right training and experience. It's like, you can start building your skills and knowledge early on, and then you'll be way more prepared when it's time to enter the workforce. Plus, it's just way more practical. I mean, why waste time figuring things out when you're older, when you could just figure it out now?

But, like, there are also some cons to committing to a career early. For one thing, it can be really limiting. Like, if you're only focused on one thing, you might miss out on other opportunities and experiences that could be really valuable. And it's also, like, really hard to change your mind if you've already committed to something. So, if you're not sure what you want to do, it's better to take your time and explore different options.

Another thing to consider is that, like, some people might not be ready to commit to a career at a young age. Maybe they're still figuring out who they are and what they want to do, and that's totally fine. It's important to take your time and not feel pressured to make a decision that you're not comfortable with.

So, in conclusion, I think it's important to weigh the pros and cons of committing to a career early. It's not always the right choice for everyone, and it's important to be patient and take your time when making this decision.

"The United States is a government that is ruled by the people through elected representatives, but do the citizens really have power? The Electoral College proccess does not give the citizens all of the power that they shoud be entitled to. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (p10) If a United States citizen wanted to vote for a certain candidate, they would vote for electors pledged to that candidate instead of directly voting for them. As a government who is ""run by the people"", the government surely has strict power over things that should be left up to the people to decide. The eloctoral college is unfair and quite confusing to the citizen of the United States. For example, one candidate beats another by a long shot with popular vote but the other candidate wins by electoral votes, the people still have not chosen the representative. The popular vote would bring honesty to the claim that we have a government who is run by the people.

A change to the election of the president by popular vote  might, in fact, cause some differences and tension across the United States but would cause more relief than it would tension. The people are tired of this out dated process and demand power. Many citizens no longer vote because they think their vote does not count, that it is all up to congress and electors in the end. If the way of popular vote were to be set in place, many people would begin to vote again and would be fullfiling their civic duty. More and more people are begining to have negative feelings towards the government and many feel like their opinions do not matter and that nothing is going to change, that it only gets worse. If enough people come togeher, we can change this old and unfair way of voting and everyone's opinions could make a difference in our nation.

""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a politican prefrence..."" (p23) The electoral College is not a democratic way of voting because you are not voting for a president, you are voting for elctors who in turrn, will vote for the president they want despite the people's vote. The trust that the electors will vote for the party's nominee is rarely betrayed but is still a possibility. The winner-take-all system is in each state and candidates only focus on the ""swing states"". For example, in the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see candidates. Voters in 25 media markets did not see campaign ads. Popular voting will erase the unfair quality of our presidential elections and bring democratic ways back to the USA.

In conclusion, ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (p14) The process in which a president is elected by popular votes is much more feesable and democratic. Many more citizens will be  more likely to vote under this process thus partionally bringing the nation closer to where it should be in the modern term of democracy.                                 ",0,persuade_corpus,2

"From electric cars to deisel semi-trucks, automobiles can hurt the enviornment and people living in that eniviornment. The limiting use of cars can help everyone in some way. It can also save nations millions of dollars to spen on things other than fuel. the world will be a lot better wihtout the usage of cars.

Cars will alaways be a part of the human race, but have you ever had the thought of not using one anymore? In source number 3, it tells about a car-free day in Bogota, Columbia. ""It`s a good opportuniy to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said business man Carlos Arturo Plaza, who was riding a two seat bike with his wife. Using cars can give you a lot of stress behind the wheel because you never know whats going to happen and if you will live another day to drive your car again. In Paris, after days of near-record pollution, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, according to source number 2. France has a tax policy that favors diesels over gasoline. Because of the heavy usage of diesel engines paris typically has more smog than other European capitals.

Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissionsin Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. In Vauban, Germany, an upscale community is letting people who have given up their cars to live there. Source number one state that 70% of the people who live there do not own cars and 57% sold a car to move there. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I`m much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by source number 4 shows. If the pattern persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment. People who stopped commuting may find less reason to resume the habit.

Car usage, the poisen to the enviornment, is a big issue. Wealthy business men who commute an hour to work, soccer moms, and even kids driving to school all rely heavily on car usage. If the issue of limiting vehicles isn`t solved, it must be watched closlely for the coming geneartions. It will continue to effect the human race by the disposing of greenhouse gases, until we figure out a way to limit the usage of cars.               ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home through online or video conferencing has its advantages and disadvantages. While it may seem like a convenient option for some students, it can also have negative effects on student motivation and communication with teachers.

One advantage of distance learning is the convenience it offers to students. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which can be especially beneficial for those who have busy schedules or live far away from their school. This can also help reduce the time and cost of commuting to school, which can be a significant burden for some families.

Another advantage of distance learning is that it allows for greater flexibility in scheduling. Students can choose when and where they want to attend classes, which can be especially beneficial for those who have other commitments, such as part-time jobs or extracurricular activities. This can help students better balance their academic and personal lives.

However, there are also several disadvantages to distance learning. One of the biggest disadvantages is that it can negatively affect student motivation. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track with their studies. Additionally, the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers can make it difficult for students to feel engaged and motivated.

Another disadvantage of distance learning is that it can make communication with teachers more challenging. While technology has made it easier to communicate with teachers through email and messaging apps, it can still be difficult to have the same level of interaction and support that comes with in-person communication. This can make it more difficult for students to ask questions and get the help they need when they need it.

In conclusion, while distance learning has its advantages, it also has its disadvantages. While it may seem like a convenient option for some students, it can also have negative effects on student motivation and communication with teachers. It is important for schools to carefully consider the pros and cons of offering distance learning as an option and to provide the necessary support and resources to ensure that students are able to succeed in this learning environment.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Pursuing activities that make us happy is essential in life. It is easy to get caught up in the daily routine of work, school, and other responsibilities, but it is important to take a step back and focus on what brings us joy. When we prioritize our happiness, we can lead more fulfilling lives and find a sense of purpose.

One of the benefits of pursuing activities that make us happy is that it allows us to recharge and refresh our minds. When we are engaged in activities that we enjoy, we are more likely to feel relaxed and content. This can lead to increased productivity and better performance in other areas of our lives. For example, if we enjoy exercising, we are more likely to be in better physical and mental health, which can improve our overall well-being.

Additionally, pursuing activities that make us happy can help us to develop a sense of purpose. When we engage in activities that we enjoy, we are more likely to feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. This can lead to a greater sense of purpose and direction in life. For example, if we enjoy painting, we may feel a sense of fulfillment in creating something beautiful and expressing ourselves through our art.

It is also important to note that pursuing activities that make us happy can lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and contentment in life. When we engage in activities that we enjoy, we are more likely to feel happy and fulfilled. This can lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and contentment in life, which can improve our overall well-being. For example, if we enjoy spending time with our friends and family, we are more likely to feel a sense of connection and belonging, which can improve our overall happiness and well-being.

In conclusion, pursuing activities that make us happy is essential in life. It allows us to recharge and refresh our minds, develop a sense of purpose, and lead a more fulfilling life. It is important to prioritize our happiness and make time for activities that bring us joy, no matter what they may be. By doing so, we can lead more fulfilling lives and find a greater sense of purpose and direction in life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment,"" is a powerful statement that speaks to the importance of individuality in a society that often values conformity. In today's world, where people are constantly bombarded with messages about what they should look like, what they should wear, and what they should believe, it can be challenging to stay true to oneself. However, as Emerson suggests, the greatest accomplishment is to resist these pressures and to embrace one's own unique identity.

One example of the importance of individuality is seen in the world of art. Throughout history, artists have been celebrated for their ability to create works that are true to their own vision, even when faced with criticism and rejection. For example, Vincent van Gogh's use of bold, vibrant colors and swirling brushstrokes in his paintings was seen as controversial and even madness by some during his lifetime. However, today, his works are celebrated for their unique beauty and emotional depth. Similarly, Pablo Picasso's groundbreaking Cubist style was met with skepticism and resistance at first, but it has since become one of the most influential art movements in history.

Another example of the importance of individuality is seen in the world of business. Entrepreneurs who have succeeded by following their own unique vision and creating a product or service that meets a specific need or desire have changed the world. For example, Steve Jobs' vision for Apple Inc. was to create a company that focused on design and innovation, rather than just following the latest trends. This approach led to the creation of products like the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which revolutionized the music and technology industries.

In addition to these examples, there are countless others throughout history and in the present day where individuals have achieved great success by staying true to themselves. Whether it's in art, business, or any other field, the greatest accomplishments come from those who have the courage to follow their own unique path, even in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment,"" is a powerful reminder of the importance of individuality in a society that often values conformity.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

"Which policy would I want; 1. allow students to use phones during lunch and other free time or 2. don't allow student to use there phones at all. Which would be better? Who knows? Well, as a student I would go with policy number two. Reason for that would be because I like to have my phone available, makes me feel safe, and just feel weird without it.

Having my phone with me makes me feel important. Without it I just seem like some normal kid. Cell phones could also help in good ways. I could use if for researching, calculating and to help see what i want to write.

Also my phone makes me feel safe. To me, not having my phone is like driving a car without seat belts. Also know as dangerous. Sometimes when I think there's an emergency I like to have my phone so I could contact my mom, dad, sister, brother or anybody I need. Phones aren't just for having fun texting, calling, going on the internet or things of that nature. Some kids actually use them for safety reasons and emergencies.

Lastly, I just feel weird not having my phone. Its like a mom having to leave her son at a daycare for the first time. When I don't have a phone it seems like I can feel every text message and phone call vibrate right there in my pocket as if it was there. Then i look dumb looking for it, knowing its not there.

"Dear Principal,

I think you should have a requirement that all students should have to do a certain amount of community service that they need in order to pass the grade. Even if its just painting a bench or helping around the school. I think students should care more about the community and not just about themselves. Maybe if it just for about fifteen minutes once a week, go to a soup kitchen and help out or go to the beach and pick up litter after school. Even if they see litter on the ground just pick it up to be nice to the environment and the community.

I feel that students don't care about the environment, but they would if they knew the future was in there hands, they would help out more. If they did help out then the world may not end so soon or when they are adults they may not regret helping the community because the community would be in better shape. Everywhere they look, there will be no litter, because they did a good job helping the community and they would teach there kids to help out to around the community. If they didn't help then the world may end sooner or they may regret it when they grow up. Also soon they will not be able to swim in the ocean because there will be to mush pollution in the water. I know that i wouldn't like that, so that means a lot of other people wouldn't like it either. Also there kids wouldn't help the environment so the world would get even more polluted.

Also if they help out around the school then maybe if there kids go here then they may have a better education because they don't need to worry about the community or the environment.

This is why i think you should have every student do a least 90 minutes of community service. For the world ends up better. You should make it for they don't pass the grade or something if they don't do the service.

Thank you!!

Have a great day!

"Current education in schools are based on standardlized education with all student having simmilar classes, even if student are confused or bored with class. Which could cause more possibility to fall credits. Because of these problems, the recognizing emotional expressions of student by computer are valuable to prevent left behind than other students.

The emotion recognition technology could bring more computer based education with more personalized class even if one of the student are confused or bored. According to Professor Thomas Huang, from Beckman Institite for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, this technology brings ability to ""Classroom computer could recognize when student is becoming confused or bored"" and ""Modify the lesson, like an effective human instuructor"". Computer emotion recognition techology could bring more ability to make class attractive and prevent student from falling their grades and credits or even giving advanced education for each person.

Also, faking emotion recognition technology is difficult. According to ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, if someone is trying to fake smile, ""mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius"" which makes sytem to recognize false smile. From this technology, with educatuional purpose such as recognizing emotional expressions to prevent left behind student, this will give another creditbility to system even if student tried to deny their actual feelings, such as confuse.

The emotion recognizing software would be valuable to prevent many student from falling grades. The facial recognization have some of problems such as teachers could be easily unempolyed, or privacy problem.

"In the article ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming,¨ the author talkes about positive and negative aspects of having diverless cars. Driverless cars can be very dangerous for they can only operate correctly in the right condicions. These smart cars could be putting peoples lives at risk and cause serious problems, and the only way these problems could be truly solved is with a great abundence of money. Aruguments would accure about whos fault it would be if someone were to get into an accident. Driverless Cars need to be highly improved or not put onto the roads, you should always be more safe than sorry.

Therefore, in this article it says, ¨ all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and aroung accidents¨(7). Showing how dangerous these smart cars can really be. If the car can not work properly in the condicions that are all around us, what makes them safe to have on the roads? As the cars keep devoloping the more dangerous they will become to us humans, if smart cars ever get to the point where they truly are driverless it would not be neraly as safe to be out on the roads. This is because these cars are know to have problem with changes in the road and when they notice this change they are programed to alert the human driver. Thinking of that, what if a child were to run out onto the road, how fast can this car really react, or how fast could this smart care alert the human driver? These driverless cars should be concidered hilgly dangerous to humans for they will never have the power to oberate just as a human could.

To futher explain why these cars could only hurt not help human kind, ¨Originally, many futurist believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday was not so much smarter cars as roads¨(3). This idea would help solve many problems that come along with the diverless car, but therfore would cause a great problem of its own. These smart roads would be highly expensive and the only way to pay for them would be the peoples money, and that seems almost impractical. These smart roads used electrical cables and magnets to help guide the car down the road, and with these ideas you would be putting the power into the roads not the cars. And with that these driverless cars would be much saver for everyone. But these roads could never be used for that they would take way too much money to be instaled, saying that driverless cars still remain unsafe.

Overall these cars would also be very hard to get llegalised. ¨Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers¨(9). Therefore, it is already hard enough to keep the drivers alert and watching the road while they are driving now, could you imagen how hard it would be to keep people alert when they have nothing to do? These laws are there to keep people safe and smart cars are the easy way to go not the safe way. Also, serious arguments would accure that would only cause problems not solve anything. Because what if this car gets into an accident while self-driving, would it be the drivers fault or the manufacture? Could you blame it on the driver and say they should have been more alert or say that the manufacture should have made/programed their cars better? These arguments and cases would be never ending, because almost all humans do not want to be saw as guilty so they would do and say anything to get off the hook. As to say, these smart driverless cars would do a lot more harm than help.

To justify my argument that everyone should be against the development of these driverless cars, just think about if it was you. These cars can not be pradictable and no one can be postive what will really happen. But what if it was you who got hurt or maybe a family memeber, because they let these unsafe and unperdicable cars out onto the roads. You would have no one to blame because it was just a machine or just a accendent. They are never meant to hurt but everyone would rather be safe than sorry. Make the right choice and do whats right to keep people safe, not to make their lives easier. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The elecotral college was a good solution many years ago to have a compromise between the election of President by Congress and to have the election of President by popular vote. Today, we have found flaws in the system.

To begin with, we fought many years to make voting right equal no matter your race, sex, or wealth. Shouldn't we keep that in mind, it would be more fair if everyone's individual vote counted. We shouln't have to let soemone vote for us. After we made this an equal country we should keep it that way.

In addition, some states have more people than others and if they only get a certain amount of voters not everyone really gets a say in the election. Therefor, if everyone gets their own vote the in the election the winner is truely who the citizens want to win. The number of electors can't make everybody in the state happy. Also, the ""My vote counted"" stickers you get after you vote aren't completly true in this system.

Next, we even have a name for what might happen... the disastor factor. You can't garuntee that the elector you vote for will elect who you want to really win. In this case you could elect oppent and not even realize it. If everyone's individual votes counted that would be solved, you know exactly who you are voting for.

In conclusion, the electoral college was a good idea many years ago. It made many years of voting easier but, now we see the flaws in it. The best way to elect the leader of our country is to have everyone have an equal vote.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"To the principal,

I think that the proposed policy could have either positive or negative effects, depending on the determination of my fellow students on playing school sports/other activities. To begin, students who are more determined towards playing school sports or other activities may decide to study harder in order to participate, improving their overall grade and making this new policy worthwhile. On the other hand, students may be against it because they do not want to put in the extra work to raise their grade, causing a lack of team members.

First of all, this policy could be an outright success if every student that both plays school sports or other school-related activities and has a C or lower grade average decides to step it up and gets better grades. If this would happen, it would overall, make the school brighter. However, I do not think this is very likely, as there would be, most likely, at least one student who does not want to give the extra effort to play school activities.

However, if little to no students believe they should have to work harder just to play school activities, then this could mean a problem. Because many students do not already qualify for this future-policy, the teams would therefore be much less populated, and this could possibly lead to the teams not having the required amount of members, and thus the students who already meet these requirements would also be punished unfairly. This could then lead to an absence of school sports, and then the activity levels of the students could drastically decrease.

Furthermore, the proposed policy, in my opinion, should be a good idea for the overall benefit of the school, because I believe that most students are willing to improve themselves, if nothing else, for the sake of engaging in school sports or otherwise school-related activities. This is because higher grades could mean grants, and grants could perhaps mean equipment for those sport-players or those who partake in school activities.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have been learning about the importance of self-reliance and how it can impact our lives. In my research, I have found that being self-reliant can have both advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to understand the benefits and drawbacks of relying on oneself versus others.

One of the main advantages of being self-reliant is that it allows individuals to make their own decisions and take control of their lives. This can lead to greater independence, confidence, and personal growth. Additionally, self-reliance can also lead to greater responsibility and accountability, as individuals must take ownership of their actions and decisions.

On the other hand, there are also disadvantages to being self-reliant. For example, relying solely on oneself can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, as individuals may not have the support and guidance of others. Additionally, relying solely on oneself can also lead to a lack of diversity in perspectives and ideas, as individuals may not have access to the knowledge and experiences of others.

One quote that relates to self-reliance is from basketball legend Michael Jordan, who said, ""Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen."" This quote highlights the importance of taking action and being proactive in achieving one's goals. By being self-reliant and making one's own decisions, individuals can take control of their lives and make things happen rather than waiting for things to happen to them.

In conclusion, being self-reliant can have both advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to understand the benefits and drawbacks of relying on oneself versus others. By being self-reliant, individuals can take control of their lives, make their own decisions, and achieve their goals. However, it is also important to recognize the value of having the support and guidance of others, and to be open to diverse perspectives and ideas.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

"As most of you may most likely know, whether it be through media or a friend, the 1976 Viking 1 spacecraft photographed what appeared to be a face in the Cydonia region on Mars. This so called face was created by shadows of rocks that made the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. In actuality, that's all this face is: an illusion. Many of us scientists are convinced that this ""Face on Mars"" is only just a mesa, although some of my fellow peers (as well as conspiracy theorists) are convinced that this face is a sign of alien life. In order to disprove the notion that the Face on Mars is in fact a sign of alien life, we (NASA) photographed the same mesa in the Cydonia region once more on April 5, 1998 using the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) which had a higher resolution camera than the Viking 1. This should have convinced the public and conspiracy theorists that the so called Face on Mars was only an illusion, as the photograph showed no face and only vague rocks and indents in the surface of the mesa, but no avail. They claimed that since it was cloudy when the picture was taken, it was covering up what the Face on Mars was supposedly hiding. So we set out to prove the conspiracy theorists wrong once and for all. On April 8, 2001 a final photograph was taken of the Face on Mars. This time, we used an even higher resolution camera (at 1.56 meters per pixel) on the MGS. What appeared was the exact same picture as we had taken in 1998. Alas, no one was satisfied and to this day conspiracy theorists still question that the Face on Mars is a mesa. Actually, the mesa that had the Face on Mars on it resembles many of the mesas we have here on Earth. As Garvin stated, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". Another piece of evidence for the face being a mesa is that in the 2 photos following the original in 1976, the face was no where to be seen. If th conspiracy theorists were right, than the MGS photographs would have shown a face and even alien symbols as some theorists claimed those would be some of the markings in the face. Unfortunately for them, all that showed up on the images were rocks and indents. In conclusion, base on all of the evidence gathered throughout 25 years about the Face on Mars, all evidence points to it being a mesa. From the illusion it created once, but never recreated to the resemblance of the Mesa to ones found here on Earth.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The fire tripled in size, and it had reached my ceiling before I knew it my whole kitchen was on fire. Here how it happened, I had asked my friend for advice on what should I do if the oil catches on fire. He told me to just pour water on it. The oil caught on fire, and I poured water on it, and you can guess what had happened, the fire tripled in size. Everyone agrees that we should always ask more than one person for advice, but sadly not everyone does it, and it can have daring consequences. I say that everyone should ask more than one person for advice because, it gives then more of a better understanding on the idea, you can see if someone is incorrect about the advice they gave you, and it is usually safer and better in general to ask for advice.

Asking more than one person for advice can give you a better understanding on the idea you are asking about, and it you can learn more. Lets say that for an example, you were asking about how to make your computer faster, and you learned new things about how a computer and how the parts of a computer work. For another example, you wanted to change your cars oil, but forgot which tube is the oil one. I ask someone for advice and know you know where the water or the liquid cooler goes just in case your car breaks down. For instance, you wanted to know where to put commas, so you ask for advice and after a couple of tries you now know where periods go instead of putting commas there. That is why it is better to ask more than one person for advice, because you can get a better understand of the idea and learn more.

Asking more than one person for advice is much better than just asking one person, because you can see if they are incorrect or not. For an example, I asked ten people if I can use eggs that have only been expired for a day. Everyone said no it is expired do not use it, except for one person who said it is okay to use, I was able to see that the one person that said it was okay most likely incorrect. For another instance, I asked my four of my friends if the mall is closed today, three of them said it is not closed, but one person said it is not closed yet. I can see that the person who said the mall is not closed yet is most likely wrong. Furthermore, I was not able to decide which car faster, so I can buy it for the race that is in two months, so I asked six of my friends for advice about which car is faster the BMW or Mercedes. five of them said the BMW but one of them said the Mercedes is faster, so that most likely means that the person who said the Mercedes is faster is incorrect.

Asking some people for advice instead of one person is better, because it is safer. For an example, I went to the doctor to see if I was sick, but the doctor said I was not sick, but I had showed symptoms of being sick, so I went to see two other doctors, and they both said I was sick, and I really was sick. For another instance, we were hiking in the woods when a venomous snake bite me. I urgently asked all of my friends for advice, one of my friends quickly advised me to suck the venom out, but the rest of my friends stopped me from doing it, and instead they put a really tight bandage around my leg. Now instead of losing my life I survived, because I had asked more than one person for advice. For the last example, I was modding a car, and I was going to buy a fake part, so I asked four of my friends about it. Three of my friends said do not buy it can make your car catch on fire, but one of my friends said it was okay. I did some research online and I had found out that the fake car part can actually make your car on fire.

Whoosh, the fire had tripled in size, and the whole kitchen had almost burned down. That all happened because I had asked only one person for advice instead of two or three or more. Before you do anything and you do not know exactly what to do, ask more than one person for advice it will be worth it in the long run. Asking more than one person for advice is much better because. you can get a better understanding of the idea and learn more, you can see who is incorrect, and it is much safer. That is why I state to always ask more than one person for advice.                          ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Many schools around the country design and assign summer projects for students to complete over the summer break. This is help students continue to learn and keep their brains active during summer break. Summer assignments also help students prepare for their incoming classes by learning concepts before the year starts. To better benefit the student, summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge of the course curriculum and many students need a teacher who can lead them through new concepts of the class.

Summer assignments are designed to help students maintain an active mind and prepare for their upcoming classes by learning course concepts before the school year starts. Teachers are trained for years to master the subject they are going to teach and mostly likely have already seen or learned the material in the class they are going teaching. Students do not know the course curriculum before they have taken the class. If the summer assignment was designed by the students, the assignment would not be as beneficially because students do not know what the curriculum of the class is.

For example, in classes I have always been give assignments created by my teachers. But, one class my teacher gave us an open ended project where students could create their own project using our ideas. All the kids in my class took weeks and even months to find an idea for their project. The students in my class had no idea what the teacher was looking for and how to correlate their ideas into the class curriculum. However, a teacher already knows the curriculum. This will allows for a more efficient and beneficial way of learning for the student because the teacher can create assignments they know is related to the course.

Not only do student not know the course concepts, students also do not have the skills to create assignments; students need a teacher leader to guide them through the new class. When learning a new concept, students can become overwhelmed if they do not understand the topics. At my school, some classes have very little guidance from teachers to help the students understand a new topic. My friends in these classes become very overwhelmed and become more apathetic to the class. Students do not understand how to learn a new without the guidance of a teacher. A teachers job is to create assignments, tests, and projects to lead their students towards mastering a concept. When teachers create assignments they are more involved with guiding their students. If summer assignments were student-designed there would be a lack of guidance compared to an assignment made from a teacher would have. This would causes students to inefficiently learn through summer assignments.

People who support student-designed summer assignments may argue that advanced placement (AP) classes require students to learn from textbooks without the guidance of a teacher so students do not need teacher guidance. But when taking a look at the students in these AP classes, on average students in AP classes struggle and receive poor grades in these classes. This is due to the lack of teacher leadership in these classes. Students in AP classes do not get enough guidance to fully understand the curriculum.

Summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge on the course curriculum and students need teacher guidance while learning new concepts. Summer assignments would be more effective if the teachers created the assignments themselves. Summer assignments that effectively teach students the curriculum over summer break will help benefit the students during the school year.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I think the Facial Action Coding System should be used to read how students are feeling because it would help teachers communicate with their students. The computer can see if the students are into the subject or are confused. This would make the computer help with troubled students by changing the work into a something easier than the previous work.

The amount of missing work would go down if the Facial Action Coding System were to be installed into students' computers. Like I said in the first paragraph, the computer would help students by giving them something that they would actually get. The struggle for students would be reduced with this \ technology.

Most students don't ask a teacher for help because they might not be feeling it and they would get behind. This is where the Facial Action Coding System would to play. The student who is emotionally frustrated or simply confused would be helped with easier problems on their work. I myself sometimes have problems like this and I think the technology would help me and other students.

Some students might not be comfortable with their face being scanned but after a while of receiving help they would realize that it is worth it. I believe that more students would show up to school if this technology were to be installed. They would see how much easier it is to learn by showing their expressions. It just might make them smile.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Deciding for Yourself

Making decisions is a big part of life. Whether it's what to wear in the morning or what college to go to after high school, we all have to make choices. But sometimes, people rely too much on experts to make decisions for them. I think it's important to make your own decisions instead of seeking guidance from others.

First of all, when you make your own decisions, you learn more about yourself. You figure out what you want and what's important to you. For example, if you're trying to decide what college to go to, you might talk to your parents and teachers about what they think, but in the end, it's your decision. If you choose a college that you're not really interested in, you might end up being unhappy there. But if you made the decision yourself, you'll be more likely to put in the effort to make it work.

Another reason is that experts might not always know what's best for you. Sure, they might have more experience and knowledge, but they don't know your personal preferences and goals like you do. For example, if you're trying to decide what career to pursue, an expert might tell you that being a doctor is a good choice because it's well-paying and prestigious. But if you're not really interested in medicine, you might end up hating your job and feeling like you've wasted your time.

Finally, making your own decisions can be a great learning experience. When you have to think through the pros and cons of a decision and come to a conclusion on your own, you develop important skills like critical thinking and problem-solving. You learn how to weigh the evidence and make a decision based on what's most important to you. These skills will help you in all areas of life, not just making decisions.

Of course, it's okay to ask for advice from others sometimes. Everyone could use a second opinion or some fresh ideas. But ultimately, the decision should be yours. When you make your own decisions, you take ownership of your life and your choices. You're more",1,llama2_chat,3
the author supports his idea well because there could be fossiles we never even knew exsited on venus and they say that venus is the closest twin to earth so its worth a shot right? honestly we should because what if they discover that venus was like earth and it just changed and killed everything else off and all the oceans and seas evaporated and thats why theres such a thick cloud above it. i honestly think that they should try because what if venus was like earth and there were other types of life forms on there that werent human it could be ground breaking and what if earth is headed to turning out to be like venus. and if we do find fossils and other things to indicate that there was life on venus and it just all died off because of the heat. we could learn how to prevent it happening to earth with future generations. ,0,persuade_corpus,3
"Limiting car usage can put a new perspective in your life. Limiting car usage can be a huge benefit because first of all, you'll have better health. This even goes out to the healthiest people in this world. Secondly, Global Warming will be less harsh and dangerous to all the living creeatures of the world. Lastly, you can be more open and associate with many people. Limiting car usage is probably the best idea to reduce all the hazards and bad things on Earth.

To begin with, I want to inform you that car usage has become worse and worse over the years. Our health is in jeopardy because of how much we use cars. But with limiting car usage around the globe anyone can become a healthier person. A great percent of our population in th United States are overweight or obese. Even all over the globe! With limiting how much time we use cars we can reduce that percent and become healthier people because that way we can walk to our places and not just sit down in a car doing absolutely nothing. People have become much happier in limmiting their car usage. Those people go out and get fresh air and not sit in a car going from place to place. And with being much happier has come less stress. People who are too stressed are not to happy that's why its better not using a car just to go grocery shopping. You wouldn't have to worry about the lights and stop signs or be scared if your going to be in a car accident. The only time you should be able to use a car is going long distances and places like other cities.

To move foward, Global Warming has become a really big issue for us. All the pollution that Planet Earth gets from cars is absurd! Cars release so much gas and harmful substances that we breathe in. It doesnt only affect us but animal too and all living things. Now the smog has gotten way worse. Paris has a huge percent of smog covering the city that even France has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. Congestion has gone down to 60 percent. Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted city in the world. Now everywhere you go even if its really cold nights arent as cold as they used to be. Cold nights and warm days have caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

Another thing about limiting car usage is that you can even associate with other people around you. Just walking to you local market or a food restaurant you are probably say hello to different people some even communicating with them. You can walk to parks or go walk to a nearest pool or beach and I gaurantee you that you're going to be talking to many different people throughtout the day. You can use alternative transportation such as bus, bikes, scooters and let me tell you being in bikes and scooters is a lot more fun a relaxing then driving a car or being in one. Walking and hiking around is a huge relieve of stress.

Hence, limiting car usage is a big improvement for us it will help us in so many ways. Such as, we can improve our health and we could be so much better because a great percent of this world is either overweight or obese and limiting cars can help you go out and walk or even bikes can get you where you want to go and thats a form of exercise. Global Warming has been on the rise. It's been rising and rising and limiting how much we use cars can absolutley help with it by lowering the pollution the temperatures may not be so hot you wont feel like your boiling just walking outside your front door. You can associate with many different people throughout your day even if it's just a simple hello. Walking to grocery stores and restaurants can make you feel a whole lot better and relieve your stress and also communicate with other people. We all need to put a limit in everything good or bad, so lets start doing it now!    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I think all students shouldn't have to do community service hours. I think if some of the students want to do the community service hours then they could volunteer for it. For example, the students who want to do community service hours could sign up in the offices, library, classes, etc. Not all students should have to do the community service hours because some of us have things to do after school, at home, or maybe we have to be places that are very important. Some of the students who wouldn't want to do community service hours maybe want to go home and relax, clean up around the house, or spend time with their family. It's not that the students that don't volunteer don't want to do community service hours just because, there's always a reason for it. The students who do want to do the community service hours, should maybe get a reward for helping out with our community and the people in it. If the principal wants for all the students to do community service hours, then maybe they could find a way to take a little time from school. if not that, then I don't think all the students would do community service hours. I'm sure that most if the students will agree with this opinion, and some other students may not. Maybe another way to do community service hours if all students will have to, is the classes could go on field trips to places that need community service, if not that at the most, then at the least the students who have gym classes could go outside and clean up around the school area and earn their community service hours that way. helping our community is very important, but not all students will agree to doing it for whatever reason they have. I think the students shouldn't be forced into doing community service hours.",0,persuade_corpus,2

"I personally believe that driverless cars are a good idea and can be very useful. There are also some major points that are needed to be pointed out before a person purchases or drives one of these cars. I can see people taking advantage of these technologies and abusing the things the car may provide. The buyer should always take into consideration that these car could malfunction and be aware that these cars are not always going to be reliable.

If the driver were to be carless and text and drive the car could possibly malfunction and you could be putting your life or someone else's life at risk.

Manufactors are coming up with new techniques to help alert the driver of any danger that could possibly occur before the incident could even happen. Vibrating seats are providing the driver enough time to stop the car when it is about to run into another object. Flashing lights on the dash board are used to alert the driver if the car thinks they are being distracted from the road. In these cars the manufactors are installing video cameras to watch the driver inside that car and to watch for any danger the driver might encounter outside of the car. GPS are installed to monitor where the car is in case of a crash or if the driver is lost on the road the driver can use it to find there destination. Motion sensors are being put into cars to help the driver drive safely. The motion sensors help the driver know how far away they are from hitting another car or even a person. They are also used to apply brakes when the car is coming to close to another object. They are hoping to soon put in a display where the driverless car system can be shut off when the driver wants to be in control. ""The car read the positive and negative factors in binary code, they functioned surprisingly well but to make the massive upgrades needed would be far to expensive for them to even make it practical.""

The main focus that these manufactors have is to keep everyone on the roads safe. Take this into consideration, these cars could possibly change the human way of driving. Each and everyday new technologies are being discovered and giving humans another reason to become more lazy. These developments will eventually come into good use when the time comes, but that is if the people using them will have enough common sense to understand they can not abuse the advantages these cars provide and if they do it could lead into bigger consequenses.

"When students have summer projects, the question comes up of whether they should be teacher-designed or students-designed projects. For the benefit of the student the summer projects should be teacher designed because it can help you retain some of the information you learned from the previous year, it can prepare for what a you could expect next year, and the teacher can make parts of the project based on topics that you may not be as strong in.

First off when it comes to summer projects, it is true that students tend to put them off and focus on having fun. This causes students to lose some of the knowledge that they gained throughout the previous year. So when the student decides to do the summer project that's when they begin to regain the knowledge because they start using the brain to find information on the topic at hand or answer any questions that are asked. Doing this can help the student retain the information by linking it with a certain activity such as the summer project. I know that when I had summer projects to do by the time school started I remebered most of what I learned from the project so when school started i dint need to review anything cause I already remebered it from the project.

Another benefit of having teacher-designed summer projects is that they can prepare you for the upcoming year. Teachers know what one should expect for the coming years so they can properlly prepare you for what you should be seeing in the next school year. It does make sense that if a summer project was student- designed it would have a higher chance of getting finished, it would be do to the fact that students would make it easy and it'll cause them to not retain the information. So when teacher-designed summer project gets assigned you'll be forced to research what you will be learning so it can aid you with aquiring an understanding of what you'll be seeing later. This can make you better as a student and it can get your mind right and ready to start school.

Since teachers know what you should expect for the upcoming school year and doinga summer project helps you retain information this can give the teacher the option to make the project based on topics that you aren't as strong in so when the year comes up you'll have a good understanding of it. Especially when you are continuing on to a higher level of a previous class it is important to have the informtaion from last year locked in to your head so you don't fall behind. An example of this is when I got assigned a summer project based on the units of history that I didn't do well in so the teacher gave me a summer project so next year I have a good grasp on what I learned.

In conclusion, It would be best if students got assigned a teacher-designed project because they know what would help you and what you'll expect to see next year so they can properlly prepare you for what you'll see. So all around a teacher-designed project is the most beneficial.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that seeking guidance is essential in order to achieve success in all aspects of life. Whether it is in school, work, or personal life, guidance can help reduce stress, learn new skills, cure depression, save time, and make life easier. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of seeking guidance and provide examples of how it has helped me in my own life.

Firstly, seeking guidance can help reduce stress. In today's fast-paced world, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed and stressed. Guidance can provide a sense of direction and help individuals navigate through difficult situations. For example, when I was struggling with my school work, I sought guidance from my teacher. She provided me with additional resources and strategies to help me better understand the material. As a result, I was able to reduce my stress levels and improve my grades.

Secondly, seeking guidance can help individuals learn new skills. Whether it is a new hobby or a new career, guidance can provide individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed. For example, when I was interested in learning how to code, I sought guidance from a computer science teacher. He provided me with a step-by-step guide to learning the basics of coding. As a result, I was able to learn a new skill and potentially open up new career opportunities.

Thirdly, seeking guidance can help cure depression. Depression is a serious mental health issue that can affect individuals of all ages. Guidance can provide individuals with the support and resources necessary to overcome depression. For example, when I was struggling with depression, I sought guidance from a counselor. She provided me with coping mechanisms and helped me work through my feelings. As a result, I was able to overcome my depression and improve my overall well-being.

Fourthly, seeking guidance can save time. When faced with a difficult task or decision, individuals may spend countless hours trying to figure it out on their own. Guidance can provide individuals with the knowledge and resources necessary to complete the task or make the decision more efficiently. For example, when I was struggling with a math problem, I sought guidance from a tutor. She provided me with a clear explanation of the problem and helped me work through it step-by-step. As a result, I was able to save time and improve my understanding of the",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

So why dont you belive us if you lok colsely at the 1998 picture you can clearly see no alien markings but yet you still belive why. Every body else belives us why cant you all you we see is a big rock so why do you think aliens put it there.

In the article it clearly states that the so called face was not made by aliens but just natural formations. There is no life what so ever on mars. It was not made by aliens but instead by mother nature. It was found in cydonia where a lot of other mesas located there and if that is not proof enough we sent three misions and they all reported it was a mesa nothing more nothing less. Unfortunatly some scientists belived it was an alien artifact so we took more pictures and the showed the exact same thing.

But we sent another mission to take pictures with more pixels and they showed no proof of alien life. But you still dont belive us and I dont understand why you dont belive us. even though we gave you all this proof you dont seem to care. What will it take to convince you that its not a face. If I were you i would have belived NASA as soon as they showed the picture.

But I am not you so

I will try to convince you. But if you reject the idea I will not care.

I will simply leave . So I will. continue when they told the public they even said it was a natural thing but still . the face is not really made by aliens but it is naturaly awsome. so i will leave telling you that you are wrong and that NASA is right. but the face is still cool and if it broke off and fell to earth it would be alien so food for thought.

"Technology has become an integral part of our lives in recent years. From smartphones to smart homes, it has transformed the way we live, work, and interact with others. While there are many benefits to technology, there are also some negative effects that we cannot ignore.

One of the most significant benefits of technology is the way it has revolutionized communication. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, we can now connect with people from all over the world in real-time. This has made it easier for us to maintain relationships with friends and family, as well as to collaborate with others in the workplace.

Another benefit of technology is the way it has made our lives more convenient. With smartphones and other mobile devices, we can access information and services from anywhere, at any time. This has made it easier for us to shop, bank, and even get medical care.

However, there are also some negative effects of technology that we cannot ignore. One of the biggest concerns is the impact of technology on our mental health. Studies have shown that excessive use of social media and other digital devices can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. This is because technology can create a false sense of connection, making us feel like we are constantly comparing ourselves to others and feeling inadequate.

Another negative effect of technology is the way it has changed our attention spans. With so much information available at our fingertips, it can be difficult to focus on one task for an extended period of time. This can lead to decreased productivity and a lack of focus in our daily lives.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on our lives. While there are many benefits to using technology, there are also some negative effects that we cannot ignore. It is important for us to be aware of these effects and to use technology in a responsible and balanced way. By doing so, we can maximize the benefits of technology while minimizing its negative effects on our lives.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to understand the different activities offered at the school and how they can help us to better understand our interests and abilities in comparison to others. Participating in a school activity can provide us with numerous benefits, including the opportunity to make new friends, receive a college degree, learn new things, and improve our future prospects.

One of the most significant benefits of participating in a school activity is the opportunity to make new friends. By joining a club or team, we can meet people who share our interests and passions. This can help us to form lasting friendships and expand our social circle. Additionally, by working together with our peers, we can learn from each other and gain valuable communication and teamwork skills.

Another benefit of participating in a school activity is the potential to receive a college degree. Many colleges and universities offer scholarships and grants for students who participate in extracurricular activities. By demonstrating a commitment to a particular activity, we can show colleges and universities that we are well-rounded individuals with a range of skills and interests. This can help us to stand out in the college application process and increase our chances of receiving financial aid.

In addition to making new friends and improving our chances of receiving a college degree, participating in a school activity can also help us to learn new things and improve our skills. Whether we join a sports team, a club, or a volunteer organization, we can gain valuable experience and knowledge that can help us to succeed in the future. For example, by joining a science club, we can learn about new scientific concepts and experiments. By joining a debate team, we can improve our public speaking and critical thinking skills.

Finally, participating in a school activity can help us to better our future prospects. By developing a range of skills and interests, we can increase our employability and career opportunities. For example, by joining a business club, we can learn about entrepreneurship and business management. By joining a music or theater club, we can develop our artistic skills and increase our chances of pursuing a career in the arts.

In conclusion, participating in a school activity can provide us with numerous benefits, including the opportunity to make new friends, receive a college degree, learn new things, and improve our future prospects.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that all students should be required to have a certain amount of community service. This could consist of helping out teachers after school, picking up trash at local parks, and even helping out with non-profit community events. However, the key to this institution would be that the students don't get paid.

In these times, I personally think that kids have too much money. Whether it comes from an allowance, or a gift, the students get too much undeserved money. I do understand that some kids work for there money, but they need to learn what service is, and the other kind of payment that you get from it. I myself have participated in many service projects, and over the years I have found that I get a sense of accomplishment that you get with nothing else that you do. This is what I mean by the ""other"" kind of payment. When you get money, even if you have worked for it, you just are happy about the profit that you have gained, and all you think about is what you could possibly spend it on. By doing service, you feel that you have helped someone with something that they could not have done without you. This could help to increase thoughts of self-worth, and self-esteem. Then that could lead to better concentration, and better focus on school work, and the things that are most important in life.

Service could also provide a good distraction from other things. If students have something good to do, and they realize that it makes them feel good about themselves, they will most likely stay away from other things. For instance drugs, parties that may have bad activities, and other dishonorable endeavors. In fact, service can almost be like a drug itself. Although a good drug, it can give you a high of self-confidence. This can then lead to an addiction where the victim would continue wanting to do it so that they could feel that way again. In all, service can act as a good distraction from other harmful things.

Another reason that service is good is because it will teach students skills that they may need later in life. For instance, I have participated in many service projects regarding service including building shelves in a concession stand, painting, building fences, and even bridges. All of these are skills that I may use, and maybe even need later in life. There is no doubt that service can teach students life skills, and lessons.

In all I think that service is a very important part of the growth, and development of not only our local school students, but of this entire nation. Service can lead to success in many fields, and we need to experience it to become successful, honest, and independent adults.

"Summer projects help the students learn during the summer and become prepared for the next school year. Although some may say teachers are more experienced at giving projects because they have been doing it longer; Summer projects should be student-designed, because students will probably not be in that same class with the same teacher next school year, it will be more enjoyed by students, and student are on there break from school and still have to do school work.

First, the students will enjoy the summer project more because the students picked it. The students would also put more work and effort in to the project because it can be about someone admired by the student(s) or can be a career choice in the future. Students would be able to do a project on sports, history, engineering, animals, and even health of the human body. There would be interest in the project with that students do not have to do the repeated subject that is in class or a boring assignment the teacher does not care about. When students enjoy a project the subject and possibilities can be limitless and full of imagination.

Secondly, if a teacher gives a summer project to the students nine out of ten of the students will not be in the same class next school year unless the class was an elective class and the students(s) chose to do it again. While having a different teacher next school year the project may or may not be cared for because of the subject difference and the teacher is not worried about what another teacher is teaching. Furthermore, the project may not even be graded by the new teacher so the student should have a project that can related or help them out of the school community. Also the project should be something the student can do without needing teacher assistance in case that the prompt of the project is not clear or the student has trouble finding information on the project.

Last but not the least, during the summer students have a break to relax from all the things students do in school. The students already have to do a project that would be preferred not to do ,so instead of having a teacher design the project having a project that can benefit the students will help them in every day life. Most students take vacations during summer time so having a project that is designed by students can give them ideas on what to do on vacation. The students would have a guide or set up exactly the way the students want it and model the project with out frustration.

In conclusion, If a student is forced to do a teacher designed project the students will be helpless, misled, and extremely bored during the summer. A project made by students can be enjoyed while also educating and preparing the student for the future while having a amazing summer. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear state senator,

I think that they should change the election way of how they are doing it. I think that the president should be chosen by the most popular vote. i aslo think that they shouldnt do the voting thing if they are gunna end up chooseing it them selfes. in the passage it said that, the electoral college is made up of 538 electors and only the majority vote is 270. So i dont understand why they thousand of people to vote if their vote doesnt really mater its what senators choose overall. i think it would be fair if what the peple choose the most shall win. What if one of them gets more votes and the senator picks the other because they had more votes in there group, thats not fair. i just think that the overall vote of the people should count, and not make them wast there time. it also says in the article when you vote for you candidate you actuall voting for the candidates elector, so they are trying to trick them into thinking that there votw would count. what if the persident that the senator choose didnt know how to work stuff and had bad disitions, the election is every four years on a tuesday on a november. thats a pretty long time if you ask me. I think that half of the people votes dont cont cause of the sentors that choose. i know it would be long to count everones vote but i dont think it matters because in the end it would be chosen by the people that wanted that president not what the senators wanted.

I think they should keep the Electoral college because what's the need of changing it if it was the same way back in the day. I could be wrong but i also think many things shouldn't change like trying something different whether it's new or not. many things shouldn't change just because it feels right or it may help with your problems because 9 times out of 10 it may go all wrong when you try it but all worked out in your head perfectly. The electoral college consists of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. the electoral college consists of 538 electors but a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. And in my own personal opinion i think there's absoulutely nothing wrong with the electoral college i think it gives good advice and helps motivates you. the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates  to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. I sometimes think many people are aganist electoral college because the way it seperates the votes and only half will be required to go to the election and be seen. And others may have their opinions on this but it's ok to have your own opinion also different opinions don't hurt nobody it's just that different people believe in different things.    ,0,persuade_corpus,0
"In Koea, there is a old saying that says ""Don't catch the fish for the kids, but teach them how to catch it."" It means challenging itself is the only way to improve and it is better for people to learn for themselves instead of getting help on everything from other people. Some schools reuquire summer project for students during the break. Some teachers design the projects for their students, but some let their students to design them. Hoever, the summer projects should be student-designed for students' creativity and remembering the content.

First, the summer projects should be student-designed because it helps the students to improve their creativity. When students design their own unique project, they have to come up with personal idea to imply on the project. Since they need their own idea, students have to think more about the theme, content, type of project, and all the things that they might want to put in the project. This process helps the students to think a lot deeper than teachers giving specific directions which helps to improve their creativity.

Second, the summer projects should be student-designed becuase it helps the students to remember the learnings. When students design their own project, they need to remember and understand what they have learned during the school year well enough to evaluate into a project. It requires them to think about the contents for a long time and go through the notes or text books for informations. This process helps the students to reorganize the informations in their brain which eventually allows them to have longer memory on the learnings.

However, even though student-designed summer projects help students to improve creativity and remember the content, there might be people who does not agree with this statement. Some might say that it takes too much time and effort to design the projects themselves and summer break is the time for the students to rest, spend time with their own family members and friends, and use their effort on extracurricular activities. However, they can arrange their schedule to make time for the projects and they can decide whether to make the project big or small. Other may argue that students might have hard time doing the project since it is not instructed. However, it is true that people improve and grow when they challenge themselves. It is better to have challenge for the students, which is the self-designed project. Also, since the students can design the project, they can design it to their own aility.

Since it helps the students to improve their creativity and helps them to remember the lessons better, the summer projects should be student-designed. Challenging themselves is the only way for them to improve and have more experience. It is the better way of learning.                   ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The Electoral college is a way of voting for Presidency. Electors are the people who consist of that. Their are 538 electors. A majority of the 270 votes is required to elect a president, The 23rd amendment of the constitution states that 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. The candidate's political party generally choose the electors. The Presidential election is held every 4 years on the tuesdaay after the first monday in november. Most of the states have a winner takes all system except Nebraska and maine. After the presidental election, the governer prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"".

These are Cons about electoral college .Voters dont vote for a president,But for a state elector. The disaster factor is the best argument against the electoral college. The electoral college is irrational,outdated and unfair, And the arguments have pros that are assertions without basis in reality. The Electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense. The electoral college is also a anachronism. The Electoral colloge is a process that is full wit pros and it also has its small and enormous cons.                                                     ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Hey there!  So, I'm gonna write this essay about Emerson's quote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already done, you are not going to find out what you are capable of."" 

First off, I totally agree with Emerson because, like, if you don't push yourself to do new things, you'll never know how awesome you can be.  For instance, I used to be really into drawing, but I never thought I could actually paint. So, I took a risk and tried it out, and it turned out to be super fun!  Now, I'm actually pretty good at it. 

Another reason I agree with Emerson is that, if you don't try new things, you'll miss out on so many opportunities. Like, there are so many cool clubs and activities in school, but I never tried them out because I thought I wouldn't be good at them.  But then, I saw some of my friends having a blast at a club meeting, and I was like, ""Dang, I'm missing out!""  So, I decided to give it a shot, and now I'm the president of the club!  It's been super fun and has taught me so much. 

Lastly, trying something beyond what you have already done can help you discover your true potential. Like, I never thought I could be a good public speaker, but then I had to give a presentation in front of the whole class, and it turned out to be way easier than I thought!  Now, I'm actually pretty confident in my speaking skills, and I'm even thinking about joining the debate team. 

So, the impact of trying something beyond what you have already done is that it can help you find out what you're truly capable of, open up new opportunities, and help you discover your true potential.  It's like, if you don't take risks and try new things, you'll never know what you're missing out on.",1,llama2_chat,3
"I feel that we should not have driverless cars. They could malfunction while someone is riding and cause an accident. There are also a lot of flaws to them. I also feel that most people wouldn't be able to afford them and then companies are wasting money. Why would a company make something that won't sell very well?

As I said, they could malfunction while someone is driving. A wire could be loose or the sensors could stop at any time. The car may not even be able to tell you that there are issues if there is a problem on the main circuit. What would happen if I hit somebody because my sensors stopped working? In the article it said that they are not sure if the blame is on the driver or the company. To me that's unfair, I wouldn't purposely hit somebody. There are too many flaws to this idea and even more could occur down the road. It's too unsafe and multiple disasters are more than likely to occur.

These cars would also cost a lot of money. In today's economy, a lot of people are struggling to even get jobs. They wouldn't waste money on something they don't need. They have a car that they can drive themselves, that's more safe. People would also have to pay for gas and probably have to get it checked out for multiple reasons. How much would all of it cost?

Overall I feel it could be helpful in some ways but would you really trust a driverless vehicle? You wouldn't just send your kids in a car with no driver. It doesn't seem very safe and I feel that there are too many flaws. I wouldn't continue developing them for cost reasons and safety issues. Once you fix one flaw, you are more than likely to just find another. This is why I feel we should quit developing driverless cars.              ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"First impressions are the initial thoughts and feelings that a person has about another person. They are formed within seconds of meeting someone and can greatly influence the way people interact with each other. First impressions can be used to reflect someone's personality in various ways.

One way first impressions can reflect someone's personality is through their appearance. For example, if a person is dressed in a clean and well-fitting suit, they may be perceived as confident and professional. On the other hand, if a person is wearing dirty clothes and has unkempt hair, they may be perceived as careless and unprofessional.

Another way first impressions can reflect someone's personality is through their behavior and attitude. For example, if a person is smiling, making eye contact, and showing interest in the conversation, they may be perceived as friendly and approachable. On the other hand, if a person is frowning, avoiding eye contact, and appearing distant, they may be perceived as unfriendly and unapproachable.

First impressions can also have a lasting impact on relationships. For example, if someone makes a negative first impression on a potential friend or colleague, they may struggle to form a positive relationship with that person in the future. On the other hand, if someone makes a positive first impression, they may be more likely to form a strong and lasting relationship with that person.

Kindness and respect for others can also help form positive first impressions. When a person is kind and respectful towards others, they may be perceived as compassionate and empathetic. This can lead to a positive first impression and may make it easier for that person to form strong relationships with others.

However, it is important to note that first impressions can be impossible to change. Once a person has formed an initial opinion about someone, it can be difficult to change that opinion. This is because first impressions are based on limited information and can be influenced by factors such as the person's appearance, behavior, and attitude.

In conclusion, first impressions can greatly influence the way people interact with each other. They can reflect someone's personality through their appearance, behavior, and attitude. First impressions can also have a lasting impact on relationships and can be shaped by kindness and respect for others. While first impressions can be difficult to change, it is important to be aware of them and strive to",1,llammistral7binstruct,4

"Summer can be an issue when it comes to students' abilities of retaining knowledge from the prior school year. Summer assignments are designed to help students sharpen their learning skills over the summer in order to help them thrive in the coming academic school year. One question to consider is whether these summer assignments would be more beneficial if designed by students rather than teachers, or if they should be designed by teachers rather than students. Although some argue that these assignments should be designed by students, teacher-designed assignments would be more beneficial as they would introduce the skills needed to be successful, incorporate curriculum to help students have an understanding of the course before school starts, and ensure that students are correctly preparing themselves for school.

When designing summer assignments, it is important that skills such as reading comprehension, argumentative writing, and creative thinking are reintroduced to help students refresh their memory on how to perform certain tasks to the best of their abilities. Teachers would be able to introduce those skills in the best possible ways, as they are the ones teaching the course and have a better understanding of the skills needed to be successful in the class. If students were to design the summer assignments, their own thoughts on the skills they think they need for the course are not as reliable as the teachers beliefs. Therefore, they would not be enhancing the skills they need for the course, which would make it harder to be successful in the class from the start. Teachers also have much more experience in establishing ways to improve upon these skills. Teacher-designed summer assignments would be the most reliable when it comes to specific ways of introducing skills needed in order to excel because teachers understand the qualities needed to advance in the curriculum.

Also, teacher-designed summer assignments would be the best to ensure that students can obtain prior knowledge of what the course they are going to take will include. Teachers would already have experience on the curriculum and know exactly what to include when designing the task. Students are blind to specific learning standards of the course, therefore, they would not know what to include in order to help them establish background knowledge on the subject. The best way to start off a class is with a general understanding of the purpose of the course and some knowledge on the curriculum. Teachers would be able to include that into the summer assignment to ensure that students can start off the year with a good understanding, which would help them be more likely to succeed. A teacher-designed summer assignment is much more beneficial than a student-designed assignment because teachers would already have examined the curriculum to ensure that students understand the subject before the academic school year begins.

A counter to the prior arguments is that some believe a student-designed summer assignment would be more beneficial than a teacher-designed assignment. If students were able to design their own summer tasks, they would be able to include their own creative aspect to learning and retouching on their skills. Teachers would be able to see the qualities and capabilities of each individual student to help them have an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. However, although it is good that students can add their own creativity to the task, it does not ensure that students are correctly preparing themselves for the coming year. A student-designed assignment may not include all the necessary learning standards needed for a course such as ways to enhance skills and background knowledge on the curriculum. Therefore, student-designed summer assignments are not even close to the benefits a students would receive from being given a teacher-designed summer assignment.

Teacher-designed summer assignments are best to ensure that students continue learning to the best of their abilities. They would be able to retouch and improve upon certain skills, have a general understanding of the course, and be certain that they are properly preparing themselves for the coming school year. This coming summer, students should rely on a teacher-designed summer assignment to ensure that students can be the best academic scholars they can be in order to have a successful school year. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Senator,

I heartily agree that we the people should keep the Electroral College. Like you may already know, ""the ElectoralCcollege is a process, not a place."" Our founding fathers have made it, and as we look back into history, we realize that they were right about how a lot of things run in the U.S., so why should we question them now? Even we too as citizens know that they were right for making the Electoral College. As much as we aren't a citizen- ruled society, we aren't a totalitarian society either.

A really good reason for having the Electoral College is simply recognizefd by saying that it kind of gives us(the citizns of America) the ""power"" to vote for our president, rather than it being inherited, or voted upon solely by government officials, or some ranom process like in North Korea where Kim Jung Uun gets voted because he basically brainwashed his people into loving him. It gives us a certainty that we can chose the betterment for America. Also, though roughly half of the U.S. might agree, and the other half might disagree, you are entitled to your own opinion, and voting gives you the chance to show your opinion about whom you believe should be able to run our beatiful homeland as our trusted founding fathers once did, as presidnet.

I'm sure that it has come to you that their are, in fact, several great reasons for allowing the Electoral college still run, but their is a couple of downsides. First off, the people within the Electoral College that vote for us citizens, don't vote for each individual person, they vote based upon who is voted the most in their relative area in whichever state their in, so the people don't all get their votes out. This could have turned several presidential elctions around and helped the man or woman that lost in the election to win it.

After seeing the great pro's and the tiny con's, I'm sure your settled upon the opinion of holding on to the Electoral College,though you are entitled to your own opinion, you can't deny the facts.

Yours truly,

"Do you think students will have time to do at lest one extracurricular activity after reading this? Doing an extracurricular activity might not always bring good things to students. This can affect students in a lot of ways with other things they do after school. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might not have time, they can have other activities after school, and students can get stressed and tired.

To begin with, one reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might not have time. Students will not have time to do their homework after school. They might not have time to finish a project they been signed or to study for a test. Students will not have time to go out and hang out with their friends or spend time with their families. For example, students will not have time to eat dinner with their families.

Next, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might already do other activities after school. Students might already participate in after school sport but no play a school sport. If students are 15 years or older they can start working and some students might want a easy after school job. They probably want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school. For example, take dance classes or instrument classes.

In addition, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can get stressed and tired. If students get stressed their grades can go down and their parents can get mad. Students can get tired and sleepy in class and teachers will keep on saying, ""keep your head up"" during class. It will be hard for students to keep up with their work in class for example, they will not finish on time.

Finally, students will not have time to finish their homework or projects they have and no time to be will their families and friends. They will want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school like other classes. If students do get into a extracurricular activity they can get stressed or tired and their grades might go down.

"Using technology to read students' emotional expressions is a very bright idea. Using this type of technology in the classrooms could get out of hand, but I believe it would extremely useful. All it takes is a little time to get use to then it would be a huge help. When working on assignments during class on the computers, or being assigned a video, the computer would be able to read our emotions and try to put a twist into the lesson, and not just any twist, it would help the students catch onto the lesson and learn from the activity. I believe that the Facial Act Coding System would be a great help, especially for teachers use.

When learning something new in class it can be a bit boring. Especially when reading articles on the computer or even watching videos. Students fall asleep or even get on their phones. Even if the teacher hands out guides during the videos, no one can catch on and keep their minds on the video. Teachers try to find the videos that give good lessons, but are also attention grabbers. In the article Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

I believe that this technology would be extremely valuable and could possibly even bring students grades up. Even if it was just a little assignment here and there, the computer could recognize the boredem and help with the lesson. I feel as if students would concentrate more often and actually be doing good in class if the FACS would be set up on school computers.

Teachers I believe would want look into this technology, it could even help the kids remember more and do better on test. Test are always a big chunk of your grade and not everyone does their best, but with this technology it can help students remember information and actually keep the information well known in their minds.

"Online classes vs. in-person classes: which one is better?

As an 8th grader, I have experienced both online classes and in-person classes, and I have to say that there are some pretty big differences between the two. One of the biggest differences is the way students pay attention in class. When I'm taking an online class, I can easily get distracted by my phone or computer, and before I know it, I've been scrolling through social media for half an hour. It's way harder to stay focused in an online class than it is in a traditional classroom.

On the other hand, when I'm in a class with a teacher, I feel more engaged and motivated. I can ask questions and get help right away, and I can see the teacher's facial expressions and body language, which helps me understand what they're trying to convey. Plus, I can learn from my classmates and get a better sense of the material through their questions and discussions.

Another big difference is the effectiveness of communication. In an online class, it can be hard to communicate with the teacher or other students if I have a question or need help. I might have to wait for a response, or I might not get one at all. In a traditional classroom, I can ask a question right away and get an answer immediately. Plus, I can see the teacher's face and body language, which helps me understand what they're trying to say.

Access to resources is another thing to consider. In an online class, I might not have access to all the resources I need, like textbooks or other materials. But in a traditional classroom, I can easily access all the resources I need, like textbooks, notebooks, and pencils.

Finally, I think the overall ability to learn in each setting is different. In an online class, I might feel more isolated and disconnected from the material. But in a traditional classroom, I feel more connected to the material and my classmates, and I'm more likely to learn and retain the information.

In conclusion, while both online classes and in-person classes have their advantages, I think the overall ability to learn and stay focused is better in a traditional classroom. With the help of a teacher and my classmates,",1,llama2_chat,3

If that piece of machinery fails while on the road the driver is required to take control of the car to keep it from driving into any people, buildings, or other cars. In all of the situations above the driver would need to take control of that unique situation, or else fatalities could occur. These are only a couple examples of what could happen if a driverless car malfunctioned while on the road.

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it says that the current taxi system would be taken over by driverless cars. this would put hundreds of thousands of taxi and Uber drivers out of a job. There are also some jobs that cannot be replaced by driverless cars. A job like the trash collector would require the driver to get into the driveway, and get in the correct position to properly and safely collect the trash. Emergerency response vehicles like ambulances, police cars, and fire trucks would also need drivers to get them through traffic quickly, efficiantly, and safely. These examples show that hundreds of thousands of people would lose their jobs if driverless cars were to take over. They also show that some jobs can not be completed without a driver behind the wheel.

Since, driverless cars are driven by computers that means they are suseptable to hackers or other harmful people. If a driverless car has a computer that is connected to the internet hackers anywhere in the world could hack into the car's computer, and make it do whatever they want. There are also people who could damage the car physically by damaging essential external parts of the car. There are also unforseen events that could happen through nature. The car's camera or LIDAR could be covered up acciddently by a leaf or a bug. The car could hit a bad bump and jar the sytems computer. These are things that are possible in the realm of driverless cars.

These reasons that I have stated show that there will always be a time when cars will need a driver to take control of a unique situation. Whether it be a faulty computer or broken camera; drivers will always be needed.  ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"there are many thing in life people want and need such as money, families and fame. but what people dont understand is that most of what they want is stuff they dont need and they would be better off without it. cars are beginning to be something people dont need. all it is doing is causing more problems then solutions. Major people are starting to notice,presidents and governements, and are  acting apon it. limiting car usage would bring a lot of advavtages such as more pocket money, more excrises and less harm to the earth acorrding to Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota by Andrew Selsky, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer and the end of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Cars are defined as a motor vecheil that provides fast transportation for more then one person at a time. thats what most people veiw it as, what that dont know and relize is that it give people a lot more stress to deal with because of either car payments, repairs, or even runing out of gas.  acorrding to Heidrun Walter in the passage in german suburb, life goes on without cars she said that when she had a car she was always tense and now that she doesnt have a car sge is more relaxed and is better off without it. she doesnt have to pay for insurance, car payments, repairs on the car and not even gas. that will leave her with a lot of stress free moments.

cars do not only stress out people but they are pulloting the earth. almost all cars run on gas which is put in the car and releases pullotion into the earth. paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of pullotion.... that is how much damage it is doing to the earth. it took five days the smog finally rivaled beijing, china which is know as one of the most pullated cities in the world. this could have made people go to the hostiptal because they could have gotten sick or even die from the pullotion. many countries are banning cars for a couple of days each year because of this global problem. according to car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota in colombia they have a program that bans cars a for a day which leaves people to walk, hike or even bike to where they need to go. its a good way to take away stress and lower air pullotion said carlos arturo plaza.

furthermore not only does it help the envirment for limting car usage and gives relief to peopl. it will also make people healther because they would then have to walk, ride or hike to work or any other place thay need to go. this will strength peoples bodies by doing everyday things more often.  it would require more work to walk to a destiantion rather then to sit down in a car and press on the brake and gas pedal with our foot. limting car usage will not only make people helthier but it will make people less lazy. for example if a person was lazy and had no food in his/her house they would just easly get in there car and drive to a local fast food restruant to get food. on ther other hand if they did not have a car they would have to walk all the way to the grocery story burning off lots of caliores and buying lots more food rather then stoping at a fast food place just to get a quick meal.

in clonclusion limting car usage would be a more beifical thing to do rather then a problem due to the stress reilf, envimental saftey and healther citzens.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Principal;

Community service is a great way to help out your town.

There are many things students can do as community service.

Students can help elementary school students who need help understanding a subject.

Trash liters the school yard and many other public places, making the town look awful.

Also, community service can teach children to be responsible.

I think all students should be required to perform community service.

Many children in elementary school need help to understand their math homework.

However, there are 30 students and only 1 teacher.

It would be very hard on the teacher if they taught the lesson then every student has questions or needs help.

Older students from middle school or even high school could volunteer to go into the class and help out the teacher.

Even if they only go once a week for an hour it would take a tremendous load of the teachers back.

Schools are a place where trash is easily found blowing around in the wind.

It liters the town, making everything look dirty.

However, it can easily be fixed.

When students are required to perform community service the easiest thing to do would be to pick up trash.

Picking up all that trash will more than likely convince the students to stop dropping their trash everywhere.

They will learn that it is better to throw it away the first time than to throw it on the ground to be picked up at some later point in time.

Students think community service is a waste of time and in no way can it benefit them.

However, they are wrong.

By performing community service not only will the students clean up the town, they will get an immense sense of accomplishment.

Plus, students can receive community service hours, which help them increase their chances of getting into college.

Many people feel that community service takes too much time away from what they want to do.

I feel that they can just do one hour a week and it will benefit tem greatly.

Community service is arguably the best way to help your town.

It not only benefits the town, it benefits the students, the children being helped, and the teachers.

The people who are currently performing community service find it a great way to pass time and make new friends.

They think helping the community is very important.

If you require every student at your school to perform at least one hour of community service a week, the results will be astonishing.

"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) that's used for detecting emotions on your face, I'm in between both agajinst and for the use of this on students in classrooms. Being able to detect emotions by scanning someones face isn't wrong because it's not hurting anyone, I just personally think we could be useing the money that would get used to make this for other, more important things than this. This FACS could be used for things outside of students it would be more vaulable, for example, this got used for the Mona Lisa painting to know how she was really feeling, this could be used for so many other things like therapy offices or research in phycology. I also support that if you are sitting in class and the teacher can see how you're feeling, like if you're board, or you don't understand what they are teaching but you don't want to say anything about it so they will be able to improve the lession to make it more fun or help you if you're struggling. I just don't think we should invest all into (if that's what the question is asking) putting these into schools, it does have value just not that much. It has value enough to help depressed people or anyone who needs it. What it comes down to is if we can already detect someones emotion in some type of way then why would we need these in schools?",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Although simple technology doesn't obtain the availability of emotion or feelings, the Facial Action Coding is a valuable resource in the classroom enviornment. If there could be something that helps us better the next generation, why deny that? Why push away something that is only bettering the world?

In the clsssroom a simple tacher can't determine when every single student is confused or getting bored besides the simple fact of asking them. Even then, the students will deny they are confused in fear of fellow students picking on them. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The Facial Action Coding can save the teacher time in trying to figure out who is bored and who is confused, in the end helping out both the student and the teacher.

This technology can be useful in any situation. People don't always share their emotion out loud. We are forced to see how people are feeling simply by their facial expressions, which is sometimes hard to read. Often times people will hide thier emotons by forcing an opposite facial expression for the pleasure of someone else. Wouldn't it just be eaiser to have something that did it for you? "" Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried. ect."" People are forced to read others emotion by their facial expressions which is one of the hardest things to do.

This technology can help so many things in more ways than one. With this technology there could be more realistic virtual things. ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery."" With the Facial Action Coding we are only making the world better, it isn't doing any harm so why not use it? The main goal of every school is to make sure that every student has a safe learning enviornment and to make sure that they have the best resources to help them become the next president or the next surgeon isn't it? This is the best resource so why keep it from them?

Our main purpose should be to make the next generation better than the last. If the Facial Action Coding can help do that, then that is what needs to happen.               ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The aurthor of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" said in paragraph 1, they point out that Venus is sometimes calle the ""Evening Star"" because it is one of the brightest points of light in the nigth sky. Some people mistaken the names beacuse Venus is actually a planet. Venus is the second planet from the sun.

In paragraph 2 it says that Venus is considered Earth's ""twin"". They say that because they are simlar in shape and size. The one of the differences they have is speed. In paragraph 2 it also states that, ""because Venus is sometimes right around the corner - in space terms - humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""

In paragrap 3 it says that, Venus has a thick atmoshpere of almost 97 persent and the layers are considered blankets. The clouds have highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. The temperatures range up to 800 degrees fahrenhiet. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to. The pressure from that would crush a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest partof the ocean.

The aurthor states that the planet Venus is ""inhospitable"" and he/she want to know why Scientists are even discussing going back.

"Have you ever had to make a hard decision so you asked multiple people for they're opinion on that situation? Having multiple opinions on a situation is better than having one opinion because people can offer different point of views to the situation. some people may have experience in the decision you are trying to decide, and when you are making a hard decision all by yourself it can stress you out but when you ask other people for help and get their opinion it can relieve stress from yourself.

Firstly, People can offer many different point of views on the situation and can provide different opinions about the situation. Many people have very good decision making skills and help from those people can help you evaluate your decision and help you make a final decision.

secondly, asking for advice to somebody who has gone through the same situation will be a very good help, people who can relate about your dilemma will be the best help to someone who is struggling to make a decision on their own.

lastly, when making a hard decision all by yourself it can stress you a lot. research shows that putting a lot of stress on the body when you are trying to make a decision can often make you choose the wrong solution. Asking other people for advice can help you relieve your stress and can help you make the right decision without stressing your body.

Having many opinions on a situation is better than having one opinion, because people can give you a different point of view on the situation than you had before. some people may have experience in the decision you are trying to decide, and when you are making a hard decision all by yourself it can stress you out but when you ask other people for help and get their opinion it can relieve stress from your body. that is why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that our character traits are not solely determined by our own choices, but rather by the influences we encounter throughout our lives. While we may have some control over the way we present ourselves to others, the way we truly are and the way we treat people is largely shaped by external factors.

Firstly, the way we are is heavily influenced by our upbringing. Our parents, siblings, and other family members play a significant role in shaping our personalities and values. They instill in us the beliefs and behaviors that they deem important, and we often internalize these as our own. For example, if our parents consistently treat others with kindness and respect, we are more likely to do the same. Similarly, if we are exposed to negative influences such as bullying or abuse, it can have a lasting impact on our self-esteem and behavior.

Secondly, the way we treat people is also heavily influenced by external factors. Our social environment, including our peers, teachers, and community, can have a significant impact on our behavior. For example, if we are surrounded by people who are kind and supportive, we are more likely to act in the same way. On the other hand, if we are exposed to negative influences such as criticism or rejection, it can have a lasting impact on our self-esteem and behavior.

Finally, the way we tell ourselves to be is also influenced by external factors. Our internal dialogue, or the way we talk to ourselves, is often shaped by our experiences and the messages we receive from others. For example, if we are constantly told that we are not good enough or smart enough, we may internalize these beliefs and struggle with self-doubt. On the other hand, if we are surrounded by positive reinforcement and encouragement, we are more likely to have a positive self-image and feel confident in our abilities.

In conclusion, while we may have some control over the way we present ourselves to others, the way we truly are and the way we treat people is largely shaped by external factors. Our upbringing, social environment, and internal dialogue all play a significant role in shaping our character traits. As such, it is important to be aware of these influences and strive to make conscious choices that align with our values and goals.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"TEACHER_NAME,

Not all students can maintain a B average. If you change the school policy. You will probably have less Extra Curricular activities and less students wanting to come to Everglades High. The football team will probably have to quit knowing that you will not accept any other grades. Plus, not all teacher faculty curves grades. I'm not even able to keep up a B average all the time. Most parents cannot pay money for a tutor. Tutoring isn't cheap. So, you might want to think twice before you change the policy. It would also mean less sports agents coming to the school. Even if they are here to see students that are keeping up the average.

Most children come to your school because of the sports and other multiple activities in your school. If you take it away nobody would be coming here cause they want to. But, because there forced to. Kids need freedom and most of theirs are the schools activities. Taking that away would be like taking away their future, passion, and hope. It helps them keep believing in things. Even if that thing is maintaining a C average. Think twice before you get laid off. It's probably not everyday that someone is trying to tell you how and when to do the right thing or job. But, I am telling you now, and like it is. Minors will be miserable knowing that they get kicked off a team for a C. Then everybody would give up hope on you too.

"Dear Principal,

To begin with, I think this world is here to be on and do anything we want too.

But I think that our community is important to us because its a place to have fun with friends and family.

But its full of different kinds of both good and bad stuffs.

I think every student in schools should Perform in community service.

Not only student parents can also volunteer if they want too.

We can find a way for students to participate to perform community service, like do a party or have fun after participating

But some might say it takes up their planning time but I think if everyone participates it wouldn't be so hard. We could also find a way for them like do it twice a day or schedule a time so they can do they can do what they need to do.

I think if we take care of the community other place might do it too.

"Dear Principal,

I think that you should allow Policy 1 for our school. Policy 1 is having phones at school but not using them during class periods. Students should be able to have cell phones. Every student has a right to bring a cell phone, but they won't use them during class because that's not one of their rights. Cell phones can be used as an emergency. If a student has an emergency, they cant use their cell phone because of Policy 2. If you consider Policy 1, then a student will be able to use their phone if an emergency occurred. If a student comes home alone and they see an unfamiliar car in their drive way or something, they can't use their phone because you wouldn't let them due to Policy 2. With Policy 1, the student can call their parents or parent and tell them and the parents would tell them what to do.

Some students express themselves through a phone. If they don't have it, they don't know what to do. If you tell them that they can have it but only during lunch and free time, they will be fine then. Everyone will have the right to bring their phone but they also have the right not to bring it. In Policy 2, students can't bring their phone at all. In Policy 1, students at least have choices about what they can do.

I agree that some students may be using them during class and they should not have the privilege to use them anymore in school. The thing is, what if students weren't using them during class and couldn't bring them anymore. Then, they can't use them at all even though they didn't in the first place and others got cell phones taken away from them.

I agree that there should be a stop to students using them during class. I was thinking, if students get caught using them, they would have to do community service for a day to help the community get clean and they will know not to do it again. Many of your students are dedicated to their phone and need it, but if they make the wrong decision and use it during class, then you can tell them they can't use it anymore during free time and lunch. If a student keeps breaking and breaking the rules, then I think you can take the phone away from them and, like I said before, give them community service. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you agree with me and consider Policy 1.

"Dear Principle,

I strongly suggest you should allow students to have their cell phones out during the lunch time, and free time. They should definitely turn their phones off during class time, because we need to get their education. During class time, if some students just paying attention to their phones, they wouldn't get any learning done, or even pay attention to what the teachers are saying. I suggest, when coming into the class room, the students hand their phone over to the teacher, or must show the teacher him or her turning it off. The teacher would know that the students paying attention then. Having your phone in class, is foul. What if there is a test coming up, and the class is going over it, and the student is not paying attention. That student would fail, just because of his or her phone. The only time through out the day they should have their phones should be, free time and lunch. There is no learning being done, so why not have it out. There really isn't no harm in having your phone out during those times of the school day. If the students shows defiance, or abuse to the phone rule, the phone should get taken from that student. The students should get three warnings. 1. Warning. 2. Taken till end of class. 3. Parent has to come get it. Its good that you may allow us to have phones out, but if they abuse these rules, you should cut students from having phones in or at our school period.

"I believe that the aurthor of this writing is going on the right track. I am going to argue that the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is something that will happen, and that it isnt something that will be fiction but rather fact.

The author of this article states that sometime in the near future there will be a time that cars wont need drivers and I believe that he/she is corect because of the factual information that he involves in the article. He/She also states that companies are already attempting to create a truly, 100% diverless car, and I belive that in the near future that can be a true possibility. I also think that in the future people will still try and criticise the car but in truth the so called ""driverless"" car will become true and it will work up to what the article states and possibly even better than what is stated in the article. Aslo in the case of an accident I believe that the blame will go both to the manufacture and the driver because it was the manufature's work and it was the driver's responsibility to keep an eye on the road anyway.

In concusion I believe that in the near or farther future we will eventualy have driverless cars around just as much as we have actual driver required cars today. Also with all of the testing and the advancements in technology, the ""driverless"" cars isn't somnething of fiction but rather something af a very possibly fact.

"Cell phones are very dangerous in today's time. Did you know that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction that driving under the influence of alcohol? Did you know that it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car? Did you know that having your cell phone in your hand is illegal in today's time? I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.

To start off, there are several things that could happen if you choose to use your cell phone while driving. You could run off the road, you could hit someone else's car, or you could hit an actual person. You never know what could happen if you choose to pick up your phone. You should consider other motorists. You should consider protecting the pedestrians. You should consider your passengers. You should defiantly consider yourself.

Using your cell phone while driving is something that you shouldn't do. You never know what other lives you could affect just because you want to use your phone. Maybe you think, it will just be for a few seconds to text someone back but in those few seconds your life can change tremendously. It only takes a few seconds to park your car. Instead of taking your own life and someone else's in those few seconds, you can park your car and then use your phone. The vehicles can be replaced but the people inside those vehicles can't.

Finally, using your phone while driving is illegal. If you choose to use your phone, you are going to end up having to pay a ticket, living with the regret of hurting other people around you and living with pain because of the minute you needed on your phone. Whoever you think you must respond to or look at, would much rather you make it to your destination in one piece then responding to their text or call.

That person would want you to wait until you are parked than to take someone else's life and your own.

In conclusion, it all comes down to using your phone while driving or not. I hope you always remember that one text, call, or scroll is not worth it. Keep your eyes on the road and always give behind the wheel, all your effort. No one wants to get into a car wreck, sometimes it does happen but don't let the reason of it be, you are using your phone.

"Many people tend to have some trouble making decisions on some problems like, who to choose over the other person or whether or not to move away and leave everything behind and get a really good job. People do make the wrong choices sometimes, thats why we ask other people for their advice to get a better and honest choice. When we ask one person for their advice we don't really have that much to choose from because we don't know whether it would be the right choice to make. having people around that are willing to give someone advice is a good thing to have because sometimes people can't make choices for themselves. Seeking advice from several people could increase the chances of making the right choice by, giving people multiple choices to choose from, people being honest, they can tell u why they made the choice.

people need to be honest when they are giving out advice because if not then were giving out lies and we shouldn't be. Lying about advice we give to people can put people in bad situations and it's not okay. honesty helps when people give advice we need to make sure it's advice we would give ourselves in that same situation and its a good thing to seek opinions from others when we have trouble making choices as long as we know it's right and they aren't lying about it. Everyone likes to hear the truth no one wants to be lied to when it comes to advice because the problem could be important like, money problems or going to court but can't because the car isn't starting. People have trouble sometimes and need help when they dont know what to do. Be honest about it.

Giving people advice it a good thing to do it gives multiple choices to choose from when needed. people get frustrated when they can't decide on what to eat, what to drink, and what clothes to wear. Some people get upset and break down when things are not working out for them so they call parents, siblings, friends, or anyone they are close to. Multiple peoples opinions come great when someone is in a rough situation because when we don't have any opinions or one opinion we don't have options do chose from.

It's good to be supportive and helpful when it is needed.

people normally want a reason as of to why they think its best to make that choice. It is a good way to prove that what the advice was wasn't just said for no reason. When we give advice we need to give a reasoning on how and why we gave it. Many others think as if no one really cares as much when the give advice it's good to ask several people why its a good thing to make that choice because if not don't add the advice in. this is why it is very important to give people a reasoning.

People dont put it as easy to make our own decisions, it can be hard and it's better to seek advice from more than one person because when u get one persons advice it's not really going to help anyone out. Having several peoples opinions makes it less hard on people to make a choice all they would have to do is say whether or not it's right or wrong. Given a choice is easier way then coming up with something on our own. If one person was to give us their opinion how would we know if they are guiding us to make the right choice. This is why it is better to ask several people.        ",0,persuade_corpus,1

When it tells of how it could modify the lesson when it recognizes a student becoming bored sounds reasonable, when you think about it, having a computer changing a lesson simply due to possibly a single student becoming bored with it, would not only make the lesson longer, but maybe even worse off than it might've been.

There is also te question of what if the computer gets something wrong or has a glitch? what if it accedentily misinterpruts sadness as anger for example. Not only will this cause a plethera of complications, it may also lead to the computer making other mistakes in the process.

"Summer break has long been a staple of the school year for students and is widely viewed as an important facet of traditional education. On the one hand, there are many benefits to having a summer break. For example, after spending a long school year focusing their energies on their studies, the break allows students to rest and recuperate, helping them to re-energize and avoid burnout. Furthermore, students can use the break to engage in activities which supplement their education, such as volunteering, attending summer camps, or taking classes that their school doesn't offer. On the other hand, some argue that the gap in learning that can occur over a summer break results in a 'brain drain' which can set back students' academic performance upon returning to school each year. Studies have shown, however, that the impact of the summer vacation on student achievement is modest and that, overall, the positive effects of having a break outweigh the negatives.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Dear Principal,

I have heard you were going to consider changing school policy about at least having B grade average to participate in school events. I think that would be a good decision for not only the students, but also for the school. There are many students who just participate in events but do not study at all on their school work. Personally I believe that these activities are huge distractions to the students and take up the time after school for studying. All though I do have to admit that playing sports is a good thing for if a person wants a wants a scholarship to a university but then they also need the right grades to help them maintain the scholarship. Also so basically i believe that it would be great decision if you were to stop the C students from immersing themselves in distractions.

But if you were to let the B students participate in school activities they would probably become too distracted. Which would then lead to their grades falling thus turning them from B to C students very quickly. Unless students were able to do both work and enjoy school activities, there would be no need for this new policy. And also if you were to make this an actual policy, the school would look all the more better. A school where every student gets at least a B average, what kind of parent wouldn't send their kids to the place. Which lead to a bigger standard leading to more high graded students.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear, school principal

I've heard that you are considering a new policy for students to use cell phones. I think that students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school. since you are the principal I think that you should try it out first and see how every student behaves when they have their cell phones.

In my opinion students should be allowed to bring in their cell phones to school. If they bring them in to the school then i think that they would be getting into less trouble .You may be wondering that how would they get into less troble, well the answer is simple. If you allow the students in our school than they wouldn't have to sneak in their phones. Sneaking their phones into the school would get kids into trouble easily.

Have you ever got worried because a person that is always calling you is not calling you no more? Maybe its because that person had an emergency and did not call you because she was in a place where no cell phones were allowed.

If students get to use their cell phones during their lunch period or in any other free time than they would be able to check their lost calls and their messages. They would contact their parents whenever they don't feel well. They would also be less worried knowing that everybody in the family is in good health conditions.

I think that students should really have their cell phones at all times. they should use them only in free periods and not while being in class. You should really think about it and see how it all works out.

Yours truly,

"I do not want to retake this year, but I also do not want to miss my soccer practice. What would I do? If my school made it a requirement to take extra school lessons like sports, yearbooks, or student council would I agree or not. I believe a student should not have to participate in other activities, because students already have enough homework from regular classes and electives, have their own activities after school, and the school would be more packed.

Doing the required activities means the activities will give out homework. Many students already have enough homework in their daily bases, and while taking another activity can increase more time on homework and shorten other activities the students would like to enjoy. After school I like taking naps, but if I have lots of homework then I would not be able to do so. Some students may have tests the following day and would like to study for it, but having more homework the student may not study as much as they would like to. In conclusion students already have enough homework and should not have to take extra activities and get more homework.

Many students have activities after school they do on their own time. Some students, like myself, may have more than one activity they are balancing. I have soccer, piano, and swimming that happens every week, and if I take school activities then I would not be able to take my own lessons. When students are required to take school activities their schedule might not have enough time to do the their own activity. If students do not take the required activity they might repeat a year, and many students would not like to retake a hard year. Although there are lots of people who also do not take activities it would be crucial to the kids that do. In conclusion when students take other activities outside of school and are required to take extracurricular activities students would not be able to their own.

If every single student is taking the extracurricular activity that would make the school crowded. When taking other activities it wouldn't be like taking normal school lessons, because there may be more people taking one activity and there would not be enough room for the students. If everyone would take the sports activity the school would not have enough gyms for everyone to go to. In conclusion if a students are required to take extra activities the school would not have enough rooms or activities.

I believe a student should not have to participate in other activities, because students already have enough homework from regular classes and electives, have their own activities after school, and the school would be more packed. If the principle decides to do these activities they should let the activities be somewhere outside of school. Allowing the activities not to have homework would also be really helpful. The school should also make the activities on some days and not everyday so students have other things to do they can do the school activity on another day. Although these would be helpful the extracurricular classes should not be required.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Everyone should be able to choose for them self's. To help or to help. my out take on this yes we should help more but then again not all people have the same ideas and views on the world or the fact that they have to waste time helping some one who really needs it. I do it time to time out there an its fun. Hard but fun. If i could go back in time to summer where i first got my job at the library i would still do. I met alot of nice people and did alot of good things while i worked there an i was thinking bout working there again in this coming up summer. I wish it to be the same.

You also have to know that most people like things done for them i do at least. And not everyone is going to go out there help out. Even if u force them to. to help good help is to have people that really want to help. I say just form them to try it an see how it goings an if they like they like it but don't force them to. I would say make them do one to two hours of it. Then see how it goes and then take it from there. Everyone is different so don't think its going to work out because you might get some one that really wants to help an you might get some one that dose not want to have any to do with it. I wish more people help out more but u can't really help it. I want to see people helping time to time and when i see them help it makes me feel good that this green world is still in work mood.

I can't say I've done alot of work but i can say I've at least tried to help. This one time i help out a shelter for animals. It was sad but i felt good knowing that i helped. I would like a dog but my presents say I'm not old enough to take care of it because m not always around the house so i guess their right. I'm runny out of time so i guess what I'm trying sure why not go for it.

"Our school principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. Many students are for and against this decision. Cell phones should not be allowed in school. There are many reasons to support my decision. Some reasons are that they are a distraction, can be used for cheating, and can be used to do dangerous or inappropriate things.

First and foremost cell phones are a complete distraction. Using cell phones in school will only make students not pay attention to their teachers. While their teacher is teaching they will be texting and ignoring the lesson. Students will be clue less on class work because they didn't pay attention to the lesson because of their phones. Students will end up failing their classes.

In addition these devices can be used as a source of cheating. While students are taking tests they can easily take out their phones and start texting each other answers. For example, one of my old friends was caught cheating on her test. Since her school allowed phones they thought it would be acceptable to text each other answers. As a result my friend ended up getting a zero on her important test and had to repeat the year. She now also had a record of being a cheater.

Lastly, phones can be used to do inappropriate things. Some students might even use their phones to cyber bully someone. Bullying someone can get you in a load of trouble. It can also cause many problems to the person being bullied. For instance sometimes they might even get mentally or physically hurt. They might even want to put an end to their own life. According to ""Time Magazine"" 75% of students in the U.S are being bullied to death.

In conclusion cell phones should definitely not be allowed on school grounds. They will just be a huge distraction to everybody. Cell phones can even be used for hurting some one and cheating on tests. These devices would just be unnecessary for school.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Phones & Driving

During the past few years, phones become very popular in the world. Every generation has a telephone. A phone is just now a big part of the society today. Most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone. Phones become very distracted. Many accidents happened because of phones. Phones are taking over the world, and a lot of people are getting addicted to their phones. Knowing that it is dangerous to text and drive, we still do it; 90 % of you agreed to have texted while driving. I'd be lying if I said I had never texted while driving. But I recognize the dangers, and use the alternatives to prevent a car accident. It doesn't matter what commercials we seen, or what car accident we have witness, we still text and drive and it's a fact.

In this generation, texting and driving have been the leading cause of car accidents, especially for teenagers. A lot of teenagers are losing their life cause of texting and driving. Most people think texting and driving are underrated. Some teenagers think that other teenagers that have an accident while texting and driving just don't know how to drive well. So they do it because they think that they can prevent it from happening to them because they can have control of it. The importance of texting while driving should be addressed to anyone obtaining a valid driver's license and can operate a vehicle. This particular proposal should develop a direct impact on life because it can help many people to understand what would happen and hopefully teach them a lesson of the consequence when you text and drive. People really need to know and understand how easily it is to take theirs and someone else's life. Texting and driving is a serious hazard, which could ultimately cost you your life or others. This pressing issue needs well thought out ads that will convince people to act on this deadly habit and not just be aware of it.

And most of the time in many cases like this be happening to the age group of 18-25.

Not only is texting while behind the wheel bad enough itself, many people compare the danger level to drunk driving. Driving while intoxicated at the same time is illegal, just as some believe texting while driving should be as well. Drunk driving is another top cause of car accidents that happen every day. If people were more aware of how closely related texting while driving and drunk driving are, it would help to inform all drivers on safety behind the wheel. All of these hazards on the road are making other drivers very nervous. Texting while driving puts many driver's lives in danger daily. Multiple people feel that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road ahead, although it isn't. It can harm others on the road who are doing nothing other than trying to make it to their destination safely. If people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving, less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer. Distracted drivers need to know the position they put others in as well as themselves. While behind the wheel, drivers should never direct their attention to their cell phone and should always keep their eyes on the road.

It is obvious that texting and driving is extremely dangerous, but the majority of drivers continue doing so. Even with all the stories of disastrous car accidents transpiring as a direct outcome of distracted driving, teens and adults are still texting at the wheel. Overall I think a phone shouldn't be allowed in cars while driving. People should put their phones away like in their purse or somewhere it can't cause a distraction to them, because I know for fact that as soon as that phone ring or a notification comes on most people would reach for that phone, and it's at that moment their focus on the driving is lost. If people follow that rule, I think the rate of a car accident would decrease, and people would be alive and well. Today, texting while driving out numbers the amount of drunk driving according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Texting while driving is ten times more likely to cause a big accident than drunk driving. You are 23 times more likely to have an accident if you are texting.

A phone is just now a big part of the society today. Most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone. Phones become very distracted. Many accidents happened because of phones. For this reason, many states are making new laws designed to curb such risky habits amongst drivers and enhancing safety on the road for others. In conclusion, texting while driving is a big issue, we are doing it every day and not realizing how much we are putting our lives in a danger and even the others people. Leave the phone alone or at home while you are driving because a text is not worth your life and somebody else's, that text will be there when you done driving or when you get home.

"The Facial Action Coding System,can read peoples expressions.

Should this technology be used in classrooms to detect the emotins of the students?

This technology should not be used to detect the emotions of students. The article stated that this tech, could be used to detect when a student is getting tired or bored of the lesson. This would then allow the computer to liven the lesson up, as the text states directly, ""Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor."" This line makes it seem like it(the FACS technology) would replace teachers in the classroom.

Teaches do not need technology to tell if their students are bored, as the text says, people just know what the emotions of others are. The teacher would know when, and how to modify the lesson to keep their students interested, and engaged. Would we know what the technology would do to modify the lesson? Would the students just be able to be angry at the lessons until the computer just stops giving the student lessons? Using this tech is not an alternative to having a real person tell how you feel. The teacher can help you feel better because they know how you really feel, because they have empathy. The computer can tell how you feel, but it does not what it is like to feel, so in the end it can't really help.

Should the FACS tech be used in the classroom? No, because the students need a teacher to help them feel better when they are frustrated or sad, not a computer that can only try and make them happy. It also seem sthat they want this tech, to replace our teachers,which would hurt the students more than it would help them.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I do not approve to let people use any type of technology to read emotions. That is when it gets weird and people ask why are you feeling this way. This can sometimes lead to the student getting even sadder or madder than they were. If they are left alone and no one knows what is wrong, they will be fine.

To start off, expressions can not forsure tell what that person is feeling. I have seen people so mad but continue throughout their day like everything is fine. Plus, if that student is just doing a fake smile, that does not mean that they are really happy. The FACS can not read emotions but reads the emotions it thinks you are feeling because of what your facial expression is.

Therefore, to end my argument, in paragraph 9 it says that contracting your smile muscles can help you feel slightly happy. This means it can make you SLIGHTLY happy but not enough to classify yourself as happy and I do not approve to let people read emotions. It is unnecessary and we should be researching something better than this.               ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The author makes a claim by telling how venus is a worthy pursuit. If we went to go visit venus,we would learn everything about what lived or growed on venus.

"Homework and studying is hard enough for some students. Being so exhausted and completely worn out after coming back from school is one of the most irritating feelings. One school principal announced to classroom that every every student must have one extracurricular activity. Some students were furious, knowing how hard school already is. Thinking of how they're going to manage their daily routine with another class to take.

For students that are in higher advanced classes or for students that have trouble learning, this change can really affect how they work. While your trying to complete a missing or trying to study for the next test, students have to forget about that and go to their extracurricular activity. Giving to much work for students can affect their emotions, which can turned into stress or anxiety. For students who have trouble learning, they could be struggling in all their classes and can't try to study or practice on their subject since they have to go to their extra class. This much work can lead to the student not paying attention, to procrastinate, and to give up more easily.

While students are working on their homework, studying, and doing their extracurricular class, they will lose time to spend with their family. To much work can take up precious time in your day, whether it is hanging it with your friends or family, going outdoors, or just relaxing. At times students with have to work all night and not sleep at all. When students lose sleep they concentrate less and don't focus in their classes. When you lose time sometimes you don't get all your work complete which could and will affect your grade. Time is essential and now some students are losing it.

The ability to choose if you want to join something, like a club, is good since it's you that wants to do it or not. An extracurricular activity is not a choice, it seems unfair that the students don't get to choose if they want to do it or not. At times the students aren't even interested in any of the activity's. Some students don't like playing sports, drawing for the year book, or serve for the student council. Students should have the choice if they want to do an activity or not.

While students are working hard and trying to get through the year, the school can't just force them to do another subject. Students can get stressed and get to much work to do, losing their concentration. They will lose time to spend with their family and friends. They don't get the chance to choose if they want to take an extracurricular activity or not. In the end, an extracurricular activity is just another thing to worry about.             ",0,persuade_corpus,3

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, the Dr. Huang says ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" he is trying to said that they experiment is not just for people, he is says that is universal so that mean is for all that have face or that the Facial Action Cording System can read emotions for example:The Facial Action can read the Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa.

"Do you agree or disagree that student should or shouldn't join a activity. I disagree that student shouldn't need to join a activity, because the students need to have fun with family and friends and they need time to finish homework and get enough sleep that most don't it.

They need to have fun in their life time. An examples is that they go to playground when ever they want to go because to helps the students to lose energy and feel alive as a very young adult. An other examples is that they need time to be with loved one and friends because to spend time with them and feel happy around to enjoy life to the fullest. That why I think that kids need time to them self.

They need time to do homework to get out of trouble. An examples is that they don't we worried about it because they did it the night before it. An other examples is that student feel stress out about it because when they get home from their after school activity they have to finish their work late at night and their parents can get worried about learning. That why I think to take all homework away.

I heard you are considering changing the schools policy so that the students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I think that's crazy!

I know if you do intend to proceed in changing the policy we students will try to get better grades to play the sport, but not every kid has a GPA of 4.0. So their for i propose my idea to keep the policy that you just have to have a 2.0! Seriously, as my 6th grade teacher told me, ""something is better than nothing"". Sure you want us to have good grades but us kids,(teens) want to be involved in school activities but with or with out good grades i think if they strive hard enough they deserve the right to be involved.

"Becoming a professional makeup artist requires a combination of specialized training, education, and experience. By partnering with local companies, students can explore the art of being a makeup artist while accessing hands-on training and opportunities.

Taking courses in makeup artistry can help improve a student’s personal social health in a variety of ways. For example, students can learn the proper techniques for applying cosmetics, how to choose the right products, and how to stay up to date on the latest beauty trends. Additionally, the courses can help people to learn how to take care of their hair, do their makeup, and dress appropriately - all of which are essential skills for a successful career in makeup artistry.

At a personal level, students can benefit from increased confidence as they learn various skills related to makeup and styling.

"Sometimes, you can be wrong. Most of the time people recognize it, so you go to other people for advice. Seeking multiple opinions is a good idea because you get more input, you can combine ideas to make one super plan, and if someone knows something you don't, then you can correct your idea and make it better.

One reason getting different opinions is a good idea is because you can get multiple second opinions. The best that could happen is that you and whoever you are talking with can add so many good opinions to your ideas that you could do something great with it, like design a great video game, or develop a new medicine, or maybe make a way to keep our soldiers safe in combat. If nobody gives any good opinions, you might just get laughed at. Not a lot of bad could come out of it.

Another reason second opinions are a good idea is because you can combine them into one super plan. Lets say you were playing a strategy video game called Total War-Three Kingdoms. You might want to do just a frontal assault on the castle walls, and take them by force, but your friend might point out that they have heavy

Pole arms up on the wall, a great anti-infantry unit. Your other friend says you need to take down the arrow towers along the wall to stop the enemy from peppering your troops with arrows as you assault the walls, and also need to use

T

rebuchets to destroy them. Then, you combine all the plans into one massive one- use the

Trebuchets to both destroy the arrow towers and destroy the walls, taking out chunks of the wall so your troops can breach into the fortress, knocking the

Pole arms off the wall (effectively killing them), and taking out the arrow towers. Now that's good teamwork.

The final reason second opinions are better than only your own is if somebody knows information that you don't, they can provide it and you can revise whatever your idea or plan is. Say you are playing the same game (Total War-Three Kindoms), and this time you are defending on an open plane. You are maneuvering your troops into a defensive position that will be great for deflecting frontal attacks, when your ally tells you that they saw that the other team has a unit of the

Black Mountain Marauders

(a very good anti-infantry duel-ax wielding unit with the special ability to be able to be deployed behind the enemy), but you and your ally notice that they aren't with the main enemy army. Your ally realizes that they must be hidden in the trees off to the left of your main army, and that if you hadn't realized it, they would have flanked your army and taken a massive toll. So, your ally decides that you hold off the main army, and he uses his archers and cavalry to rain hell on the hidden ax warriors so they don't destroy you. How fun and violent.

So, second opinions are almost always better than one. Sure, you might know what you're doing, but ask trusted others what their take on the situation is. The reasons you do this is because more inputs produce better ideas, you can combine inputs into one super opinion, and others might know key information that you don't, so listen.",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Inactivity has long been associated with negative outcomes, such as decreased productivity and poor health. However, recent research suggests that taking breaks and engaging in inactivity can actually have several advantages in fostering success. In this essay, I will analyze the benefits of taking breaks for understanding tests, long hours of work, mental rejuvenation, and physical health.

Firstly, taking breaks can aid in understanding tests. Studies have shown that taking short breaks during exams can improve memory retention and reduce stress levels. This is because taking breaks allows the brain to rest and recharge, which can lead to increased focus and productivity when resuming the task. Moreover, taking breaks can help to break up the monotony of studying, making it more engaging and enjoyable.

Secondly, taking breaks can be beneficial for long hours of work. Working for extended periods without taking breaks can lead to burnout and decreased productivity. Taking breaks can help to alleviate this by providing a much-needed break from the task at hand. This allows for mental rejuvenation and a fresh perspective on the task. Furthermore, taking breaks can help to prevent eye strain and reduce the risk of physical health problems such as headaches and back pain.

Thirdly, taking mental breaks can aid in finding creative solutions. Entrepreneurs often find that taking a break from their work can help them to come up with new and innovative ideas. This is because taking breaks allows the mind to wander and explore new possibilities. By stepping away from the task, entrepreneurs can gain a fresh perspective and come up with new solutions that they may not have considered before.

Lastly, taking breaks for physical and mental rejuvenation is essential for overall health and well-being. Taking breaks can help to reduce stress levels and improve mood. Moreover, taking breaks can help to prevent physical health problems such as eye strain, back pain, and headaches. Furthermore, taking breaks can help to improve cognitive function and memory retention, which can lead to increased productivity and success.

In conclusion, taking breaks and engaging in inactivity can have several advantages in fostering success. Taking breaks can aid in understanding tests, long hours of work, mental rejuvenation, and physical health. By taking breaks, individuals can improve their productivity, reduce stress levels, and find creative solutions to problems. Therefore, it is important to take breaks regularly and incorporate them",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

Dear Senator,

What do you think about the Electoral Collage? The electoral collage is a process,not a movement. The Electoral collage is unfair to the citizens of the united states. Its unfair to voters because they are not able to vote for a president of their like. Another reason the Electoral Collage is unfair is because citizens are not voting for their president they are voting for a slate of elector how will pick the president for them.

Citizins are givin the rights to vote. The electoral collage is a way of taking voting away from them. Why would someone want to vote if they are not going to be able to vote for a president of their like. The single best argument against the electoral collage is what they might call the disastor factor. The electoral collage is also unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning president candidate.

What is voting to a citizin? Isint voting a right for citizens to vote for their president of their choice? Why take it away from them with the electoral collage. If you look at it from an american citizen prospective its like they dont even have a word when choosing their president. What di Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S. Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on? they agreed on abolishing the electoral collage! According to a Gallup poll in 2000 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct elections.

"You hear it all, throughout breaking news; to protesters trying to make a difference in our world. Pollution is dangerous and people don't fully understand the costly effects to our everyday living. Transportation is a way of means by transitioning from one place to another. The most popular way of transportation is the vehicle. A fast and easy way to get to your destination with just a turn of the key, or in this case now-a-days, the click of a button.

Acres of land being towed to create bigger roads, or streets because of the vast majority of people using cars to get around. With each car means more gas or diesel, more gas equals more money, and more pollution. Our atmosphere can only take so much from the faulty mistakes we choose to do everyday. Places like Paris and suburbs in Germany are becoming more aware of how much cars can effect our Earth.  After days of near record pollution Paris decided to enforce a 'partial driving ban' to clear some of the air in the global city. The way they enforced this was motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home. The same would apply for the odd numbered license plates the following day. After this, smog and congestion decreased by 60 percent in the capital of France. Other places like Bogota, Columbia is having 'car free day' where millions of people would enjoy their day outside hiking, biking, and taking buses for work during the day. These decisions and actions cleared the streets in Bogota and avoided jams, leaving the people to have a nice day enjoying the outdoors. Carlos Arturo says ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

This doesn't mean give up cars all in all. Rather, limit the use of driving your car. America's love affair with vehicles seem to be dulling down. After 2005, the number of miles driven started to decrease. Part of the explanation to this lies in the recession, because tight budget Americans could'nt afford new cars, and the unemployed were'nt going to work. Sociologists believe if these patterns of decreasing numbers of car owners and people driving-- that it will have beneficial outcomes for carbon emissions and the enviroment. On the opposing side this has a negative effect for the car industries.

The positive effects will benifit future generations to come, with clean air to breathe and a fresh start. By limiting car usage there would be less traffic jams, more people getting in touch with their surroundings and even losing 3 to 5 pounds while they're at it. Transportation is a way of means by transitioning from one place to another, it doesn't always have to be a vehicle with so many other options you can choose from. Make a difference in the world, one less car at a time.             ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"There are many different plants in our solar system. You may have a favorite one or maybe you're just not that interested in it. Well have you ever thought about taking a trip to the moon or just the planet period maybe even studying a planet just for fun? It will cause you to think about the 5 w's first the who, who will be there are there lots of humans just floating around in space? what will it be like, what would it look like? Why did someone create this?

when did everything take place? Why did it take place? Where did everything all begin And what made someone think of this ?

Let's say you studied Venus. Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planted in our solar system. It could be by far the most exiciting plant that you could ever study and the greatest dangerous one too. Beyond high pressure and heat Venus geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. Venus causes many things to corrupt without venus there would be many corruptions in the world. But so does any other planet right? Not every planet is a good planet.

How is Venus tested and when was it discorved ? According to the text,"" Many astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planted in our solar system"" The text also states that "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. "" Different plantes have been here for over 1,000 years crazy right, If you was to imagine what life would be like with out planets or gravity keeping everything in check what would we be up to right now. We need these things to survive.

Venus could be the most by far dangerous planet to visit the text says ,"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". The text also states that, "" On the plantet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This goes to show that if you were able to take a trip to Venus you probaly would pass out or either die because the tempature is not average compared to the Earth's and there's less oxygen.

You might take it into concederation that we should not be limited to on things we want to do just because the danger of things, and I agree because the world be so much better if we did what we wanted. Studying a planet and actually going to see about it could be someone's biggest dream but they are stopped by it because of the outcome. Many people say chase your dream but how if we stuck in the same mind frame as everyone else.      ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Extracurricular activities are a big part of school life. Some people think they're super important, while others think they're a waste of time. In my opinion, both sides have good points.

One pro of extracurricular activities is that they help you make new friends. For example, I joined the robotics club in my school, and I met a lot of cool kids who like the same things as me. We have fun building robots and competing in tournaments together. It's nice to have a group of friends who share your interests.

Another pro is that extracurricular activities can help you learn new things. Like, I'm in the drama club, and we get to learn about different acting techniques and stagecraft. It's really fun, and I've learned a lot. Plus, it's a great way to get involved in school events and show off your talents.

But there are also cons to extracurricular activities. One con is that they can be really time-consuming. Like, sometimes I have to stay after school for robotics club, and it's hard to get all my homework done. Plus, it can be hard to balance extracurricular activities with other stuff like family time and chores.

Another con is that some extracurricular activities can be really exclusive. Like, the drama club is mostly for kids who are already really into acting, and it can be hard for people who aren't as interested to join in. It's important to make sure that all kids feel included and have a chance to participate in activities that they're interested in.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities can be really fun and rewarding, but they can also be time-consuming and exclusive. It's important to find a balance and make sure that all kids have a chance to participate in activities that they enjoy.

I hope this essay shows you what I think about extracurricular activities! Let me know if you have any questions.",1,llama2_chat,0
"I agree with it because everyone has to do something productive in school and playing a sport is good for our health, yearbook writing is good for our spelling, and serving in a student council makes you be more confident and talk more with other people.

Playing a sport is the best way to make our bodies stronger and healthy, it also helps us mentally when you are going through times going outside and playing helps you a lot. Playing a sport in school helps you have more energy and be ready to learn it likes opens your mind. Soccer for example is helps your body be stronger, Volleyball helps your hands be more stronger, Basketball helps you jump higher, and Football helps you run faster.

Writing or coloring the yearbook is a great idea too, because you are writing something that everyone is going to see so i know you gonna write neat and correctly. Coloring is good for our brains too it helps us be calm and out of stress. Spelling is one of the most important things and writing helps it improved it, coloring is something that not everyone knows how to do it, but by practicing we are gonna learn.

Serving in a student council helps you a lot because you learn something very important and thats learning how to communicate with other people and be nice. Sometimes its hard to communicate or talk to other people but we have to do it because sometimes the people needs someone to talk to and someone to be there for them. Helping to helping is a best thing you can do maybe you are not getting something from it but at least your being a helper.

In conclusion I think that everyone has to do something is school it doesnt matter what but we have to. School is not just for learning and being bored in class, school is for you to be happy and confortle with everything, we can make school fun.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Many schools are starting to offer online schooling for students. Students or teachers may believe this can be a very beneficial program. However, I believe that online classes can be difficult or tough on a student. Students some times need an actual teacher showing or explaining to them face to face content, others take extra-curricular activities, and many students may even forget they have an online class.

First, not every student can learn by just one explanation, many students need a teacher showing them or explaining how to do something. Take for example my cousin, She's taking online classes but has a difficult time learning the material because she doesn't understand the explanation they are giving her. Her struggles with the material is there because she doesn't have an actual teacher explaining why such ans such are like that. Not many students have the capacity to learn off of the words of a website. Many students need that extra help, whether its a different way of learning or just a better explanation.

Secondly, A large amount of students take extra-curricular activities. Many are in an art club, Spanish club, and maybe even drama. The struggles for taking an online class for those would be a large amount. For example, The time I took an online class for art, it was terrible, either I didn't know how to transfer my painting to the computer or I just didn't know how to draw the picture. Extra-curricular activities would be difficult to learn without the extra help of a teacher.

Lastly, Students can even forget they have an online class. Many have jobs, others just like to sleep, they'll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work. For example my cousin, she sleeps a lot, By the time she wakes up she realizes that her assignment was already due. Online classes don't send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class.

In conclusion, online schooling isn't very beneficial. I believe that it can be tougher and more difficult on students. Many need a teacher to show them face to face content, some take extra-curricular activities, and majority of the students forget they even have an online class. For those few reasons is why online schooling shouldn't be an option to students. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Generic_School wants my opinion on students attending classes online while at home. In all honesty, why is this even a question? Of course I think it's a great idea for schools to offer online learning and as a matter of fact; why don't all schools from all states offer this for students? Some of the reasons why I think it's a great idea is because students could lay in their bed while attending class, it would be good for students who don't have transportation to school and the best part is that they don't have to handle bullies.

One of the reasons why I think it's a great idea for schools to offer classes online is because students can get an education while laying in their bed. I believe this is amazing because you can be comfy in your pajamas in bed while attending class, instead of getting up early to get ready for school. If every student was offered to attend their classes online at home, there would honestly be no students coming to school. They would attend their classes online because no one likes getting up early in the morning and we all want to stay in bed. School does start early in the morning and from that, students have a lack of sleep because of the all the homework and projects that are due. Most of all, students have a lot going on at home and that also causes students to lose sleep. Even teachers have a lot going on and yet they get to miss school while we are stuck at school with a sub thinking about all the classwork our teacher has left for us to do or what's going on in our lives and what's next on their plate. Not a lot of schools think about the sleeping patterns us students have because most of us don't sleep at all while others probably sleep for an hour or two. Principals and teachers wonder why us students fall asleep in class and it's because of all the things we are going through at the time. Us students have a lot going on in our lives and sometimes we just don't have the time to sleep or even think about school. That's why most of us miss school so we can get either caught up in sleep and able to think clearly again possibly or get caught up in our classes, then return back to school when everything is complete. If all schools were like this, than us students plus the schools wouldn't have to worry about missing days of school, getting behind in our classes or even being late. We all would be on time and have all the work we needed with us on our computer.

A second reason why I think this it's a great idea for schools to offer classes online is because it would be good for students who don't have transportation. Why should students get behind on their education just because they don't have ta ride to school? I mean schools pl us the county have to think, some students live where buses don't have a route to go anywhere near them. If they have classes online then it's beneficial for them because they have their work with them and the parents don't have worry about their child getting behind. Some parents out in the world don't have a way for their children to get an education and they feel bad about it. With the classes being online, the teachers can facetime the parents and students to see if they have any questions or concerns regarding to the work in their class plus they can help students who are having trouble with the homework or classwork that the teacher has provided or don't understand what is going on in the class. Schools all across the globe should offer this to every student to make things easier for them and take some of the stress off their shoulders.

The third and final reason why I think it's a great idea for schools to offer classes online is because students don't have to deal with other students such as bullies. If you honestly think about it, we have had a lot of deaths of teens and young children committing suicide because of bullying. From my experiences from attending three different schools because of moving, schools don't do nothing about bullying. Yes, they may say something to the student who is doing the bullying, but never actually put a stop to it. Bullying is ruining children's lives and the schools just don't understand that. With the classes being online, students can stay at home not having to worry about being picked on or having a bully come up to them and beat them half to death. Think about it this way, with classes being online where students can stay at home, it's honestly saving lives and decreasing the suicides. Even after a student or five commits suicide from all the bullying and the schools hear about it, they still don't stop the harsh bullying. I bet schools haven't even thought that putting classes online so children can stay at home would even remotely help students stop committing suicide. I mean yes there's always a million other reasons why people do that, but mainly for students it's because of bullies.

In conclusion, I believe that all schools should offer classes online and think about things a bit differently now that I have put my opinion out there for them to hear. Help us students out and help the ones that need it most. It wouldn't hurt for schools for help out students in the best ways as possible and make things a bit easier for us so we don't have as much stress on us. Every single person across the nation deserve all the help they can get and we all deserve an education. Stop making things difficult and start making it easier for everyone.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I can remember countless times when I needed to be somewhere, but I had nobody to take me. The future is here, and an era where driveless cars is upon us. As a nondriver, I think this invention would be very useful, it would help busy parents do their duties for them, like picking up a child from school. It also feeds those lazy teenagers as they rarely want to move or do anything that requires activity. I am deffinetly for driverless cars

Driverless cars are not exactly ready to be manufactered because there are some things cars cannot do that the driver would have to do for them. In paragraph 2 it says that cars that exsist today aren fully driverless because they alert you in tricky situations, like pulling in and out of driveways, or dealing with complicated traffic issues. Certainly this is just a minor problem compared to the actual driving part, and is planned to be figured out in the near future.

BMW made an outbreak in 2013 when they announced the deleopment of their ¨Traffic Jam Assistant¨. This vehicle can drive at speeds up to 25 mph, but there are special sensors that make it mandatory for the driver to keep both hands on the wheel at all time. Human drivers must remain alert, which makes it safer for those around them if something were to go wrong. Cars are alerting the drivers by vibrating seats, and light sflashing on the windsheild, catching the attention of the driver.

Although it would be very helpful and easier for everyone to have a driverless car, it could also be more dangerous. Of course the cars would alert us when we need to take the wheel, but most of the population is involved in their cell phones, what if someone ignores it, or misses the alert of signal? This is why as of now, most states have a law against being able to even test computer-driven cars. Why is everyone slowly relying on technology to do all our work?

Car companies have big plans for the future. In parapgraph 10 it states that Tesla has projected a 2016 reliese for a car capable of driving on autopiolet 90 percent if the time. Other companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and NIssan plan to have driverless cars in the year 2020. As of now there are litlle glitches in the plans and laws would have to be figured out, as well as the safetly and reliance of the people in the car. The future is upon us and we better be buckled up and ready for the ride, driver or not. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"What if you didn't have to drag yourself out of bed and haul yourself to school every morning? What if you could still learn, but stay in a comfortable space? With distance learning, both of these are possible. Distance learning is a way of online or video conferencing to attend classes. This method of teaching is beneficial because it allows for people who are disabled to participate in class and it allows for less money to be spent on school construction; although it is said that online classes make people more anti-social, it actually makes people more safe.

Traditional schools and classrooms do not accommodate those who are disabled; but, if classes were online, everyone would be able to participate. Many students have disabilities that prevent them from being able to walk and speak to their peers. If these students were to attend traditional schools, they would have difficulty navigating narrow, crowded hallways. They would not be able to participate in class or express their opinions. If classes were conducted online, however, these students would be able to stay in the comfort of their homes and type their thoughts out to have a productive conversation with others. They would not have to worry about getting to class physically, and could remain in a comfortable space while still communicating and learning. In addition to those with physical disabilities, online classrooms also help those with mental health issues. Many teenagers have social anxiety, and entering a classroom with a lot of people can bring panic and discomfort. If schools were online however, these teens would not have to experience discomfort in classrooms. They would be able to talk more freely and learn better if they had more control over their surroundings and their communication style. Students benefit from attending classes at home because those with physical disabilities are able to participate in class, and those with mental health limitations would feel more comfortable.

Online classes decrease the amount of money spent on constructing physical schools, resulting in decreased taxes and increased public utilities that students can benefit from. The funding for school construction comes directly from the taxpayer. If schools were conducted online, the cost of construction of a school would be completely eliminated, resulting in less money paid in taxes. This increase in net income for families could allow for students to have better access to resources such as test preparation and online subscriptions to textbooks. As families spend less money on the construction of the school, they are able to spend more on the education itself. In addition to more money dedicated solely to education, online classes also allow for better public amenities. Instead of reserving space for a physical school, state governments can instead construct utilities, such as libraries or gyms. This would give students more resources to use; in the long run, online schools could be a more effective use of space, resulting in more available resources for other utilities. Online schools allow for more spending on education rather than construction, and allow for public amenities that students can benefit from.

It can be argued that online school will result in students not having face to face conversations, therefore creating anti-social students. But, the lack of physical confrontation can actually be beneficial. Although it is less common today, bullying still occurs in schools. Students cannot escape their bullies in person if they have classes with them every day. But, with online classes, students are able to control who can speak to them simply by blocking people who are harmful. For example, a student who is being bullied in all their classes is less likely to learn due to stress and worry about how they will be treated; if this student were to take classes online, they could simply block their bully and stop worrying as much. Online school does not make anti-social students; instead, it creates a better environment for students to effectively communicate in and allows for less bullying. When people feel safe, they are more likely to speak to others and collaborate. Without the constant teasing that often comes with bullying, students will feel more comfortable to discuss their ideas freely. Online school would result in less bullying and therefore would prompt students to have more participation.

Online schools are beneficial to students as they increase participation in class and increase the amount of money spent on education rather than construction; they make students less susceptible by bullying, making students more comfortable and allowing for the flow of discussions easily. Overall, the benefits of online school outweigh the potential drawbacks.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I think that not having cars is a good thing for these small suburban cities cause theyre only like a mile or two so its really not that far.

From what i've heard in this passage and from the sources is that its a big stress reliever and it is to help out the earth there will be less traffic jams,less pollution and more interacting with people cause face it people dont interact socailly anymore and if they do its most likely over the internet.

Another reason i think we should cut down on car use or at least car pull in vans is cause it will leave less emissions in the air and it'll hopefully help the ozone layer repair itself to its natural state

And in conclussion im all for it cause I think that it'll help people get out and get fit and there will be less crashes there be less stress from driving(roadrage/roadragers).    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Seeking out multiple opinions can have a very positive impact on what you are getting or trying. A scenario of this could possibly be attending a high-fashioned dinner. You're going to need a suit or a dress to be able to show class. So, going by a fashion store and picking up one of these clothing items might be the best bet. But, what if the clothes that you picked out don't look good to your friend, and you think they are fantastic? You should probably ask some other people on what they think the right choice is. Seeking out multiple opinions can have a remarkable impact on your personal characteristics.

Having two or more people review one of your choices can only improve your decision and overall practicality of the occasion. You might think something is good looking, but if your friends think that it isn't, then you know you probably shouldn't go with that option. Multiple opinions can create a secure factor of your choices. You'll be able to appeal to almost everyone if multiple people agree on your choice. Having different perspectives and opinions on something has a positive outcome over the final choice. Another factor that also plays in is that if you request for your viewers to be honest, it will narrow your choices down to the very one that is perfect. This is what everyone wants, the proper item for any occasion. Multiple choices will only help this to be achieved by anyone.

So, finding that perfect dress or suit for that occasion can come with ease at the choice of multiple eyes. You will be able to view different opinions on the choices of yours. This will entitle your option to be the most reasonable. Many people will look at you and appreciate your time and choice of the item you have. This can make people feel good inside and appreciate their critiques that they went through. Everyone wants to be outstanding when it comes to all of their choices. Multiple opinions and perspectives will only benefit the outcome. So, next time when you are looking for that perfect item, ask around to make sure you have only the top option.

"Dear School Board Members,

I am writing to you today to express my strong opposition to the proposed extension of daily school hours by one and a half hours. While I understand the importance of education and the need to provide students with more opportunities to learn, I believe that this proposal is not the best solution for our school community. In this essay, I will present three reasons why the school board should not extend the daily school hours by one and a half hours.

First and foremost, extending the school day by one and a half hours would have a negative impact on students' mental health and well-being. Research has shown that prolonged periods of sitting and studying can lead to decreased productivity, increased stress, and even physical health problems such as headaches and backaches. Furthermore, many students already struggle to balance their academic and extracurricular commitments, and extending the school day would only make this more challenging. By prioritizing the academic success of our students, we must also consider their overall well-being and ensure that we are providing them with the resources and support they need to succeed both inside and outside of the classroom.

Secondly, extending the school day by one and a half hours would put an undue burden on families and the community. Many families already struggle to balance work, childcare, and other responsibilities, and extending the school day would only make this more challenging. This would also put additional pressure on the community as a whole, as more families would need to rely on after-school programs and other resources to care for their children. By prioritizing the academic success of our students, we must also consider the needs and concerns of our families and the community as a whole.

Finally, extending the school day by one and a half hours would not necessarily lead to improved academic outcomes. While more time in the classroom may seem like a good solution, research has shown that the quality of instruction and the engagement of students are more important factors in academic success than the amount of time spent in the classroom. Furthermore, many students already struggle to keep up with the workload and extend the school day would only make this more challenging. By prioritizing the academic success of our students, we must focus on providing them with high-quality instruction and engaging learning experiences, rather than simply extending the school day.

In conclusion, I strongly urge the school board to reconsider the proposed extension of daily",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"I am very on board with the idea that student projects enhance learning throughout the summer , but should the student projects be chosen but the students or by teachers ?

After extensive thought I believe they should be chosen by the students , but should have a firm rubrick and expectations on how to get full credit for completion of the project.

The thought behind student projects is to help the children continue learning even throughout the summer, so you want to make the project something cool that will make all kids even with different intrest, intrested enough that they will want to complete the project. I feel like if the teachers pick what the project should be about there will still be students who are not intrested enough to even bother completing it and they will see a sharp decline in the amount of students willing to complete a student project.

Now that being said i feel that there is a fine line between school appropriate projects and projects that are not. Students should not only be provided with a sheet that gives prompt ideas and lists what does meet project guidelines as well as a list of things that will result in a loss of points on the project. There are many things a student can come up with such as a photography journal with a paragraph beside each photograph explaining the significance of the Photo , or someone who loves astronomy completing a model solar system with why each planet is suitable or not suitable for life. Give them the option the express themselves through these projects not just throw something together because they want a grade.

I can also see the other side where people say that it should be teacher chosen so that they can provide detailed expectations of how the project should be completed , but you have to see that in a class of twenty or thirty students not all students are intrested in the same things. It will make the student who is not intrested feel left out when they see other people so excited to complete a project that they are gonna wait until the last night of summer and throw something together because it is not something they like. Consider all of the different personality types ? You cant have a one size fits all project because there will always be someone who it does not actually fit .

Thank you so much for allowing me to express my opinion in this paper. I am very aware that not everyone will have the same one as me but i do hope my argument made sense .",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principle,

I agree with policy #1. I believe that students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch and other free periods because it's not like were in class. Were just eating food for 30 minutes. And the same with other free times, it's not like we're learning or supposed to be learning anything.

I've always wondered if this policy would ever be a option to the school and i hope it is because i'm really sure kids would love to be able to use their cell phones during their lunch period and other free times. And i don't think kids would abuse it and think they can use their phones whenever they want. they would respect the rule of only using it at certain times and if they didn't their would be a consequence like always. But I think it kind of is ridiculous that were not allowed to take out our cell phone while at our lunch period or other free times, i really don't see the need why we can't. As long as the students aren't using the cell phone in a way that it's not supposed to be used, i think it will go great. Or if you deside that we can't do that, maybe a week or two a month we can pay a dollar or two too use or cell phones during lunch & free times. The school would make a lot of money by doing that. I really wish you would consider doing this for us kids, and I'm sure you will not regret it.

"Praise has been widely accepted as an effective tool for motivating and increasing self-esteem in students. Through praise, adults can effectively communicate their support and show encouragement for various achievements and endeavors. Various methods of praise can be used to support students, such as verbal encouragement and affirmation, physical signs of appreciation, or educational materials to reinforce success. By recognizing and celebrating even the smallest achievements, students are empowered to strive towards higher goals with a sense of purpose.

Building self-esteem in students is important to ensure they have the confidence to pursue their life goals and develop resilience in the face of adversity. Praise acts as a form of positive reinforcement in that it gives students the recognition they need to see their progress in a positive light. This provides students with the renewed motivation to continue their journey towards success.

In conclusion, students are entitled to the support they need to foster their development. Praise is an invaluable resource in strengthening their self-belief and building morale. The continuous and sincere recognition of student successes can be an instrumental factor in motivating and inspiring them to get one step closer to achieving their dreams.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Learning over summer break is typically not ideal for students, but some classes do require it. Students procrastinate and avoid the summer projects because they want to enjoy their break, not spend it working on something for school. They do know themselves best, and therefore they should be able to design their own projects before summer to make it easier for them to do the project. I think summer projects should be student-designed to make it easier for students to get the work done and learn from it. With a bit of help from teachers, students would be able to design projects that they know would be the easiest and best way for them to learn over summer break.

Summer break is a precious time for students. They get to relax away from school, spend time with friends, and enjoy a stress-free 3 months. If they were able to design the projects they have to do over this cherished time, I can say that most of them would not avoid it as much. I believe students would not procrastinate on something they have specifically tailored for their own learning capabilities. Whenever I have a project assigned that is made by a teacher in a way that I do not learn easily through, I procrastinate on it and put off getting it done. As a student, I love summer break, and I would not want to do a project that I know I will not enjoy.

Every student learns differently. We do not receive or process information the same way. If students were to create their own projects, they would be able to make something that they know they can learn from. True, teachers can see what students struggle with and what they should be learning, but they cannot know how the student works mentally. Only the student can truly know themselves. When teachers assign projects with product options such as art, writing, acting, or others, I find it rather nice. I can choose what I know I will be able to do and get it done faster, as opposed to a project where I cannot choose what I do. This personalized learning is a much better experience for students than all students being treated like they think the same way. We are all human beings who are very different individuals.

Teachers may think they should be the ones to design these projects since they know the curriculum and have probably seen what projects seem to have worked in the the past. However, the world changes, people change, and learning should change with it. Students should be able to make projects that work just right for them, and if they have the help of a teacher to do it, then it could be just perfect. It has always been beneficial when a teacher has worked with me to help me do an assignment the way I am able to do it. Teachers could help students create these assignments to make a great learning activity each individual. Teachers know the learning material, and students know themselves. Put them together and you get a project that is not too hard, not too easy, but just right.

To conclude, I think summer projects should be student-designed to make it easier for the students to get their work done. Student-designed projects would be much easier on the students' break time, giving them the stress-free vacation they deserve, preventing them from procrastinating on their work. Along with this, no one knows a student better than themselves. We are all very different people, and with help from teachers and their knowledge of the subject, we can make a project just for ourselves that can help us really learn what we need to learn over the summer break. I think this is the best approach for summer projects, and it should be the way to go.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

I think that your first policy is a very good idea and you should go with that idea. Your second policy would just make the students very angry and make them start hating you and I'm pretty sure you don't want your students to hate you. I think that it is important for you to chose your first policy because if students didn't bring a cell phone to class and they missed the bus they would have no way of calling their parents to come pick them up and about 90% of the students don't like to go in the office and call their parents they would rather use their cell phone, another reason why your first policy is good is because your students wont hate you and they will have their phone but they will have it turned off in class and be more focused on what the teacher is teaching, and also if you took away cell phones you would have a lot of students who hate you and refuse to pay attention in class.

Missing the bus is a very average thing, at least five people a day miss the bus every day and most of those people who miss the bus don't like to go in the office and call from that phone because they are either scared you will get mad at them for missing the bus or that there will be another person there that will think them stupid for missing the bus. Most students don't have perfect grades and so some stay after school and miss their bus and calling their parents from their cell phone is a very casual thing because as soon as they get done with what they were doing in that class they can call their parents to pick them up so they get home faster. Students also like to call their parents from their cell phones to see if they can go to there friends house and that's just a faster way of calling instead of going to the office and waiting because then the friend and the person have just missed their bus. So keep the cell phones and you wont have to worry bout anyone missing their bus or too scared to come in and call from the office phone.

Your first policy states that we can have our cell phones if we only use it during lunch or our free time which is a great idea because then you will have your students focused during class and trying to have fun in that class so that they have the time fly buy and be able to text during their free time. If you take away our phones because you got us texting class, that is ok because that is totally fair because we shouldn't have ever been texting in class in the first place. So let us keep our phones and we promise not to text in class and pay attention and to only text during our free time.

Taking away our cell phones like is says to do in your second policy is a very bad idea because you will have 100% of the students hating you and a principal that has all of its students that hates them makes the school go into chaos. What I mean by that is that none of the teachers will have students willing to participate and do their work which means a lot of kids failing just because you decided to take away cell phones from the school and I'm pretty sure you don't want to run a school with a bunch of failing kids and more to come if you take away our cell phones.

So stick with your first policy and keep cell phones and we promise not to text during class and only during our free time. Going with your second policy would be a terrible thing because then you would have a bunch of students not will to participate and not having a ride home because they missed the bus and not to mention every student will hate you. So make the smart choice and keep a war off of your hands and go with your first policy.      ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" states in the last paragraph, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors,"" which means the author sides with the idea of studying Venus, even with the risks it offers.

In paragraph 5, the author gives light on NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. NASA's idea is to allow scientists to float above the fray, like a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above Venus's landscape. A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions and that the temperatures would still be warm at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. So, not easy conditions, but still survivable for humans.

The author states in the next paragraph that in order to a conduct a thorough mission to get more information on Venus, scientists would need to get up close and personal, despite the risks.

The author ends the article with ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to mee the very edges of imagination and innovation,"" which says that just because there are many dangers that come with getting to know more about Venus, doesn't mean we should avoid Venus on purpose. We should get to know more about Venus despite the dangers for our own imagination and innovation.

Studying Venus is a good start to unravel the secrets of not only our galaxy, but of the universe also, but until we have even more advanced technology and equipment, it wouldn't be the best idea to start doing missions on Venus as of now; However, the author of this article believes that we should study Venus despite the dangers that we could face to further expand what we know. The author is being more considerate of science than of safety.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the health of students in schools. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of a balanced school menu. Many students are consuming foods that are high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which can lead to a range of health problems. In this essay, I will analyze the potential benefits of providing students with a more balanced school menu in terms of overall health and longevity.

Firstly, a balanced school menu can help to reduce the risk of obesity in students. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), childhood obesity rates in the United States have tripled since the 1970s, and it is estimated that one in three children is overweight or obese. One of the main causes of childhood obesity is a diet that is high in unhealthy foods and low in nutrients. By providing students with a more balanced school menu, schools can help to reduce the risk of obesity and promote a healthier lifestyle.

Secondly, a balanced school menu can help to improve the overall health of students. A diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can provide students with the nutrients they need to grow and develop properly. It can also help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. By providing students with a more balanced school menu, schools can help to promote good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases later in life.

Thirdly, a balanced school menu can help to improve the academic performance of students. There is a growing body of research that suggests that diet plays a role in academic performance. For example, a study published in the Journal of School Health found that students who ate a healthy breakfast were more likely to perform better on standardized tests than those who did not eat breakfast. By providing students with a more balanced school menu, schools can help to improve their academic performance and set them on the path to success.

In conclusion, providing students with a more balanced school menu has the potential to bring a range of benefits in terms of overall health and longevity. By reducing the risk of obesity, improving overall health, and improving academic performance, schools can help to set their students on the path to a healthier and",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"When it comes to problem-solving, there is no substitute for doing your best. When faced with a difficult situation, our initial reaction is often to give up and accept a subpar solution. But by refusing to accept anything less than our best effort, we open ourselves up to possibilities we hadn’t considered. 

Take, for instance, the famous story of Thomas Edison’s invention of the light bulb. Despite failing thousands of times to make a functioning bulb, Edison kept pushing himself to create something that worked. His relentless dedication paid off in the form of one of most important technological inventions in history. It’s a remarkable example of the power of persistence and of doing your best to solve a problem no matter how challenging.

I experienced this firsthand when I was applying to college. During the application process, I kept running into roadblocks. It felt like I was up against an insurmountable task. But instead of giving up, I persevered until I found a solution. My willingness to put in the effort led to my acceptance into the college of my dreams.

Ultimately, doing your best to solve a problem is the only way to produce beneficial results. With determination and a lot of hard work, nearly any challenge can be overcome. So the next time you find yourself facing an obstacle, remember to stay committed and never stop striving for the best.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"This essay will have many reasons to why the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform created with the use of shadows to form what looks to be, a human face. Some people believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens or any kind of life on Mars, and NASA is trying to keep the public from knowing.

The first reason is that it has been confirmed by NASA that the human face is just an illusion! This illusion created by shadows gives it the appearance of a human face. Now some people may believe that NASA is saying that it is an illusion because they want to hide that they have been given a sign of life in space. Most people do not know that if there was life on Mars then NASA would benefit, which I will speak more about in the next paragraph.

The second reason to convince you that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform is that if there was life on Mars, it would be no secret! NASA would financially benefit from life on Mars. Think of all the publicity NASA would get and how much money that would bring to them, they could fund a lot more programs and projects.

The third reason is that we can not question the power of the technology they have at NASA. NASA has taken several looks at the face and each time the results are the same. They have extraordinary cameras and photography technology at NASA. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a mesa, most common in the American West.

Although some people might still believe that the face is not just a landform, the facts show that it is just an illusion with shadows giving the appearance of a face. I hope this essay has enlightened you to what the ""Face on Mars"", really is.      ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principal:

I truly understand you on this policy, there is many reasons why this policy should be considered. Many students love sport willing to do anything to get in the sport team. By this, I'm saying that if they have low grades they will have to try harder to get in the sport. This will not only improve there grade but will help them get higher test scores.

Many students at my school love sports and are always talking about it. Now this means that they will do whatever is possible to get in the sport which as a result they have to have higher grades. If all students are in a sport and have good grades they will be able to have a good collage application.

On the other hand many people may think that a sport is a good way to keep a student healthy and active. But if this police it given not only will they be healthy but be motivative to keep their grades higher. This will help then throw out the school year.

"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This can help them make a better choice in many different ways. Discussing decisions with different people, not only gives the decision maker multiple perspectives to think about, but it also can help them gain confidence in their decision, and give them enriching new ideas to think about. All of these resources for the decision maker, will help them to make an educated and well thought out choice. With the opinions and thoughts of many people involved in a choice, the decision maker also makes a well rounded decision, that will positively impact themselves, as well as other people.

To start, every person has something to offer, and different people have different perspectives. While making a decision, many people may become stuck in their own perspective, and receiving advice from multiple people may offer a refreshing chance to look at the situation differently. If you only take advice from one person, their perspective has less of a chance of being varied from that of yourself, than if you get advice from numerous different people. This will help the decision maker to see the decision in a different light, and this may clear up any uncertainties for them. For example, you may view a color, and be absolutely sure that it is blue. However, if you ask another person, they may be certain that the same color is actually green. This shows, that different people can view the same situation in a different way. Furthermore, speaking with more than just one person, may help you to get an understanding of how the decision may have repercussions on other people, instead of just thinking about yourself. Hearing these different perspectives, may convince the decision maker to make a better choice, than if they had just spoken to one person.

Subsequently, seeking advice from more than one person, may help the decision maker to feel more confident about their decision. While speaking to other people, they may find that a good number of people feel the same way that they do about their choice. This will help them to feel more confident in their good decision, and they will be less likely to change their mind. An example of this same concept is in science experiments. In a science experiment, scientists always run multiple trials of the same experiment. This is so that they feel confident about their results. This is the same idea as having multiple people who have the same opinion as you do; you feel more confident about your resulting choice. If a scientist does not get matching results, then they feel that their results are invalid, and they run the experiment again. This is the same as if you do not find people who have the same opinion as you, and you rethink your decision. If you thought you had made up your mind, and then you speak to more people who have different opinions, you are more likely to rethink your choice. This will help you make sure that you are truly making the best choice for yourself.

Finally, the ideas of other people may help you to formulate your own. While everyone has their own perspective to give, they also have their own ideas. Everybody brings something new to the table, and if you talk to more people, you can hear more ideas. These ideas may convince you to think a certain way about your choice, or they may help you unlock some of your own ideas. Either a new opinion, or a new idea, may be exactly what a decision maker needs to finalize their decision, or make a completely new choice. These new ideas, may also help the decision maker to understand the decision at hand, in a more fundamental way, which will help them to understand the impact of their choices. This, can lead to a carefully made choice.

In conclusion, seeking the advice of numerous people offers many thoughtful benefits that lead the decision maker to the best possible decision. New and different perspectives on a specific decision, will help the decision maker to understand how the decision may not only affect them, but how it will also affect other people. This may also help the decision maker to get out of their head, and look at the situation from a different angle. Hearing opinions from numerous people, may also help you gain confidence in your decision, and if it does not, you will know that you may need to give your choice more thought. Finally, every new person that you speak to, will give you more ideas that may influence your decision. These ideas may shape your decision in ways that you never would have thought about, had you not spoken to more than one person. These ideas and opinions also may give you a new sense of clarity over your choice. Overall, seeking the advice of multiple people, instead of just one, will help decision makers to make choices that are well thought out, thoroughly planned, and best for not only themselves, but for other people as well. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Gas prices. Car notes. Parking fines. These are all expensive things you have to pay for when you consider owning a car. Most family get rid of their cars because of having to pay these high prices in order to keep their cars.

There are a couple of car free cities;for example German Suburbs is car free because of expensive fees they would have to pay just to have a space to park in,.""but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space,for $40,000,along with a home.""These families would have to spend $40,000 along just to park their car in a large garage,it makes it easy for them to make the decision not to own a car because prices are so high. Having to buy a parking space for that much and still having to buy a home along with the $40,000 can cause a lot of stress on family providers because they have to basically spend all their money on one high priced item;a CAR!

"As students get older they start not wanting to go to school so, some schools started offering online video conferencing as a alternative for this problem. Therefore, some might say that video online conferencing would help students because they can learn from home. But, students would not actually benefit from online video conferencing because the lack of physical interaction and the distractions at home.

If students started to do online video conferencing, they would lack physical interaction. Some people might think that this is great for the shy students. But, if the teacher is not present the students wouldn't ask questions and the teacher wouldn't be able to physically help them with a problem. Also, the students wouldn't have one on one time with the teacher. Students need one on one time with the teacher so they can understand what they are learning and so that the teacher can help them individually. Furthermore, students need hands on learning. Hands on learning is important because it gives the students a general idea what the actual work is like so they can learn it and understand it better.

Additionally, students would be distracted by the activities and objects at home. Students would not pay attention to what they are learning if they are on their phones. Student are always on their phones, they text and check social media everyday. The teacher would not be able to punish them if they are on their phones during a lecture or while the teacher is teaching a lesson because the student is not physically there. The students would also be distracted by their parents. Their parents could be a distraction by interrupting the student while in a lesson. The parents could ask the student to do chores like: take out the trash, do the dishes, or even take the dog on a walk. Furthermore, students would get distracted by their pets. Pets are very unpredictable so, the student doesn't know what the pet is going to do. The pet could make a mess or just be really noisy. Pets would take the attention away from the lesson the teacher is trying to teach.

Students shouldn't start doing online video conferencing. Students should go to school and have physical interactions with other students and teachers with less distractions. Schools should step into another direction to make students want to go to school again. The Department of Education should act now to bring students to their facilities.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"As the debate over school schedules continues to be an ongoing issue, an innovative idea has been proposed: reduce the number of school days from five to four, and increase the length of each day to two extra hours. While this idea has drawn both support and criticism, there are many valid arguments in favor of the four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day. 

First, a four-day school week would reduce stress by allowing students, teachers and staff more time to socialize, participate in extra-curricular activities, or pursue hobbies. The extra two hours per day would also allow teachers to dig deeper into their subjects and help students stay engaged and focused. Furthermore, a four-day school week would provide an economic benefit, as schools would need fewer personnel to clean and maintain the buildings. Plus, this would give families a bit of a break when it comes to childcare responsibilities, as they could use those days to plan activities, run errands, or simply get some much-needed rest. 

Ultimately, a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day would be beneficial for everyone involved. Students would have fewer days to feel anxious and overwhelmed, while still having the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the subjects they are studying. Additionally, the cost savings for schools would be a welcome bonus. In short, moving to a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day represents an innovative way of ensuring students receive a quality education while reducing stress and providing a cost-effective solution for schools.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Dear Senator I am not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. We should not keep the Electoral College for many reasons. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was abolishing the Electoral College. Another reason being, under the Electoral College System, voters vote for a slate of electors, not the president and in return they select the president. Last but not least, the Electoral College is unfair to voters.

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was aboloshing the Electoral College. This was also agreed upon by many other citizens. According to a Gallup Poll in 2000, which was taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the popular vote. According to the poll ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election not  the kind we have now."" It is said that ""this year voters are to expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again loose the presidency.""

Under the Electoral College System, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. Because of this there are so many questions asked that are answered very broadly due to the fact you do not really know the correct answer. For instace, who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding the public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, Sometimes the  State Party's central comittee, and sometimes the presidential canidates themselves.

Man oh man is the Electoral College unfair to voters! This may be an opinion, but it is on of many citizens who are all in agreement of it."" All of the ""winner-takes-all"" systems in each state, canidates do not spend time in each states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" In fact in the 2000 campaing there were seventeen states the did not see the canidates at all and it was said that voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not even get to see a single campaign ad. "" if anyone has a good arguement for putting he fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in ohio, they have yet to make it....""

"So our principal has made a new rule that everyone must do an extracurricular activity. This is debated by people. Do these extracurricular activities benefit kids?

I agree with my prinicipal. This is a great idea, a healthy way of school for students. The students get to meet new people and possibly make new friends, and if they join a club or a team with their friends they can play with them. For sports they get to work together as a team and do their best. For clubs they can solve issues or help out the school with things like the yearbook club and student council. These clubs and sports teams are very fun with friends and meeting new people and making friends is even better!

This also gives something for students to do. Instead of going home and immedietly playing video games or waiting for the weekend this gives students an opportunity to do something after school instead of going home and getting bored. This also makes students more social and talkative. By having to work with new people and building relationships with people and this is where you make new friends! By having good social skills and being able to be coached or cabable of working with others helps you get known as a fun person to play or work with in clubs. Also if you are good at it it's even better!

This can also help the school. With clubs this can help the school get things done like the yearbook and the student council can make decisions on what to move forward with. Sports can help raise money for the school with fundraisers, and their success might help too. This also helps the school improve by solving problems like fixing broken items or getting jerrseys etc. When the school doesn't have many problems than everyone is ok and nobody is unhappy with the school

Having after school activities is good. This helps kids and helps the school. Kids get tthe opportunity to make friends, play fun sports and help the school. This benefits lots of people and will make people happy.                                                             ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear principle,

You should require all students to perform community service because not only does it protect the environment it protects future generations and our community. For example say people were not taking care of the environment and throwing their garbage and littering in our rivers and streams, which leads to our drink water it would then be contaminated and the contamination of the water wouldn't just effect humans it would effect plants and animals as well. Or say that we were not recycling, all of our garbage would do straight to landfill's which would once again put humans, plants and animals in danger. Or perhaps we were letting the oil from our cars run out into streams and driving our car to places that we could easily walk to or letting the carbon monoxide from our cars pollute the air leaving more of a chance for global warming to happen.

All of this can be prevented if we just take thirty minutes out of our day and pick up loose trash in our neighborhood or park or just as simple as recycling plastics, papers, cardboards, glasses etc. Also students want have to worry about taking time away from hanging out with their friends because their friends can do it with them and they would be getting more done in half of the time. This plan will work if you put it into action and I strongly hope you take my request into recommendation.

"Positive Attitude: The Key to Success in Life

Having a positive attitude is an essential component of achieving success in life. It is often said that our thoughts and beliefs shape our reality, and this is particularly true when it comes to our attitude towards life. A positive attitude allows us to approach challenges with optimism, resilience, and determination, which ultimately leads to greater success.

One of the main arguments in favor of a positive attitude is that it allows us to focus on the possibilities rather than the limitations. When we have a positive outlook, we tend to see opportunities where others see only obstacles. This mindset enables us to take risks, pursue our goals, and achieve our full potential. For example, a person with a positive attitude may be more likely to start a business, pursue a new career, or take up a new hobby.

Another argument in favor of a positive attitude is that it helps us to overcome adversity. Life is full of challenges and setbacks, and having a positive attitude can help us to cope with these difficulties. When we are optimistic, we tend to view setbacks as temporary obstacles rather than permanent failures. This mindset enables us to learn from our mistakes, persevere through hard times, and emerge stronger and more resilient.

However, there are also competing points of view that challenge the idea that having a positive attitude is the key to success. Some argue that other factors, such as hard work, determination, and intelligence, are more important than having a positive attitude. While these factors are undoubtedly important, it is difficult to deny that having a positive attitude can provide a significant boost to our success.

Additionally, some argue that having a positive attitude can be detrimental to our success. For example, being too optimistic can lead to complacency and a lack of motivation to work hard. Similarly, being too resilient can lead to a lack of accountability and a failure to recognize when we need to make changes or seek help.

In conclusion, while there are certainly competing points of view on the role of a positive attitude in achieving success, it is difficult to deny that having a positive attitude can provide a significant boost to our success. By focusing on the possibilities, overcoming adversity, and maintaining a sense of optimism, we can achieve our full potential and live a more fulfilling life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

"If you had to make a choice between going to school or attending class from home, which would you choose? As time passes, this question will continue to be asked to students more and more. The number of students that have begun learning from home keeps increasing. Will we abandon our established educational system in search of a better one? Everyone has their own thoughts and opinions regarding this matter, but who is correct? One thing is for certain, no one knows what will happen. But, based on the facts that are available right now, we can assume that attending classes from home is very beneficial. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would be able to work at their own pace and it would lead to an improved sleep schedule.

A benefit of being able to attend classes from home is that it enables students to be able to work at their own pace. For students who understand new concepts relatively fast, there would no longer be a reason to endure the hassle of having to wait for fellow classmates to catch up. Students who need more time would be able to learn at their own pace without having other students make them feel bad for taking too long. Allowing students to work at their own pace could also lead to a decrease in the possibility to lose focus. When students are put into a classroom with other students, who work at a completely different pace, it can get difficult. Having to constantly put a stop to your learning or having no time to take a mental break because you are behind can make students lose focus. Learning from home provides students with the opportunity to take breaks and to be more focused. Being more focus is something very positive that could easily be improved by doing things like having a good sleeping schedule.

Having a better sleep schedule is another benefit of attending classes from home. A better sleep schedule is extremely beneficial to students. Not having to wake up early to go to school would allow students to sleep more. It is common knowledge that one of the most debated topics regarding schools is what time schools should start. Extensive research has shown that students would function better if school started later. Giving students the option to learn from home and wake up later would benefit them by allowing them to be more focus which would lead to them being more productive. Another reason as to why waking up early does not work is because students often have to complete assignments that require a lot of time. They go to sleep late to complete them on time. Going to sleep late and then having to wake up early is unhealthy. Attending classes from home would increase the time students have on their hands so they would be able to complete assignments faster. Combining these two together, we are able to see how drastically the sleep schedule of a student can improve. Although, there are many positives with attending classes from home, people are always going to find negatives.

A negative that people would argue for is that attending classes from home wouldn't work because there is no real interaction between the student and the instructor. They would argue that students would not be able to ask for help. This sounds like very reasonable remark but they can easily be proven wrong. If a student ever needs extra help or just wants to ask a few questions they could always schedule a conference, via video calling, with their instructor. Another way that a student can have his or her question answered is by simple looking it up online. Nowadays there are so many different websites and

YouTube videos that can be easily found regarding any subject. Students would have all the help they could need!

In conclusion, students would benefit from attending classes from home because their sleeping schedule would improve and they can work at their own pace. Not having to go to sleep late or wake up early would make it easier for students to have a more consistent and healthy sleep schedule. Decreasing the amount of distractions and not having to work at the rhythm of other classmates would make it possible for students to work at their own pace. These two combined would be sufficient evidence as to why students would benefit from attending classes from home. So, what would you do? ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"It is crucial to understand that our behavior can greatly influence the actions of those around us. This is especially true when it comes to children, who may look up to adults and imitate their behavior. Modeling bad behavior can lead to a wide array of consequences, from difficulty adhering to societal norms to potentially having a bad record, especially when it comes to attempting to travel abroad. Therefore, it is vital to educate children on the value of good behavior so they can make positive contributions to society and live up to their potential. Educating children on good behavior can also benefit the surrounding communities, as it promotes a better understanding of cultural norms and responsibilities and encourages positive interactions between people. It is important to remember that how we act can have a direct impact on the development of future generations.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"""The Search For Venus""

Venus is know as a planet, sometimes called the ""Evening Star"". It's even called the earths twin because both Earth and Venus have the closest terms of density and size. even sometimes closests in distance, but scientist have to realise the danders of Venus, ""its proven a very challenging place to examine more closely"" reasons why is because due to the thick atmosphere of 97 percent which is carbon dioxide that blankets Venus.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), is planning to send humans to study Venus and learn more about it.

There soultion for them to be able to do this is that due to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray, example like they said ""imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the landscape."" which what they would be doing if they were to float above it. The only bad thing about what they are trying to do, is the dangerous conditions.

Its far more extreme than what any human has encountered on Earth. Reasons why is because Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in it's atmosphere. It's temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

It would be best for scientists to study more on the planet of Venus and on how the atmosphere works, and how we can adapt to it'senviorment if we can even adapt to it with out anything bad happening. Which we do have the technology to do all this, but it will take time to make sure everything should be how it should be so that things are capable of the planets atmosphere, like a rocket ship that could be launched to Venus.

Like for example if NASA just built a rocket ship and launched it to Venus without knowing the outcome it could end bad. Reasoning to this because they might not have knew the temperature of the planet, or maybe not even know what the atmosphere is capable of doing to the ship or the humans if they were to go on a mission. It took years to study Mars, and NASA is still finding stuff out about Mars to this day.

They said ""just exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin."" What they are saying is that if we do not study Venus enough a mission could go really bad which will no be good nor NASA. Due to what we didn't know about the planet. Just sending out a ship to Venus with out not knowing what can happen would never be a good idea, better safe than sorry.

The author is right about his ideas that studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite what could happen, because they can take the time to study more and more and figure what the planet is like, no matter how long it might take to reach the planet and get to get up closer to the planet wihtout anything going wrong.

Not every planet is the same, and why isbecause how the solar system works. Like Mercury its closest to the sun and the planet is not capable of having life living on it due to how hot it is. So it's a good idea for scientists to study the plants before just making a mission to Venus.         ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Extending student release time can have a vast impact on a variety of aspects associated with a school. From a student well-being perspective, extra time available can give students the opportunity to engage in activities and leisure which could potentially help mitigate stress and improve academic and mental performance. Additionally, the extra time might also offer parents more flexibility when it comes to their own work and personal obligations. On the other hand, increased release time could present new challenges in terms of after-school transportation, as schools and families may need to adjust their schedules towards the new reality of later release times. Ultimately, the extent of these implications will depend on the type and magnitude of the modification in student release time.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"""What it that? How did it get there? Will we be attacked by marshans?"" Yes, these are the questions that a lot of people asked NASA when they found an interesting photo on Mars. The picture is supposedly a ""face"", but to astronomers, it is just a rock formation.

Hundereds of people think that there was a human head on Mars, but from what astronomers had to say about it, it was the truth. In 1976, NASA got their first look at the ""face"" on Mars. A couple days later NASA relased the image of the ""face"" to the public the caption was simple as it states in the text, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" After that, it was a pop icon, attracting people into learning more about this planet.

The ""Face on Mars"" became very popular when it came to scaring humans. According to the text it states ""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" In films, as always, Hollywood would ""tweak"" the truth to have more people come and see the movie. This was partly the cause of people believing that there is life on mars. However, astronomers are saying that there could have been life on Mars because, of dry river and lake beds on the surface of The Red Planet. Still, that does not prove that there were marshans.

Astronomers are still trying to convince people that there is not life on Mars. According to the text it states ""What the picture actually shows ins the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" This is showing what it really looks like. Besides, from background knowledge it is not possible for a human to live on Mars. There is no oxygen for us to breathe, no water, and no food. Nothing.

Technology has advanced in the past 25 years, showing us clearer pictures in space. This is incuding the ""face"" on Mars. It will forever be a mystery, but from what astronomers have said it will always be a rock formation.                        ",0,persuade_corpus,1

Students at out school have been informed you would like to change the school policy of participation of playing sports while maintaining a B average.

I agree completely with your consideration of the new rule.

It would be a very smart idea, helping students keeping their grade up as an incentive for them to play the sport of their choice.

Requiring students maintaining a B grade average to play sports is a great idea.

It is an incentive for the athletes to play the sport they love, while representing our school at the same time.

It teaches kids that in order to do something they love, there might be something they need to do to earn there way into the sports they would like to play.

It also is a good idea because they will be getting good grades.

Getting a job later in life is a good incentive for student too.

While getting an education, you get good records and good grades.

It all can be used for your future.

Because you can get a better job and a good college scholarship for sports, just because you were aloud to play that one year of middle school or high school.

One reason it may be not so good is because basketball, or baseball, or track, or any sport is really good exercise for people. If you limit the kids being able to play, it limits your team, and it lessens the fitness for those kids.

I hope you consider my letter as being a good choice for your school.

It definitely helps grades, and futures for kids.

"Imagination is a powerful tool that can be used to unlock limitless knowledge and drive creativity. Drawing from practical examples from everyday life, inventions in our modern world, and educational stories, this essay will show why it is important to use imagination in knowledge. 

First, imagination allows us to think creatively and find solutions to existing problems. In everyday life, we utilize our creative thinking skills to help us plan for the future and solve everyday issues. For example, when faced with the dilemma of a limited budget to furnish a room, one might use their imagination to think of more cost-effective alternatives, such as purchasing furniture from second-hand stores or repurposing already owned materials.

Second, imagination is an essential component in modern inventions. For example, engineers use imagination to construct inventions that revolutionize the world. Many of the modern inventions we find today, such as the iPhone, couldn't have been created without engineers using their imagination to dream of a better future. 

Finally, imagination is used in educational stories to teach lessons that can be applied to real life scenarios. For example, by using vivid imagery and imaginative characters, stories allow the reader to put themselves in the character’s shoes, empathize with them, and learn lessons on how to best traverse a problem. In this way, stories can successfully use imagination to teach strong lessons that can be applied to real life. 

In summary, imagination has proven to be an essential component in everyday life, modern inventions, and educational stories. By using imagination, we have been able to find creative solutions, build revolutionary inventions, and learn important lessons from educational stories. Therefore, it is important to use imagination in knowledge.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is important to always give yourself a chance to succeed and why failure should lead to a second chance. It is easy to get discouraged when we fail, but we must remember that failure is not the end of the road. Instead, it is a stepping stone towards success.

Giving yourself a chance to succeed means taking risks and trying new things. It means stepping out of your comfort zone and challenging yourself to be better. For example, if you have always struggled with math, don't give up. Instead, seek help from a teacher or tutor and keep trying. You may be surprised at how much you can improve.

Additionally, failure can teach us valuable lessons. When we fail, we learn what went wrong and how we can improve. This knowledge can help us succeed in the future. For instance, if you failed a test, you can review the material and identify areas where you need to improve. This will help you do better on future tests.

Furthermore, failure can also lead to a second chance. It can be a wake-up call that motivates us to work harder and be more determined. For example, if you didn't get into your top college, don't give up on your dreams. Instead, apply to other colleges and work hard to improve your grades. You may still get into your top college, or you may find a new school that is a better fit for you.

In conclusion, it is important to always give yourself a chance to succeed and why failure should lead to a second chance. Failure is not the end of the road, but a stepping stone towards success. It can teach us valuable lessons and lead to a second chance. So, don't give up on your dreams, keep trying, and never give up on yourself.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Self-reliance is a crucial aspect of a person's life, and it can help individuals feel secure when making decisions. Self-reliance refers to the ability to rely on oneself for support and guidance, rather than relying on others. In this essay, I will analyze how self-reliance can help people feel secure when taking decisions and determine what matters in life.

Firstly, self-reliance can help individuals feel secure when making decisions because it allows them to trust their own instincts and beliefs. When people are self-reliant, they are able to make decisions based on their own values and principles, rather than being swayed by the opinions of others. This can be especially important when making decisions that have long-term consequences, such as choosing a career path or starting a family.

Secondly, self-reliance can help individuals feel secure when taking decisions because it allows them to take responsibility for their choices. When people are self-reliant, they are able to take ownership of their decisions and the outcomes of those decisions. This can help them feel more confident in their choices and more in control of their lives.

Thirdly, self-reliance can help individuals feel secure when making decisions because it allows them to focus on what truly matters in life. When people are self-reliant, they are able to prioritize their own needs and values, rather than being influenced by external factors such as societal expectations or the opinions of others. This can help them live a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

In conclusion, self-reliance can help individuals feel secure when making decisions by allowing them to trust their own instincts and beliefs, take responsibility for their choices, and focus on what truly matters in life. By cultivating self-reliance, individuals can gain a sense of confidence and control over their lives, which can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful existence.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"In my opinion, driverless cars would be extremely dangerous in certain situations. Especially with teenagers drivers. This invention could have a very bad outcome. Cars without drivers is pointless to me. How will cars know where to go how to get there? How will they be able to detect when there is a pedestrian trying to cross? Driving should not be made easier for our community because it is a part of everyday life.

Citizens will only become lazier and have no urge or motivation to not only drive but all other natural things. A car that drives it self will only make our country worse no better. It is cool when we see cars driving themselves in movie and on television, but is it really worth it? There are many pros and cons of this particular topic. Prod are there would be a lower rate of deaths and car related injuries because not many people would be driving. As citizens we also have to think about the small percent on people that could possibly be driving. What if a car without a driver had a malfunction and went out of control. I think the result of this situation could be far more dangerous than two drivers colliding.

As a teenager working to get my listens and start driving, cars that drive themselves are not very smart. I think driverless cars is just another way of asking for more conflict and death rates in our country. inbelieve the industry is trying to make electronics too much like humans.

"Dear State Senator

Should the Electoral College be kept in favor? The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections. Well on the other hand, Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole agreed to abolish the elctoral college and change to election by popular vote for the president of the U.S.It is unfair to the voters because the electors elect the president. Also, not only are the voters voting for electors,they are voting for the canidate's electors when they think they're voting for the canidate. Choosing a president should be elected by the popular vote of people not electors.

To start with,the president of the United States should be elected by the popular vote of the people. The president is there to guide and lead the people. The citizens of the U.S should have the right to vote for who they think should be president. For instance,some residents have a feeling that their votes don't count.

To add,it is unfair to the voters because the elctors elect the the president. Eventhough the electors represent your state,they don't let the people choos who they desire for president. When voting for president, it shouldn't be all about the electors. The Electoral College even has the possibility of turning voters away that voted for a canidate that has no hope for supporting their state.

Further more,the electoral college does avoid problems. Meaning,a canidate cannot receives a certain amount of the votes cast. For instance, when a canidate has more votes than other canidates while not receiving a clear majority oof votes.

Dear Mr. Principal,

I believe that students should not be required to do community service. It is their choice. If they want to, they should but you can not force them to do so. I also believe that you should only make students who have gotten in trouble or been bad to do community service as punishment if you want to. This will help the community and make them learn their lesson. For an illustration, if a girl or a guy gets into trouble instead of giving them detention, just make them help out the world by doing some community service. This explains that it will benefit you and your world. This also illustrates that this punishment is better because in detention, you do nothing and just keep quiet but with this, they actually do something which would make them very sore and make them never want to do it again. I believe that detention rate might go down because of this. Time is very valuable which is why community service should be a choice.

People who do community services for free I believe should feel happy with themselves and shouldn't care what other people thinks. For a demonstration, if you have done something good and you friend told that it was a waist of time, you shouldn't care what they think. This explains that if you don't care, they might stop since people will stop if you show no reaction. This also explains that people can feel happy with what they do no matter what. This is why people shouldn't care about how people judges them.

Dear principle,

Community service should be a job, not for students to perform. Requiring students to do that job is very difficult, especially during school days. Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who don't have jobs. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. So that will hurt the student from both ways. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service. And if the community needs some help as stated; take them in a specific day during school. But if it's everyday, community service jobs should be announced. That way students have some time and also learn community service during school.

"Today in this essay, im going to tell you why we should us this on students. The should also use them on not only on the students, This new technology should be used on the teachers and staff as well.

The main reason i believe this should be used in schools, is to see how the students reaction is the they way teachers are teaching them. Think about it. If most of the students are 80 percent bored, 10 percent happy, and 10 percent angry because they aren't learning in a way they should in schools then, it might be time for change. The teachers should expirement with this new age technology. As they try to change there teaching style, they can use the facial reconizion to see if most student like they way he or she is teaching. If this were to be in schools then, the studend could be more like Mona Lisa, 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted 6 percent ferful and 2 percent angry.

Not only should the students have to use it, the teachers should have to use it as well. Some people might wonder "" Why would the teachers have to use it, they aren't the ones learning?"" Ill tell you why they should have to us this facial emotion dector. If the teachers are grumpy all the time or, if they aren't happy at there carrer, they need fired. Now tell me this. If the teachers are always mad and hate there job, how do you expect the students to learn if the teacher is mad all the time. They'll just throw a paper at them and tell them to work. With this new equipment, you can use it to see if a teacher is happy. You can see if the teacher can make the class fun so the students will be happy.

In conclusion, I believe that the emothion reader should be in schools. This should be used not only for the students but, for the teachers as well.

"Dear Obviously Desperate For Help Principal,

There are many students with cell phones in school. They text in class, in the hallways, and at lunch. They're not allowed to text, yet they do. It's a way of communication in school, that cannot be stifled by teachers, as the teachers cannot hear their conversation. I myself do not have a cell phone, but many of my friends do. They set up meetings, tell their parents when to pick them up, and help each other with their homework through their phones. The current policy states that students may not be seen with a cell phone any time of the day at school. However, at the high school, students can use their phones in between classes, and at lunch. I believe that this policy is the better one.

In between classes, the child might not even be in school. Their use of cell phones doesn't interrupt class, it doesn't make a lot of noise, and it doesn't make anyone look stupid. It's a quiet way for students across the building from one another to communicate. At the high school, students may text in between classes. This gives them a time when they can communicate with friends and parents without directly talking to the person in question. The temptation of texting during class would go un-satiated if the students weren't able to use the phones in the halls. It would become too great for them, and they would text during class. However, if students were able to text in the halls, they could carry on conversations throughout the day, without interrupting the learning process.

Using cell phones is a way to communicate. Most students have a cell phone, and are able to arrange things through it. It's an important way for children to talk to other people who may or may not be in the immediate vicinity. It's quieter than talking, and less disrupting than passing notes. Students need to be able to communicate in an un-stifled way. Cell phones are the way to do that.

"The Electoral College was a system thought up by people who lived in a time much different than our own. And in that time, it made sense. It made sure that those who cast their state's votes for president, the electors, were well informed on the issues and the stance of the candidates for those issues. However, now that everyone has access to a wealth of information through the internet, newspapers and television, this is no longer a problem; this is why election by popular vote would be a better system.

With the Electoral College, voters don't have a direct say on who becomes president. They have to trust their votes in the hands of people they don't even know. People who could cast their state's votes for any candidate they want. This system is completely unnecessary now that citizens have a wealth of information about the candidates and their stance on certain topics.

If our nation switched to election by popular vote, everyone's vote would matter. In the Electoral College system, many people in states that are decisively one way or the other, don't vote, knowing that the overwhelming majority of the population of their state is against them. This makes certain people, like Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California, feel that their vote has no power. In an election by popular vote however, every vote matters because the people's votes directly decide the president.

Our Founding Fathers were geniuses to have come up with a system that worked so well in their time, however, old methods don't always stand the test of time. Election by popular vote makes more sense in today's world.  The Electoral College eliminates the power of some people's votes and puts those that matter in the hands of people who could do whatever they want with them. This is why election by popular vote would be a better system for determining the president than the Electoral College.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3

So, like, have you ever wondered why people love playing basketball so much? 🤔 Like, seriously, why do people find it so enjoyable? 🤷‍♀️ Well, let me tell you, it's not just because it's a fun game to play with your friends or because you can score some sick dunks and slam dunks (although, let's be real, those are pretty cool). 😎 Nope, there's more to it than that! 🤔

First of all, playing basketball can be super addictive! 😳 Like, once you start playing, you can't stop! 😅 You get this rush of adrenaline and endorphins when you make a sick shot or dribble past someone, and it's like, ""Oh, man, I gotta keep playing!"" 😅 It's like a rollercoaster of emotions, and you can't help but want more! 🎢 And let's be real, who doesn't love a good challenge? 💪

"Do you believe in aliens? In 1976 the Viking 1 spacecraft of NASA discovered an eery landform that looks like a human face! Some people mainly conspiracy theorist believe it is a sign of extraterestial life on Mars. While scientists like me are finding more and more reasons to explain this strange phenomenom. Today I am only going to explain a few.

The first reason why this ""face"" should be considered a landform and not a sign of life is because it is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. the facial features: eyes, nose, and mouth are an optical illusion. The reason you see a resemblance of a human face is because the rock casted a shadow of one.

Another reason you should consider this a natural landform is because, these type of landforms are common in the US. An example of these types of landforms is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.

However some alien conspiratists believe that there might have been a chance of alien life. The reason they thought this was because on the second picture the clouds could have been blocking some form of alien markings or monuments. But there weren't any on the third more clearer photograph.

So in conclusion the ""face"" on Mars was a natural landform. It is classified a landform because it is a rock formation. Also, because these types of landforms are common in the US. It should not be classified as a sign of life on other planets becausethere were no alien marking and it is an optical ollusion.             ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"I think attend class from home, is a good idea take at home. Because at home you have all the time you need to finish,and also we can have more benefit at home,some time you need more time to finish it. Attend class is good idea take at schools too, because the teacher need to explain you what you need to do. Both have benfit school and home; At the school you can learn more then the house, beacuse if you don't undertand simething you can ask to the teacher and sometime your friends or students from others huose talk to allowed you can't consentrate. Thas one reason, another reason is, maybe you don't have all the time you need, couse some time you need think about the question or something you lost a lot time in that, and sometimes the question come a litter bit hard you need think more to answer that question. Some students are so annoyoing for example they don't listen what the teacher said or they don't paid attention,when my teacher say something we have to do it, because we are in the class for learn somethibg new like world new or something like that,

Attend class are really important, beacuse is for educatuion and you are in High school you need paid attention all the time. Hawever, some student have a lot problemn from the school, beacuse they don't go to the school and have a lot marked aucent that is a big problem if u don't come to the school every day,When you are sick you can have an excuse, you can bring a card singnature for yours parents or grande. A example I need to come every day to the school, beacuse my dream is graduate of High school. Thas why i need to come every day at the school. Some students doesn't like come to the school, cause they are lazy they don't need what I need. My dreas is graduate of High school after High school, I need find a jod, and support my family and also i want go to college. Attend for me mean have education. For example help people who don't have money to buy food and who don't have a house we can help then, how to find a house where they can live; The teacher need soppurt all the students she/He have. We need paid attention all the time, because that is very importan for you future .

Also, ettend classes from home for me mean, disipline,education education is for all rest of your life. That is so important for me and my parents and for others stuadents and parents. You can m,ake a video online for attend class, because you need pass all the Esol well you need, for graduate.

"We should not keep the Electoral college because; first, it's unfair, and also, it can quickly turn into a disater.

To begin with, the Electoral college is an unfair system. In

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , "" Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.""[Plumer, p10].When voters vote for the Electoral college the person they put in might not even vote for who the people want for the President. The system is not only unfair when people vote, also when campagins happen in states. In paragraph 13 of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , the author states ""Because of the winner-takes-all system... candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."". With this system, we have some states that are left out of the campaign of candidates going through states, because they are not important to the candidate for winning.

In addition, not only is the Electoral college unfair, the system can fail at any given election. Plumer wrote in paragraph 11 ""...what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress."" the Electoral college is only to have one slate of electors from each state. With two slates from one state it would give both the state and the candidate an advantage over the rest of the states and the other candidate, that would turn into a disater. Not only can the states destory the Electoral college system, the system can destory itself.  Included in paragraph 12, "" The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe."". Even the people put into the college can ruin themselves by one or two electoral voters changing their minds.

Not everything about the Electoral college is bad. The article

Even the other vote systems are strongly disliked. The Electoral system is not the most disliked system but it can also get the President everyone wants. In paragraph 19,""... a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."". A candidate for the president can't focus on one region, because it will make other states feel that they are not important.

Principal,

I think that students should be required to perform community service. My friends and I agree that community service is very important. It is a good way to be a part of the local community and show your support for it.

Some students really enjoy service projects around the community. However, other students don't have as much free time as others because they are involved in other activities, such as sports or music. To solve this problem, I think only a small amount of community service should be required. This amount might be around 2 hours per semester or whatever you think best. If the students wish to perform extra community service, there might be a special prize for them (such as a certificate, trophy, or gift) or small academic exemptions since they went above and beyond the standard requirement.

Please strongly consider this suggestion. Please think of community service as a way to make our school more strongly tied in the community and more excellent.

Sincerely,

"You would think attending classes from home would be beneficial for a kid, and it could be, by having the freedom to learn at home and being in a place that is suitable for you. But learning from home has it's downsides. Many people believe that kids who attend class from home miss out on fun opportunities, things at home will distract the kid from learning, and kids who stay in school are more hands on than kids who learn from home. Why students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home is the fact that is too distracting and less hands on compared to going to school.

Me being a student myself, I would say having the choice of having distance learning is tempting, but I know it would not benefit me in a good way. When you are in an environment that you are comfortable in, you tend to become lazy, not as motivated, and you start to slack off when you constantly have work to do that you don't want to do. For example, I have an online course that I have to take to graduate high school which I take at home. Usually, I don't feel like doing it so I search the answers online to finish my work. Kids now have technology that could help them with the work they don't want to do or even distract them from doing their work.

Having someone physically present with you when you need help with a question you don't know is something a student who attends classes from home doesn't have the ability to get. Distance learning students attend class from home by video conferencing, which means everything they do is from a video chat with a teacher, but students who stay in school has a teacher to physically be with them to provide help and answer any questions they need. This shows that students who video chat with their teacher have a hard time showing the teacher their work they have done but students who go to school just has raise their hand and there would be on the way to see it.

Students who go to school get more experience then kids who attend classes from home. Some classes at school has certain equipment that costs a lot of money that not a lot of people can afford. How would you think a student from distance learning could get those things? they don't. The kids from distance learning don't experience those things at all, but kids who go to school get to experience, touch, and test out those things. Students who attend school from home miss out on opportunities they would get if they just attended school.

Students who go to school gets the reassurance they need from teachers, the hands on experience, and the ability to learn things without the unneeded distractions they have at home unlike students who attend class from home who experience the exact opposite. Why would you stay at home and have distractions interrupt your learning?

Students who attend classes from home would not benefit as much as kids who attend school.        ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principle,

I have heard you have been considering a new cell phone policy. Cell phones at school are not only used as communication between friends but also for other reasons. Most kids do want to use cell phones for the sole purpose of communicating between friends outside and inside the classroom. However there is always the exception. There are also many other students that use their cell phones for the purpose of contacting their parents and letting them know about important information about the day.

For this reason I am suggesting accepting the first cell phone policy where students can still use their cell phones at the appropriate time.

First there are the unexpected events that occur throughout day to day. For a child who gets picked up daily by their parents, if an event occurs that restricts the parent from picking up their child that day the parent needs to contact their child and let them know about the situation. Usually the parent will call the school and have them let their child know about the change in events but the child is not always informed. Most parents will still call their child as a precaution because they want to make sure that their child is up to date about the situation.

Next there is a change in a school event that a student planned to attend. If there was an after school activity or program going on that a student planned to attend, but got changed due to various reasons, that student would need a way to contact their parent or legal guardian to come pick them up. These change in events can happen frequently due to weather, or other events that restrict the ability to have that certain event.

Lastly is for the purpose of communicating between friends. Cell phones are not an essential but can help student relieve stress and pressure from the school day. I understand about not letting them have cell phones in the classroom but there should be no problem for usage of the item outside the classroom. Many students want to have some sort of entertainment to occupy them when needed. This policy will let students have that entertainment and still focus on school work.

All in all, cell phones can be used for many different reasons during a school day. If its from unexpected events to just plain entertainment, cell phones serve a purpose in today's society. The first policy, like I have mentioned before, should be allowed due to many different reasons. I sincerely hope you can see my reasoning and make the right decision for this policy.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

I have heard of the two policies you have been considering, regarding cell phones in school. I just wanted to share with you my perspective about this situation. I believe that you should select policy number one. You want the children to look forward to coming to school, instead of feeling like they are forced to go someplace they dislike. Giving the students the right to use cell phones during lunch periods and other free times will give them the personality that you long to see. Also, if the students want to come to school more often that will have a huge affect on Count Day. If cell phones are used during these free times, i don't really think there will be a disturbance to other students/staff members.

Another, If students from other schools discover the new policy at our school district, they will want to transfer to the district to have these rights. Cell phones have been banned from schools for as long as i can remember; they should experiment with something new, since many generations are passing up the opportunity to still be in school, and just say, ""I never wanted to go to school, but I finished.""

The only thing is that I don't know what the parents of the children would say. Some might agree with the idea and won't mind their kids using cell phones in school, but some might disagree and want their kids to not be distracted during school, and to just learn the curriculum that the school has to offer. Many people are going to have different opinions, so the best thing to do is to take a poll for this matter. A poll where students and parents vote for what they believe should happen with this whole cell phone policy.

Therefore, my opinion is to choose policy one, where kids can use cell phones during free time. Let the students have some fun. But, it's your decision, you're the principal of this school, not me. Thank you for your time. Have a nice day!

"Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. These projects help to prepare students for the next year as well as help the retain the information from past years. Who is the best person to design these projects? The teacher, of course. Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers know how to prepare the students for the next year, they can adjust the difficulty level, and it's an opportunity to get the students used to the specific teaching style of the teacher they're going to have.

First, teachers know what's going to be on the curriculum, so the know how to best prepare students for the coming year. For example, if a student were to design their own project, they wouldn't know what to study, because they have yet to learn the material. Teachers, however, know exactly what to put in the project to help them prepare, and they can also incorporate material from the students' previous years so they won't forget it as easily. The teachers are also trained to teach, so they would be the best at designing these projects.

Some may say that students should design their own summer projects because they can adjust the difficulty level to suit themselves. The optimal level of difficulty varies among everyone, so they shouldn't all get the same project because it might be too easy for some, and too difficult for others. To negate the first statement, students are too likely to not do a project at all over the summer with an excuse such as, ""not needing to do a project because they're sure they can remember everything from the last year,"" or because ""they're a fast learner and can learn the new material quickly."" Some may even decide that their fun summer takes priority above all learning. If the teacher designs the project, then the teacher can make sure that everyone does a project so everyone will be able to excel in the coming years. To address the varying level of optimal difficulty level issue, There are AP, honors, and regular classes for this reason, and if, for any reason, the project is too hard or too easy, the student can talk to the teacher about that issue. All in all, it is best if the teacher designs the projects.

Lastly, it's an opportunity to get the students used to the specific teaching style of the teacher they're going to have. This greatly benefits the student, because studies show that people learn more and retain information longer when they're in a comfortable environment. Summer projects are a great way to make that first step into the school year and get the students familiar with a certain teaching style.

To sum it all up, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know the curriculum and can best prepare students for the next school year, they can adjust the difficulty of the project to challenge students, and it gives their new students an opportunity to become familiar with their teaching style. Summer projects are popularly viewed in a negative fashion, but these projects serve a very important use. They help students prepare for what's to come. Think about how many students are struggling to keep up with their classes, because they didn't do a summer project",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Homework over the summer break? No way! Many students believe we shouldn't have work over the break, however it is important to continue learning. Projects over the break should be student-based because, it allows them to chose a topic they will enjoy, they will continue to learn about new things and excel their knowledge, and lastly it will keep them occupied so they aren't constantly on their phones.

Projects over the summer may not be fun, however allowing the students to chose what they want to do will be more enjoying then a teacher-based project. Student-based projects don't always have to be that typical 8 page essay that students always dread. Students have the opportunity to go on an adventure and have fun with the project. Exploring something new is always the best way to learn. I have always believed that the journey is much better then the destination or final product. What matters most is that you are having fun while learning. This situation came up for me a while back. Over the summer I was given a science project. I was allowed to pick anything! I was so excited. I decided to learn about fish and how the enviornement affects them. Given the option of doing something I chose allowed me to venture out and explore. I decided to go to the aquarium. Being able to be let free with this project allowed me to learn something new that I may have never learned so much information about.

Student-based projects over the summer will allow the student to take the matter into their own hands. If it is something they are chosing, they will be more interested in that topic which will lead to the deeper exploration. I'm not a huge reader, so when I am given a book project on a book that doesn't intrigue me, I typically won't enjoy the reading which will cause me to put minimal effort into my project. It is not that I don't want to get a good grade, its that I didn't understand or relate to the book as if I was given the opportunity to chose my own book. It is a whole different story when it comes to the student being able to chose the book. If I was allowed to chose any book to read and complete a project on, it would allow me to research books that relate to me and my life. After reading the book, I will then want to show that I loved the book, causing me to show specfics that may have not been talked about in the book. I may have liked the book so much that I did research on the author and his personal life which would give me an enormous amount of examples I could write about/ talk about in my project.

Oh those phones! How many times over the summer have your parents asked you to put your phone down and do something? Trust me, it has happened to us all. Having these student-based projects will set deadlines for the students to finish the project, however they can have fun with it. Going along with the previous reasons, student-based projects will keep those dang phones out of the kids hands. We all know the parents will love this! Students who are given the opportunity to learn about something they like will keep them up off the couch, moving, and learning about something new. Allowing them to chose their own topic for the project will allow for an idea to spark in their mind, causing them to go seek out that information. Over the summer, I typically want to relax and hang out. There have been many times where I have gotten carried away with the time and caught myself on the couch all day. Giving the student-based project will divert them from becoming lazy and allowing them to go out and find something fun to learn about.

Summer is a time for a break, don't get me wrong. However we can't go that long break with out refreshing our mind of common knowledge. Giving these student-based projects will allow for students to continue to have fun over the summer as well as learning. Going a long time without learning often causes people to forget common sense and knowledge. This is why it's important to still learn over the summer. Lastly, allowing these students to have the leeway will let them go out and explore the world and not be so tunnel vissioned into the TV and their phones. You are always learning something new, however it always makes you happier when you learn about something you enjoy.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Should Schools Allow Student-Assigned or Teacher-Assigned Summer Projects?

How many times have teachers assigned summer projects, yet you only get half of the students' projects? Aren't you tired of getting only half your students' projects and having to chase students down to complete their projects. When will you learn students aren't interested in teacher-assigned projects. Why not give something else a try, like student-assigned projects. Instead of teacher-assigned summer projects, why not try student-assigned summer projects. It allows to student to be creative, work independently on projects like they will in future, and get students interested in their projects. For schools to assure students continue learning effectively over the summer they should allow summer projects to be student-assigned.

Schools allowing student-assigned summer projects allows students to design and customize their own projects to their own interest. Being able to allow students to pick a topic you're passionate about gets students interested in their summer projects. Since students are allowed to pick their own topics, the project is on something that they're interested in. Students have a chance to choose a topic they have an interest for or are passionate about. Therefore, this sets students up to become immersed in their summer projects. Student-assigned summer projects allows students to explore new topics that can spike interest for students to pursue a possible, future career path.

Having projects be student assigned allows students to work independently on projects as practice and preparation for independent study projects for college. In college student-assigned projects or independent study projects are assigned often, especially in STEM fields. To help students prepare for college, student -assigned summer projects will give them a preview as to what it is like to do an independent project. Students all ready feel high schools don't prepare them for college, but student-assigned projects can get students that needed preparation for college. Schools allowing student-assigned projects are helping their students to receive necessary preparation for college.

Some educators and students believe that teacher-assigned projects are the better choice over student-assigned projects. They think it will give more structure to the project, projects will explicitly follow the curriculum, and students will know exactly what they have to complete for the project. However, all teacher-assigned projects do is stifle creativity, lose student interest, and cause students to become more dependent on teachers for ideas. For example, whenever I have teacher-assigned projects I get excited about the project, but I forget about the rubric. Once I remember there is a rubric to be followed, all of my creative ideas for the project dissipate because they don't follow the rubric guidelines. Student-assigned projects allow for more creativity, students aren't bound by a rubric.

Schools should allow student-assigned summer projects, since it allows students to open up their minds and become creative thinkers. Teacher-assigned projects stifle the creative young minds of students. Assigning independent student projects allows students to independently explore their interest, prepare them for college, and lets students use their creative brains to learn. Student-assigned summer projects help students learn effectively over the summer break.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear principal,

""STUDENT_NAME, you should really come to the soup kitchen with me some time. It's really fun and the people are really happy that you're there."" This is something my friend suggested to me. I decided to go with her since I adore putting helping and putting a smile on people's faces. Therefore, i think it would be a great idea for students to be required to perform community service. For starters, there a lot of kids from our school that don't do anything out of school and the country is in need of extra help. Additionally, a friend of mine that goes to a different is required to do community service and he's happy and the princi

To begin, there are many kids that go home from school and watch television and eat for the rest of the day. As a result, they become lazy and end up, in some cases, gaining weight from doing nothing. If more students are required to do community service, it would actually give them an opportunity to go outside or to be with someone and have company. For example, i know for a fact, that STUDENT_NAME would rather be building a house for the homeless than watch another episode of Grey's Anatomy. I think that the principal's decision will definitely affect everyone in a situation like this.

Eventually, everywhere i look, there is a homeless person begging for money. Poverty is one of the greatest problems in the United States. I once gave a homeless person a single dollar and they were grateful to finally go and buy a hamburger at Burger King. Requiring students to be active in helping their communities is a good thought since some people, and students also, need some assistance. The students could help construct homes, feed the homeless, tutor the kids that can't go to school, etc.

Last but not least, community service isn't necessarily a bad thing to be involved in doing. Some other school require kids to do the community service and if they don't have the required amount, then they get punished. This would be an idea for the principal to ponder. He could easily punish the students for not doing what they're required to do and that would motivate the kids. On the other hand, the principal could also give the kids incentives for doing community service. For example, giving prizes to the students that perform the greatest amount of hours of community service. That way, the principal would be satisfied helping his community and the students would also be happy by getting something in return for their hard work.

In conclusion, i opinion that the great leader in the school should particularly make it mandatory for the pupils to do community service. It would give them something to do in their free time and it would benefit many people in the country that are in need of special services. The principal could also include incentives or punishments to motivate the students in doing the community service. Lastly, i feel, deep inside my heart, i feel that there are kids out there that desperately need to help kids instead of doing what they do. In other words, if the country needs helpers to assist in helping the environment and the citizens, then the principal should most likely make the students be active in their communities.",0,persuade_corpus,3

"To the principal

Do people prefer to do community service or play video games? In many ways a person can help other. Some other people prefer to do other things than help. In my opinion , the principal should require all students to do community service. At first it would be a good starting point to help shape teenager's life's. It would also be a good thing because you're helping other people. It can also be a good thing for the people that don't have as many opportunities. You may think that community service is boring and a waist of time, but you will see how helping others can change the world.

Some of the teenagers this days don't care about anyone else but themselves. That will not be good habit for when they grow up. As an adult you cant be sp gritty. A good opportunity to shape or help teenager's life can be real easy. If the principal requires all the students in the middle school then they will be forced t do something good for someone else. As they get use to doing it over and over it will become a habit to help other people.

Not everyone in this world has everything that is needed to have a normal life. By helping a group of elementary you don't only help them have a better education but you also are showing them that helping other people is good thing. There are many ways that you can help people even if it is by taking care of them or giving them food. This people will b thankful for the things you do. And some day in the future they can say that community service is not a waist of time.

Do you know how many people would give anything to have a day as you do? A lot of people in the united states don't have all the privileges as we do. Some of them don't even have a place to stay. If the principal of every middle school requires all the students have to be on community service, then that can be a start of a new world. We can all help by giving clothe, food, covers for beds, blankets etc. If there is one thousand students in every middle school then we can all help the less fortunate. And maybe even help everyone in this world have a normal life like we do.

As mentioned before people don't care enough to help other people. As a whole middle school helps atleast once or twice a week. Then they will get use to helping. This is just a simple why the principal should consider require all the students be on community service. It wont only help the less fortunate but it will also help teenagers with their future. And they can also learn that helping people is not always a waste of time. The principal should not only require students to perform community service but also show that community service is a thing that will always help someone in the world.      ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"There is a growing movement in lots of western countries to do less driving. In Bogota, the capital city of Colombia, a ""Day Without Cars"" has been established. It is an annual event where residents of the city are banned from using cars, and violators are fined. In Paris, residents were banned from using their vehicles for about week due to toxic emmisions, widely blamed on diesel fuel. In Germany, a development neighborhood called Vauban was created and has a strict policy on parking. Car-sized garages, and street parkin are banned, requiring residents to pay an extra 40000 dollars to purchase a parking space in the neighborhood. These ideals are even spreading to America.

Driving will emit toxins into the air, called greenhouse gases. These gases rise into the air, but are trapped by the ozone layer into our atmosphere and make the Earth warmer. This is a bad thing because the Arctic will start to melt and sea levels would rise. Now, vehicles are not the sole cause of this episdemic, but they are a large contributor. In Beijing, China it is said to be so polluted due to tailpipe emmisions that one would get sick if they were to go outside without a mask on to stop from breathing in the chemicals. In Paris, France the airborne toxins reached to a level just under the amount of chemicals in the air of Beijing. The city officials of Paris had to ban use of automobiles for about a week to rid the air of the poisons. If caught, vialotors were fined 22 euros (31 dollars American). This worked suprisingly well, and since the air cleared up, peoplpe are allowed to use their cars again. The Vauban in Germany is a neighborhood that has made it extremely difficult to own a vehicle. While vehicle ownership is permitted, car-sized garages are not included in the homes, and parking on the street is prohibited. If a resident wishes to park their vehicles, they must spend 40000 extra dollars along with the house for a space in a large garage at the edge of the development. This has all lead to cleaner air and happier, healthier people.

It is a well known fact the walking and cycling helps a person stay in shape. It keeps the heart flowing regularly, helps keep the lungs exercised, and keeps leg muscles strong ad healthy. If these ways of transportation are exhibited more often, and vehicles used less, we will not only have cleaner air, but a healthier human population. Walking can also help the brain work with the body to relieve stress, which puts people at less of a risk for heart disease. These factors are essential to producing a healthier population, which could let people live longer, and encourage them to do meaningful things that could benefit other parts of the world. The Internet has also been helpful in keeping people connected with friends and loved-ones without the need of driving to see them. It is possible to to center where you live around places to buy food and necessary supplies, as well as close to your workplace, all in walking distance. Even if that is not possible, finding a bus or public trnasportation route is always an option. It is less expensive than gasoline (tax included), car insurance, and any other expenses that might come with a privatly-owned vehicle. It is also less likely to get into an auto-accident when using public transportaion, and if it does happen it is not your responsibility to pay for the insurance deductible. All these factors and alternative transportaion methods can help to improve life for all people than it is with so many privately-owned vehicles.

The private owning of vehicles is convienient, but is still a hazard to the genearal health of our population. It poisons the air, and gives people an excuse to not walk or ride their bycyles as much, which can diminish their physical health. If we start to use privately owned vehicles less, however, it will promote the general welfare of our people. It is possible to cut the use of these vehicles short and preserve, even raise, our standards of living.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Attitude is an important factor in how successful a person is in life. It can influence relationships in both a positive and negative way, impacting overall well-being. Those with a positive attitude are more likely to attract positive life experiences and decisions, while those with a negative attitude can easily find themselves in a downward spiral. The implications of attitude can be seen both personally and socially; it can shape behavior and reactions in our everyday lives.

Having good attitude can be seen as an asset—it can minimize stress, help build strong relationships, and increase productivity. It can also boost confidence, open doors, and invite opportunity into our lives. A positive attitude can shape the way we think and act, and can help us to stay optimistic when faced with difficult situations.

On the other hand, a negative attitude can bring obstacles into our lives. It can affect relationships by creating tension and misunderstanding and can even lead to isolation. A negative attitude can also be a barrier for success and can cause us to overlook potential opportunities.

Ultimately, attitude plays an essential role in how we experience life. By taking a conscious approach to how we think, changing our perceptions and developing a positive attitude, we can experience positive outcomes and greater well-being. But it is up to us to take control of our attitude and make each day count.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Driverless cars would not be a great idea. There are many issues and concerns against the development of these cars. There are reasons why people have a driver's license. It makes having one pretty obsolete. All the work people have done for them and the practicing of driving will no longer be needed. The driverless car seems to be a lazy way of transportation and can cause problems on the road. The driverless car can cause and have problems such as navigating through roadwork or accidents and laws about faults.

The driverless car can have problems fucntioning and navigating through roadwork or accidents. So far they are not yet perfected in going completely driverless. Someone still has to be behind the wheel in case of something the car cannot do. The closest thing they have to driverless is not as one would expect. The cars can only do so much. As stated in the article, they still have to alert the driver to takeover whenever the car cannot do it itself. This is not very efficient considering its called a driverless car. The cars would need to be completely self aware in order to surpass these obstacles like road construction or accidents that have occured on the road.

The way laws would work are not yet established and if someone were to be in an accident, who would be at fault? This is another issue concerning these cars. Laws pertaining to this subject would need to be made. If someone were to crash the blame would be on the driver, of a normal car. When you birng a driverless car to the conversation the question then becomes, was it the driver or manufacturer of the car. As stated in the article traffic laws would change and new ones would be added. This branches off to more problems with the manufacturer and driver. The driver could make the argument that the manufacturer's vehicle is defective, and that is why they crashed. The manufacturer could say that the driver let his guard down and was too careless. Either way laws would be of concern.

The driverless car can be seen as a good thing, but the problems and defects it still has are a big concern. The car can have problems navigating through roadwork. It can also struggle driving around an accident that may have occurred nearby. There would need to be new laws and changes to the already made laws. The driverless car would be a pretty unefficient thing and could be dangerous.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Asking more than one person for advice can help you because each person you talk to won't give you the exact same advice. Every person has a different opinion and a different way of doing things. Each person will give you advice based on things that has happened to them. That's why asking different people for advice is always great help for making the right choice. You might not always agree with what advice is given to you but you need to understand that your not always going to agree with everything everyone says. Sometimes people say things that are not true. You should always ask for advice from people you trust like your parents, teachers, school counselors, aunts, uncles, grandmas, grandpas, siblings, cousins, or friends. Anyone that makes you feel good while talking. It's better to get advice from older people because they have had way more experience in life then you.

"Dear State Senator,

We have a big conflict containing the electoral college, Im debating on what we should do. Im all in favor for keeping the electoral college, Instead of going by the most popular vote. The most popular vote can be very difficult because the citizens that are voting are just choosing mostly perhaps they dont even know whats going on. They choose based on favoritism and that shouldnt be the case, when you're choosing something so important like this, you have to know the facts about that person and what they're willing to do for us as a whole. Theres a million reasons why the most popular vote shouldn't be even recommended for this, its unnecissariy It should never be based on favoritism its about what they bring to the table.

The electoral college is widely known as an anachronism. I have my opinion they have theres, their gonna give you opinions  about how unfair the electoral college is when in reality its not anything thats gonna harm you. Perhaps i think its safer then choosing someone that you have no idea about the decisions they wanna make. Yes people may no be that much interested in politics because their not involved that much. They have to do whatever it takes so our nation can be a great one. Leaving our nation in someone hands that doesnt really know what their doing is completely absurd. Do you know how bad that will make our nation look if we had one? I would be ashamed to claim this as my ""Home"".                                ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Do you knw what would be absolutly great? Well youÃÂ´re probably thinking of hundreds of things, but I know what didnÃÂ´t cross your mind and that is participating in extracurricular activities. Participating in at least one of these can change your life and should be mandatory.

Extracurricular activities should be mandatory because of two words ÃÂ¨The FutureÃÂ¨. Going to school is all about bettering your future. So what is a better way then having a extracurricular activity that you participate in? Besides being rich there is nothing and IÃÂ´m going to tell you why. One way itÃÂ´s better is it just gives you more things to put on a job application. The extracurricular also make colleges notice you more and can lead to many colleges wanting you to be at their school so everything will be paid for.

The Last reason I think a extracurricular activity should be mandatory is to work on students management skills.

Being in a extracurricular you would need to know how to find time for homework, studying, spending time with your family,and etc. Budgeting time is a skill you would need as you grow up no matter what you grow up to be or do. Considering that, learning how to at a young age makes it easier when you need to buget time the most.

"Advice can be invaluable for helping individuals make informed decisions. In school, having a trusted mentor or peer to turn to can make it easier to identify the best path forward in the face of any given situation. Research has found that advice can increase an individual's overall ability to make smart decisions by providing external perspective on their situation and identifying potential pitfalls or problematic behavior. In addition, having a reliable opinion can also build self-confidence within decision-making scenarios, as it provides reassurance that the chosen path is a considered one. 

That being said, it is important to be mindful of the limits of advice-taking. Advice-givers don’t necessarily understand the intricacies of an individual’s situation, and, in some cases, may put their own feelings or judgments ahead of others’ feelings or best interests. Therefore, it's vital to use advice as a tool to inform the decision-making process, rather than relying on it completely. It’s also important to have a source of advice that is engaging and supportive, to ensure that it is a helpful aid when making decisions. Ultimately, by being thoughtful and discerning with the advice-taking process, individuals can make better decisions and be rewarded for it.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student on the topic of schools controlling extracurricular activities:

Pros and Cons of Schools Controlling Extracurricular Activities

Schools play a significant role in shaping our lives, and one of the ways they do this is by controlling the involvement of extracurricular activities. While some people argue that schools should have complete control over these activities, others believe that it's important for students to have some freedom to choose their own interests. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of schools controlling extracurricular activities.

One of the pros of schools controlling extracurricular activities is that it helps students stay focused on their academic goals. By limiting the number of extracurricular activities available, schools can ensure that students are not overwhelmed with too many commitments. This can help students prioritize their studies and avoid falling behind in their schoolwork. Additionally, schools can ensure that the extracurricular activities they offer are relevant to the students' academic goals, such as sports teams that help improve physical fitness or music clubs that enhance musical skills.

Another pro of schools controlling extracurricular activities is that it can help promote school spirit and unity. By offering a limited number of activities, schools can encourage students to participate in the ones that interest them the most. This can create a sense of community and school pride, as students are more likely to be engaged in activities that they enjoy. Moreover, schools can use these activities as a way to bring students together and promote school events, such as sports games or concerts.

However, there are also some cons of schools controlling extracurricular activities. One of the main cons is that it can limit students' freedom to choose their own interests. By offering only a few activities, schools may not be able to cater to the diverse interests of their students. This can lead to students feeling uninspired and disengaged from their schoolwork. Moreover, schools may not be able to accommodate students who have unique interests that don't fit into the limited number of activities offered.

Another con of schools controlling extracurricular activities is that it can create a competitive atmosphere. By limiting the number of activities available",1,llama2_chat,4
"Would you want to live on Venus? If you had a choice would you stay on earth or leave and go live on Venus? Well if you were to even want to live on venus you will come up with many challenges. Exploring Venus is challenging enough there are some dangers that you have to look out for. Venus has the hottest suface tempature of any planet in our solor system,high pressure and heat,erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. The author of this artice makes very detailed explanations on to why this is very challlenging to explore let alone live.

Venus is referred as the ""twin"" planet to our Earth, but if venus is so inhospitable why are scientists to making plans for more people to visit. Yes many astronomers are very amussed and fascinated by Venus but does that make up for the fact that venus is very dangerous? ""...it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar sytem.""If this is true then why is it so dangerous now? Why can people live in Venus and Earth? Venus stil has features that are just like Earth. For example,""...surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys,moutains,and craters....recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit..""

""...researchers cannot take samples of rock,gas,or anything else from a distance....would need yo get up close and personal despite the risks. or maybe we should think of them as challenges.""If the reacherers can't take some samples of the real life object how can we reallt test them the right way and ger correct information about them. If they can get information then we wonr ever know if som say we would be able to have life on another planet.

Could you imagine being on another taking picture to remember exactaly how things were? Well keep using you imagination just like the scientists.""Modern computures are enormously powerful,flexible,and quick,but tend to be more delicate when is comems to extreme physical conditons. Just imagine exposing a cel phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin.""Would your pictures even ,make it back to earth?

Due to th high pressure and heat,erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface, most things wouldnt survie on Venus. You could bake to death over there. Everything would melt. It is to dangeous to explore on Venus but we can all hope one day that it would be safe enough for good research on that planet ""Earth's twin"".",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The Electoral College has been around for many years. It is not an actual college, or location. It is a process where American citizens select their electors, however proceeding that the electors make their votes for President and Vice President; Congress counts for electoral votes. But, the Electoral College is a very controversial process, many people are for it, but many are also against it. Some even wanting to get 'rid of the Electoral College overall. We should ban the Electoral College for it does not satisfy American people.

Electors in the Electoral College can vote for whomever they want, giving American people the wrong idea and vote for the wrong presidential candidate. In the article (source 2) ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This quote from the article shows that not always can the American people be guaranteed who their electors vote for, and electors can give voters the wrong information and vote for the opposing candidate. This would be going against American people, dissatisfying them. In the article (source 3) by Richard A. Posner it states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" American people can be confused, infused with the wrong information by Electors, and vote for a candidate that has no interest in carrying their state.

Larger states get more attention than the smaller states due to their high number of electoral votes. In the article (source 3) by Richard A. Posner it says, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" Obama had won 29 electoral votes in Florida (high number) due to him making speeches and campaigns throughout the state. Paying his upmost attention to that state due to the high number of electoral votes he was trying to gain. Whereas in a smaller state such as Wyoming, he would not want to waste time paying much attention there where he can only gain 3 electoral votes! This is simply unfair and at most dissatisfying for the citizens who live in the smaller states with low electoral votes such as Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island, etc.

The Electoral College has been around for a long time, and in the end we DO receive a president in the end. But, imagine if this unfairness keeps going every four years an election happens. American people not being guaranteed their candidate, smaller states not getting as much campaign as the larger ones, etc. We do though, receive a president in the end. But what if it's a president that we do not want? That we were not fairly given? Just look at what happened with George Bush! There are many simple advantages to the Electoral College, but there are also many concerns that can outnumber.

The Electoral College should be gotten rid of because of how unfair it is to American citizens. If the issues with the Electoral College are not taken care of in the present, just imagine what our future elections will be like. Us American people need to take a stand against the Electoral College, and the process involved. Once a new popular process is created and introduced, it can provide us more justice and fairness than the Electoral College.             ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Hey there!  So, I reckon working in a group and working alone are like two different worlds, ya know? Both have their own benefits and challenges, and it's pretty cool to think about how they can complement each other.

Working in a group is like, super helpful when you're trying to get something done. You can all share ideas and brainstorm together, and before you know it, you've got a pretty sweet project or presentation. Plus, it's way easier to divide tasks and work on 'em when you're part of a team. For instance, if you're working on a group project for school, you can assign tasks to different people based on their strengths and weaknesses. It's like, a win-win situation!

But, working alone can also be pretty cool. Like, when you're working on a creative project, it's way easier to get into that zone when you're by yourself. You can just focus on your ideas and bring 'em to life without worrying about what anyone else thinks. Plus, you can work at your own pace, which can be super helpful if you're someone who likes to take their time and make sure things are just right. For example, if you're writing a story or drawing a comic, it's way easier to get into the zone when you're alone.

One example of how working in a group adds value is when we did that science fair project last year. We were supposed to research a topic and create a display board, and we decided to do it as a group. It was way easier to brainstorm ideas and come up with a plan when we were all together, and we could bounce ideas off each other. Plus, we could divide the workload and make sure everything got done on time. If we had tried to do it alone, it would've taken way longer and we probably wouldn't have done as good of a job.

But, working alone can also cause challenges. Like, if you're working on a project and you don't have anyone to bounce ideas off of, it can be hard to come up with new ideas. You might get stuck in a rut and not know how to move forward. And, if you're working",1,llama2_chat,1
"Why only seek one opinion when you can get multiple? People often go to more than one person for advice when they need an opinion. If you only seek advice from one person you might not be very confident in your choice. The more people you get advice from, the better choice you can make.

Although one persons opinion might feel like enough, its better to get many. One person might have a slightly bias opinion on a situation. They also might give advice they ends up helping themselves more than you. When you get more opinions it is a less likely chance that all the opinions will be bias.

Getting more than one piece of advice could also help you feel more confident when making a decision.

If you only get one persons advice then you likely will not feel very confident while making the decision and might not be happy with your decision later. If you get multiple opinions you can feel confident in your decision and not dread about how it might be a bad decision. Being confident in your decision will make you feel like you made the right choice.

Even if you get one bad opinion you do not agree with or think is a bad idea, it can help you see what choice you actually want and should make. When getting opinions you might be able to realize what you actually want and what would be the best decision. If you receive certain advice but do not like it, the opinion was still helpful to you because you can be more sure that you dont like that opinion and you like other opinions better. All together bad opinions also help with making good choices.

The more advice you receive the better choice you will end up making. More opinions will always help you feel more confident in your decision. Always seek more than one person for advice even if its not a major decision. Remember than all advice, whether good or bad, help you make the right decision.",0,persuade_corpus,4

"As seen in paragraph 2 it says how venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size,but it also says that there were attempts to launch unmanned aircraft onto the planet and non of them lasted a few hours which is why there hasn't been an aircraft actually to land on venus. Paragraph 2 shows a little taste of how dangerous venus is but it is enticing to learn more about the planet itself. In paragraph 3 it explains how venus's atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and the clouds are highly corrosive with temperatures reaching more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These are even more reasons on why it is dangerous but yet you would wanna know more about it.

The reason why scientists wanna know more about the planet even though it is dangerous is because in paragraph 4 it says That ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Which is another reason why scientists wanna know more about venus and what it has in store. The planet seems to be a very cool place to live without all the set backs with the atmosphere and the corrosive clouds. The scientists of NASA have an idea on how to send a manned vehicle to venus without getting into all the dangerous areas by putting a blimp like air vehicle hovering 30 miles above all of the bad and dangerous chemicals and heat.

The reason it would be a very good thing to study on is because of it being similar to earth in many ways. One reason why is said in paragraph 8 in which it states "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Which i do agree on this being a good cause because not only do we get knowledge but we get more into it which is a dangerous route but it is for the good of man and how not only will we be able to put man on Venus one day but to be able to further our own civilitation. Another dangerous part about the exploration is that we go back to the part where it says no aircraft has ever been able to withstand only a few hours of the planets atmosphere,but as it says in paragraph 7 they are making a vehicle that can survey and gain knowledge on the planet instead of sending a vehicle on the planet. Scientists will be able to gain the knowledge on how to produce a product for NASA that can both withstand the harsh heat and atmosphere but move on the planet like a rover.",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Positive Attitudes

As an eighth-grade student, I have learned that having a positive attitude can have a significant impact on a person's success, happiness, and acceptance within a community. In my research, I have discovered that personal experiences and life lessons can contribute to one's attitude, and people with positive attitudes can serve as role models in a community. Furthermore, positivity can help one realize their potential and achieve success.

Firstly, having a positive attitude can lead to greater success in various aspects of life. Studies have shown that people with positive attitudes tend to be more motivated, focused, and productive than those with negative attitudes. This can translate into better academic performance, increased job satisfaction, and improved relationships with others. For example, when faced with challenges, people with positive attitudes are more likely to view them as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than obstacles to be overcome. This mindset can lead to greater creativity, innovation, and problem-solving skills.

Secondly, personal experiences and life lessons can shape a person's attitude. Positive experiences, such as achieving a goal or receiving recognition for a job well done, can reinforce a positive attitude and increase self-esteem. Conversely, negative experiences, such as failure or rejection, can lead to a more negative attitude and decrease self-confidence. Additionally, life lessons, such as learning from mistakes and learning to persevere through adversity, can help individuals develop a more positive attitude and resilience.

Thirdly, people with positive attitudes can serve as role models in a community. They can inspire others to adopt a more positive attitude and encourage them to pursue their goals and dreams. Role models can also provide guidance and support to those who may be struggling with negative emotions or experiences. By modeling positive behaviors and attitudes, role models can help to create a more positive and supportive community.

Fourthly, positivity can help individuals realize their potential and achieve success. When people have a positive attitude, they are more likely to believe in themselves and their abilities. This can lead to greater self-confidence, which can in turn lead to greater motivation and effort towards achieving their goals. Additionally, positivity can help individuals overcome self-doubt and fear, which can hold them back from pursuing their full potential.

Finally, it is important to encourage and acknowledge people with positive attitudes. This",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"In many ways, driving is a great resource.  But with this great resouce, comes flaws.  When cars burn gas made of fossil fuels, it causes many environmental disadvantages.  Limiting the usage of cars could be good for the people who live on this planet (everyone) in many ways.

To start, one reason why limiting the usage of cars would be an advantage for our society is the reduction of smog.  Smog is caused by the smoke and fog of car exaust and it is very harming to the environment as well as to humans.  In Paris, in 2014, driving was banned because of smog.  ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.  On Monday motorist with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home  or suffer a 22-euro (31 dollar) fine.  The same would apply to odd-numbered plated the following day.""  (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog) This quote from the souce shows that because Paris is such a huge and global city, the amount of cars needed to have the city function in the way society has been making it function for the past years has created serious pollution.  This crazy amount of pollution created smog in Paris.  In fact, according to the article, ""[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""  (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog)  This type of pollution is know for causing certain kinds of cancer in people, and is what is thought to be the reason for the O-zone hole above Antartica.  Not to mention it makes the day gloomy and not as bright because of the trapped smoke and pollution.  In Vauban, Germany, the ""streets are completely 'car-free'"" (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars)

A resident from this suburb said ""'When I had a car I was Always tense.  I'm much happier this way.'""  Heidrun Walter says this as an example of how it is less stressful to walk places and hear the sounds of nature rather than feel the responability and worry that comes with driving her children place to place.

Another reason why it is more advantageous to limit the usage of cars is that it makes people be forced to start working on healthy habits (walking, riding bikes) as well as keeps pollution levels down with car pooling and other different means of travel.  ""Bogota, Colombia- In a program that's set to spears to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota) This car- free day program in Bogota is a good example of how people choose healthier ways to get around the city.  Skating hiking and biking are all great ways to get around the city to work because they cause the person commuting by these methods to exersise.  Also, if some peopkle so choose to take the bus, they are still helping to make the city, and world, more healthy by reducing the amount of pollution.  There are also trends within the youth of the United States that shows a decrease in wanting to drive.  ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate.  There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16-39-year-olds getting a license..."" (Source 4: The End of Car Culture)  This shows a distinct drop in the number of new aged drivers getting their license.  Most teenagers these days don'r see the big deal in driving as was seen when it was a new phenominon.  ""He (Mr. Sivak) and I have similar observations about our children.  Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy.""  This was stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal (Source 4: The End of Car Culture)  Rosenthal isn't the only parent to see a decline in the interest to drive from their kids.  Many people have arguments with their children everyday trying to get them to drive, but there is far less of an interest from teenagers anymore.  Most young people see a car as ""just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesnt work."" (Source 4: The End of Car Culture) With this disinterest, there could be a large decrease in the pollution given off by cars, and cause a much healthier future for Earth and the people who inhabit it.

In conclusion, by limiting the usage of cars we would be given several advantages.  Of these advantages are a healthier life style, and the reduction of pollution and smog.  Both of these would lead to a happier and healthier Earth for humans, and the future of human kind to exist and live on.

"I think theat limiting car usage in some cities and towns can be a good thing. It can be helpful because with less cars on the road that means less trafic on the roads. It is also helpul because if your need to get somewhere, now you can walk, run, or bike ride there.

Limiting cars on the road can help public transportation get to their destination faster because there is less trafic. With less cars on the road in helps the Planet by comsuming fuel. By driving your car around the citie, it causes pollution to be in the air, the same air we breathe. According to the article, in some cities like Paris and Bejing, they baned driving your own car due to the pollution it releases in the the atmosphere. If you are caught driving your own car out in pulic you can get finned and even towed away.

In addition to limiting car usage, it can benefit you getting some exercise. To get to places, you would either have to ride a bike or walk there. It can help you loose weight or to get your cardio vascular system going and ready for the day. Even if your destination is far away, you would have to walk to the bus stop, even just a short little walk everyday for many days can help your fitness, and can keep you healthy.

In conclusion, Limiting usage of cars is helpful to the environment and also to your fitness, keeping cars off the road for public transportation the get to destionations quicker.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Hey, I'm like, totally stoked to be writing this essay! 😃 So, you know how some students can graduate early? Like, a year or two early? I think it's like, totally cool! 🤯 But, there are also some drawbacks, you know? Like, what if they're not ready for college or the workforce? 🤔

So, let's talk about the benefits first! If students can graduate early, they can like, get a head start on their college career or job prospects! 🎉 They can take college classes during high school, which means they can save time and money in the long run. Plus, they can like, get a taste of college life and figure out what they want to study before everyone else! 🤓 It's like, super beneficial! 💡

But, there are also some risks, you know? Like, what if they're not ready for college? 😕 They might struggle in their classes, or they might not be able to handle the workload. And what if they're not ready for the workforce? 🤔 They might not have the skills or experience they need to land a job. It's like, important to make sure they're really ready before they graduate early! 💯

So, like, in conclusion, graduating early can be totally awesome, but we gotta make sure students are ready for the next step! 😃 It's like, totally important to consider the benefits and drawbacks before making a decision. But, if they're ready and they're gonna take advantage of the opportunities, it can be like, super beneficial! 💯🎉",1,llama2_chat,2
"I support driverless cars to an extent. Driverless cars seem like they could help out a lot, but as paragraph nine states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault---the driver or the manufacturer?""

That's a good question too because the driver wasn't expecting for the technology to fail, but the driver should have been ready anyways.

I enjoy the things that current smart cars do like stopping for you because it can sense the environment, but if we rely on smart cars too much it can be a problem. For example if we would rely on smart cars too often there are chances where we expect a certain thing that the car can do for our safety, but it ends up malfunctioning and causing an accident that could be deadly. I think we should stick with driverless features, but not rely on them because you always need to be ready just in case they do malfunction. It can be very deadly if you completely rely on your driverless car.

I agree with parargraph eight in it's explanation of texting and driving because many people text and there are many accidents every year due to texting and driving. In the paragraph the text states that, ""Such displays can be turned off intantly when the driver needs to take over---something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.""

I find this to be very helpful for someone who texts and drives, it could possibly lower accidents caused by texting and driving. It could be very helpful to people with emergencies too where they have to respond immediately to a message, but they're driving, if they have a smart car they can let it take over for a small moment to answer the text message.

I'm going to refer back to paragraph nine again about laws being affected by driverless cars. In paragraph nine it states, ""Presently, traffic laws are written wih the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars.""

New laws will have to be made in order to make driverless cars legal and tht could be a problem because of all the work that is put into creating laws anyways. It could cause a confusing mess with the law system and driver's license tests would have to be remade to fit the requirement of driverless cars. Safety laws would also be affected because of the malfunctions that could happen with driverless cars as I talked about above.

As I said before, I agree with driverless cars to an extent. There can be positive effects of driverless cars, but there can also be negative effects too. I feel that we need the option to have a driverless car, but still rely on yourself to drive it and only use the driverlees option when necessary.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The author supports his or her evidence by giving us what Venus is like before astronauts try to explore Venus. They give a brief paragraphs of what Venus is like and the last time NASA to explore Venus. Venus is a hard planet to go even though it right behind the sun.

Venus can be a good planet to discver in the article it mentions that we us has human beings, havent touch the surface of Venus.

"The electoral college is the current method for choosing a president of the United States.  In this method, voters from each state do not vote for the president directly, they vote for people to elect the president.  Even though this system has existed for decades and decades, some people protest is and claim that it is not ""democratic"" enough.  I will give my personal opinions on why the Electoral College should be kept.

The main reason for keeping the Electoral College is that it works, and has been working for over 200 years.  When a way of living has been around as long as this has, it is extremely difficult to change and convince people to support the change.  Again, it works and as the saying goes, ""if it is not broke, do not fix it.""  Though, ""is not"" and ""do not"" are contractions in the actual expression.

I can see why the people who protest the Electoral College dre against it, and that a president should be decided by the people, not electors chosen by people.  However I do not think it makes much of a difference who is being trusted to do what one likes about them.  It is either the elector is trusted to pick the right president, or the president is trusted do do the right thing.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Cell phones are glorious pieces of technology, they are sometimes seen as an attention hog to kids and teenagers, but at other times a life-saving device. I believe that you should let kids have phones at school and use them only during lunch and free times. You should do this because it can help kids grades go up, it can help in emergencies, and it can entertain the kids themselves more.

First off, kids are always forgetting things. The most forgotten thing for kids is their homework. Because of this habit of lack of remembering, kids grades usually go down just because they forgot their homework. Well with cell phones their grades could go back up. If a kid ever forgot his/her homework at home, they could just call their parents or their brother or sister to come bring it to them at school. Cell phones would have saves the day again!

Second, emergencies tend to happen sometimes. They can be big emergencies like a fire, lockdown, etc. Or they can be small emergencies like forgetting your lunch at home. With cell phones, emergencies could be solved better! If a kid forgot their lunch they could call home and have someone get it for them. If a fire started in the school someone with a cell phone could call 911 and have immediate response. Without cell phones kids would be hungry and we would have to wait for a teacher to call the fire department to get it put out. That would be disastrous. Just another reason kids should have their cell phones.

Last, Kids always need to be entertained. Entertainment is a part of childhood and sometimes its not exactly found at lunch. If kids could use their cell phones at lunch they could have fun texting their friend who lives in another state, or calling their friend to see why he/she isn't at school today. See, this also provides entertainment!

Cell phones are today's revolution, and they can be bad at sometimes, but very good at others. that is why this school should have cell phones available to them so they can stop forgetting homework, get emergencies handled, and have something fun to do at lunch",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Dear Senator,

After doing some background research on the theme of the electoral college, i have realized that this system is wrong and should be changed. Now you msy aks yourself why?. Here are my reasons on why to exterminate the electoral college. And my ideas on what is going to replace it.

What the electoral college does is basically a chain of votes. Meaning someone votes for someone and then that someone votes for another someone. This may seem confusing, and personally i think it is!. Why vote for a slate of electors when we could vote for the president. I mena is like skipping a step of the sequence(a very complex sequence)

dont you think its easier, faster, better and less confusing to just vote for the president. Every single citizen votes for who they want. thats why i propose an idea. this idea is easier, faster and better...

Mr/Ms Senator lets apply the election by popular vote system. its less confusing and less biased. For ex. if u want to vote for ""Tim Hart""for president, you just have to vote simple right; now using the other system you have to vote for the group of democtratic people that is voting for Tim Hart. And then hope that they didnt steal your vote, and they voted for another candidate. You see what im saying her. The system of popular election vote is way safer than the electoral college.

Also this system is more equal than the other, speaking of the problem of small states. Ex ""large states gets more attention form presidential candidates than a small state does""(4 big states, P 21 L 10). This shows that the electoral college system is unequal. Now in the other hand with our system , no matter small or large states, everyone will get the same attencion.

To conclude this essay the election by popular vote is clearly safer, faster, better and more equal than the electoral college, this is why i ask you if you could just think about the idea, and share the word with your collics and people you know

Thanks    ",0,persuade_corpus,4

In paragrah one he is talking about how Venus is closely similar to Earth in size shae an mass by saying ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of Density and size, and occasinally the closest in distance too.""

He also states in paragrah five that NASA is working on a methid to buuild on Venus by having large floting blimps that fly over the death and missery of the planets serfice.

exploring Benus could also bring about new methids of taraforming to make a planets serfice hospidible.

Exploring Venus could also bring about new ways to space travle and new technology.

In paragraph seven the auther mentions mechanical computers that dont relay on electricity and small and insitive chips but insted rely on gears and clock works.

"Seeking advice from multiple people can help you in many ways. If you seek advice from people, you can gain more knowledge and could learn new things! When you have trouble with something and you have no one to ask, then it would be hard for you to learn and understand. The more people you talk to,the more knowledge you gain and study. Seeking advice from multiple people can help you because you can learn, understand, and think of new ways to create.

If you talk to only one person, you won't get that much advice from them, however, when you talk to multiple people, you will most likely have more advice. Learning can help you a lot and you will need it in the future. Learning things like math, science, English, etc. could help you in getting jobs, and you might use it in your life. You can learn by going to school, or you could ask people around you. That is why I think taking peoples advice can help you learn a lot.

If you learn something new, you must always understand the topic so you can use that advice later on. Understanding makes you progress things in your mind, so you can understand more clearly. If you don't clearly understand what the topic is about, you could ask the teacher or your friends for help. Some people understand more than others, so you can always ask when you dont understand. There are a lot of ways you could understand, for example, listening to peoples advises, and write down notes so you can go back and read when you don't understand.

Taking advice from people can help you think of new ways. It could help by using their information and creating something new, like an invention. You can use math to find the longitude and latitude, or make treatments for the sick by using science. Everything that you learn can make new inventions in the future and could save a person's life. That is why learning new things and using it for ideas can be really helpful and good for people.

Taking advice from people can help people in many ways and could affect our future. Learning from multiple people can help you gain and understand more things that you might need help with. Every advice from a different person will not be the same because some people are smarter than others. If you have a question, or have trouble with something, learing more from people could help you in the present and in the future. And that is why taking advice from people can help you in many ways, and understand more clearly about the question you are having trouble on.                ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Emotional expressions

Did you know that emotional expression are easily to see. Using technology to see emotional expression, you can see it in video imagery. this can track some facial movements in a real face or in a painted face. or humans can perform some facial expressions.

Humans can probably see when a person is doing a facial expression by how they feel. Like for example if they are sad, happy, or worried, you can easily see it by their expressions. In computers if you take a picture and put on the computer and you are smiling the computer would see what kind of emotions you will have. Also in some computer can animate some faces expression like for example when a character from a movie is having a painful feeling you can animated and put the emotion that the character is feeling. Like for example the character's emotin is sadness, happy, worried, angry, etc. You can also show some facial expression by moving your muscles like for example, eyebrows, mouth, nose, etc. You can make expression by just moving some muscles in your face.

"If schools are giving students projects to do over the summer, then the projects should be student-designed. I would imagine giving students summer projects to be a pain for them, since many students are taking a long break away from school and have probably made plans to do things with their family and friends, but if they were to be given projects that can come up with on their own, students would continue to learn about the lessons that their teachers had given them, the project alone would increase their creativity, and school counties will be able to see how much information they have taken in over the entire school year.

Although students coming up with their own assignments to do for the summer project would increase their learning abilities, have trouble thinking of their own project and how they're going to make it. Not only that but teachers assigning the project to their students would be a bit easier than students having to look up a topic and figure out what to do on their own. I know that sometimes having to figure out what you are going to figure can be a bit challenging, especially if you dont know what the topic of the project is, but having a teacher assign the project to you would be less frustrating because they can tell you what you do and do not have to do or what you need before you leave for summer break.

Students being given assignments by teacher would also be a terrible option due to the fact that said student would not be able to be as creative as he/she wants to and they would not be able to do the topic that they wanted to do. For example, a teacher talks about the summer-project and he/she would assign them to do the project on something history related. It wouldnt exactly be fair to any of the other students in the classroom who dont want to do the topic in what their teacher gave them. Having to do the project alone during their break would already be a pain, but i think if the student had created something related to what they wanted to do, then it could make them more inspired, and motivated instead of giving them something that theyre not even interested in, which is exactly why i think student-designed summer projects would be the better option.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"A great many people belive that the Cydonia mesa is created by extra-terrestrial life forms or 'aliens'. While this is a very popular opnion that appears through out the media, such as books, magazines, and talk shows, it doesen't seem to have the scientific proof the back it up. The Cydonia mesa was created though natural means and there were cerntainly no aliens involved.

Some people might say that NASA would want to cover the mesa up if it was created by aliens, which make no economic sense. If extra-terrestrial life was found, NASA would get sizeable grants from the goverment to continue with the space exploration program. NASA decribed this as a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth"". There was no mention of aliens.

Many imaging devices were sent to find out wether the Cydonia mesa was in fact an alien artifact. Their names were the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Orbiter Camrea, each one better than the last. Better camreas, better crews, and everyone was trying to figure out this strange land mass. This was hard, because it takes a long time to line up a camera perfectly with an orbiting, spinning planet.

Finally on April 5th of 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the mesa and snapped a picture. No aliens to be seen anywhere. Still, people weren't satisfied. They protesteted that the picture was taken in cloudly weather and thats why there were no extra-terrestials.

On April 8th of 2001, a cloudless, summer day, they flew over again and snapped a picture. In this picture it was crystal clear it was just a mesa. There were no signs of alien life and nobody was able to dispute it.

There was not one thing on that planet that even remotly pointed to the idea of extra-terrestrials on Mars. Even if there was, NASA would report it as soon as possible for financial gain. The money they would get to keep looking would be sizeable. So they decided to look, and they sent up many camreas to get photos. All those photos proved one thing.

What Paris is doing is correct they want to get rid of the smog and the only way to do it is to get rid of the cars. Paris has more smog then other European capitals.

In the article ""In German Surburb,Life Goes On Without Cars"" Heidrun Walter states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Having a car is always stressful you always have to think if your car needs gas or your always stuck in traffic. Without a car we don't have to worry about things like that.

In these year there are not some many cars in the streets as there used to be. People perfer to take a bus or ride there bikes to work.

Using a car can also be a benift. How can people get to places that are far away, not by walking or not taking the bus. What happens if the theb route your taking dosen't go where you need to be. The perfect solution is getting a car. You can car-pool your friends. However the gas price keeps going up. All the money you spend on your car bill. Use it for taking you family to eat or the one year family trip. In the article"""" a mother says that her 19 and 21 year old are not interested in getting there driver license ""They are interested but it's not a priority.

"Dear Senator,

I feel the need to eliminate the Electoral College process of voting and just have a regular election where the President with the most votes wins, as simple as that. Each vote counts as one, and there will be more or less votes depending on the state and its size and population.

Just like Source 2, I feel ""The Electroal College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. "" ""Abolish the electroal college!"". When you vote, you vote for ""a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President"" (Source 2, Paragraph 2). Why can't it just be a regular election where you either bubble your democrat or republican representative instead of being so complicated and misleading. This can get people confused, and get them to vote for the wrong candidate without them even realizing! ""Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" (Source 2, Paragraph 2). In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't even get to see the candidates in a campaign ads; they focus on the ""bigger"" and more important swing-states to win. Each person should count as one, and each state should be as important as the other, just varying in the number of voters they had.

In Source 1, it says how ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" You're electing electors instead of just who you want for President. To top it off, you can't even control who your electors vote for! So people can vote for an elector thinking that he's going to vote for the Republican party but then he votes for the Democratic party. This process can be very misleading. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."". The disaster factor as mentioned in Source 2 could aways occur.

Some counter-arguments might include the certainty of outcome, and how the Electoral Vote might be greater than the Popular Vote. But at the end of the day, the people are nominating their president, they don't want others to do it for them. The Popular Vote representing our country as a whole with all individual votes added up should be the deciding factor. A tie is almost impossible in that circumstance also, because what are the chances out of millions of citizens the number would be perfectly split in half. If a president appeals for a region, then  let them vote for who they believe is the better candidate. At the end of the day, the majority wins. Swing states won't have to be a factor without the Electoral College, and big states are just counted them same, one point per vote. Run-off elections won't be necessary if the highest percentage president wins, even if its not majority.

So, hopefully you see my view on this issue and the Electoral College can be eliminated.

"In the modern world, technology plays an increasingly large role in our daily lives. While the limitation of physical contact between people may be considered a drawback of technology, it is not the only possible outcome. There are undeniable benefits to technological advancement, particularly in terms of reducing the amount of time needed to complete daily tasks and increasing our autonomy and convenience. 

One distinct advantage to technology is that it reduces the amount of time needed to complete mundane tasks. For example, the introduction of automated machines has drastically reduced the amount of time needed to manufacture products. Similarly, online banking services help people manage their finances faster through the convenience of automation. 

Not only does technology reduce the time spent on tasks, it also provides greater autonomy and convenience to people's lives. With the help of smartphones and other devices, people can access a plethora of information, meaning they have access to a host of tools and knowledge at the touch of a button. This makes tasks that would have otherwise been difficult or impossible not long ago significantly easier.

In conclusion, it is clear that technology can provide a substantial positive impact on people's lives. By reducing the amount of time required to do certain tasks and providing greater autonomy and convenience, technology has the potential to make life easier and simpler for everyone.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Good advice can be tricky to come by. Most people, when looking for an answer, tend to go to family or friends. Seeking out a trusted person in your life could be good, but only asking one person most likely won't help you to the extent you may be looking for. Not everyone is the same, and one person could give you advice that worked for them, but might not benefit you. Asking multiple people gives you different viewpoints and options to think over.

What makes up good advice? Well advice in general is a piece of information or and opinion on a situation. You could be asking for help ranging from a moral issue to a fight with friends. Advice can be found everywhere, in quotes, poems, books, from your friends, family, teachers, or even strangers. Good advice usually comes from a known source, or someone you can trust. Everybody looks for a different type of advice, even if it doesn't work for you, it could still work for someone else. Good advice is something that will help you fix a problem or help you see things differently than you have before.

When faced with a problem, many people ask for advice. Advice is one of those things that anyone can give, but not all are good at. If you have one friend who always gives good advice, you may gravitate towards them first, rather than someone who may not be as skilled. However, everybody has different experiences, and may be able to relate to your problem more than someone else. Asking people who have been in your situation is a great way to hear what they did and weigh the options.

If someone is given two options, they will likely take less time thinking over the options and choosing between the two than they would if given multiple. Having a variety of opinions and solutions may help you weigh out the good and bad. Only having one option could keep you from seeing the bad parts of the plan because you have nothing else to compare it to. Though it may take longer, deciding which works best for you may be worth it in the end.

There are multiple ways to compare advice. First, make a pros and cons list. These are very simple to make and are a good way to see exactly what each bit of advice entails. Another good way is to just simply think through each scenario. Say to yourself, if I follow this advice, then what would happen. If any piece of advice leads to a bad or undesirable outcome, you may want to eliminate it and choose a different one. The last way to compare could be to think of the source. Did this advice come from someone reputable, or trustworthy, do they have experience in my situation, and would they possibly lie to protect me or to keep my feelings from being hurt? If the source turns out to be bad, then move onto your next option.

Not all people like talking about their problems to many people. These people may decide on a solution, then simply to a sort of poll, to validate it. They may ask someone, should I do this, and weigh the amount of ""yes"" to the amount of ""no"" and decide whether or not it is good based off of that. Though this method works, you may be blind sided and not be able to see both parts of your solution. Rather than doing a yes or no poll, asking people for advice and instead, writing them down and grouping them together by what they mean is a better way to conduct a poll. If someone tells you yes or no, they aren't able to tell you exactly what they do or do not like about your idea.

Asking advice from multiple people could benefit you in many ways. You have more options, more sources, and more to think about. Even though not every bit of advice you get may work for you, it is important to hear different points of view. Just because you know someone and trust them, doesn't mean they always know what is best for you.

In the end, it is up to you to decide what you listen to. Choose the advice you take carefully, not all of it is there to help you.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I was very excited about my first trip to the West Coast (California) that I took last summer. It was a place Ive always fantazized over because of its variety of beauty from the surfing beaches to the skiing mountains to the north. When I first landed in LA, I expected some hustle and bustle of the city like Miami, but it was overwhelming to see the smog and traffic that polluted many peoples views of California, along with the air. Unfortunately, this is the case in many car intensive cities across the globe where limiting car usage would go a great deal farther than people actually know. The advantages of limiting car usage would allow for cleaner cities with less air pollution, and provide safety for pedestrians and even other car-users.

According to source 1 on car-free cities, Elizabeth Rosenthal states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas of the United States"" (Rosenthal, paragraph 5). This stat only presents part of the problem as the commercial and delivery industry add to that figure as well. Limiting car usage across the world is becoming more and more porular, as people finally come to realize the devastating effects of the greenhouse gas emissions on the atmosphere. Projects in places like France, Colombia, the United States, and other countries across the globe are making a huge effort at reducing car usage, and according to source 4 by Rosenthal, they seem to be working. "" Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by""(paragraph 29). Obviously, car usage altogether will not end, but limiting it can do a great deal in protecting the only planet sustainable for human life.

Furthermore, limiting the use of cars in areas of large pedestarian population, such as New York City, would ultimately lead to less tragic car accidents. Approximately 500 car accidents occur daily in the United States and probably upwards of 5000 across the globe. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in many societies which is unfortunate because almost all are preventable. Its when the driver is given too much power behind the wheel that their guard is let down. The rise of cellphones and texting have not helped the situation at all either. The good news is that the programs used worldwide solely for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are also reducing car accidents. "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (Duffer, paragraph 14). Also in source 3 describing Bogota's Car free day is spreading to other countries of Latin-America with the intention of reducing traffic and allowing safer passage for pedestrians.

Ultimately, the importance of limiting car-usage across the world is being seen as crucial and is starting to take off. Limiting car usage reduces air pollution which is a serious threat to humanity these days, and also diminishes car related accidents. At the end of my trip to California, I was able to see the real beauty of the nature outside the city, when I got off the highway.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I don't think that you should change the school grade average to a B for sports and other activities because some student are not use to scoring that high. I'm sure they can if they really put all they got in their school work but you changing it will make them think that the expectations are too high and my not want to participate in any school activities. With no activities to enter in for the students then our school can not compete in events with other schools thus for no accomplishments, such as championships rating the school. When student with a high G.P.A that all so like to participate in school activities, are looking for schools to go to and they see ours they may not want to consider it. You know even if those things such as sports, kids want to be the next Michael Jordan or Tom Brady cause those people influence them.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"A man approaches a sleek new vehicle, he enters and the car starts still with his hands at his sides the vehicle begins to accelerate and turns on to a street as the man sits calmly. Self driving cars... an odd thought, however these vehicles may no longer be a fictional things seen in a cartoon or popular film. Right now developers across the globe are working towards a Self operating vehicle, one that could change the lives of people everywhere for the better. These ""Driverless Cars"" could prevent dangerous accidents, allow the driver to enjoy a safe and easy trip, as well as save precious fuel while cutting down polution.

Driverless cars programmed to obey and follow the rules of the road all while keeping its passengers safe. The average licenesed individual has been in or witnessed an accident, and they know how horrifying and potentially hurtful one can be. That can be stopped the new technology being developed can allow the cars to follow all driving laws, allow the passenger to take over in a state of emergency, and if the streets are filled with these law abiding vehicles there will be virtually no violations that could result in a fatal or harmful accident. Where as drivers today panic, drink and drive, as well as text and drive which leads to several hundreds of innocent lives lost every year.

Imagine sitting back relaxing listening to a great song that just came on not having to worry about other cars around you beacuse the one your in can handle itself. If these new revolutionary vehicles are allowed to take the streets constant worry of unsafe drivers will be deminished. Crash and acident rates would be at an all time low and travel would be so much more enjoyable. Yes these vehicles in there current state may ask for the drivers help every once in awhile, but the Google car drove 500,000 miles accident free, Remarkable.

Finally they would allow us to save and cut down on fuel use, and with supplies fading this could be a huge factor in saving what reserves we have left. They also could be powered by electricity which would remove the fuel factor as a whole and reduce polution rates to a minimal. Earth provides the human population with everything we need and have today. What better way to repay it then to save it from the harmful polution cars produce everyday.

In conclusion Driverless Cars are the cars of the future. Providing us with nothing but benefits if allowed on the roads of The united states and roads across the world. Saving lives, preventing the death of innocent people, allowing safe passage for the passenger, and cutting down on fuel use and polution. Driverless cars are the cars of the future and could provide peoplke with much better lives if allowed. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Most people disagreee on the idea of taking away cars or creating fuel effeicent cars. One idea that can possibly top all those is a limited car usage society. Natiosn worldwide have vbegun starting a new trend/ orsmartplanning which limits cars usage due to the ecomony ,pollution it creates.

To begin with, limiting cars is becoming a new fad, people in  VAUBAN,Germany(Dorchland) say  it saves alot of time and money. Now you can just have your house in the suburbs and just stick to foot traffic youdont have to worry about car insurance or garages or keeping drive ways clean. No more dirty streets clean and motor sound free walking. With this new smart planning going on its harder for people to take there kids around and get to work. What goes along with this effect it saves people more money.

Lastly, Limiting usage of cars is going to help better the enviorment. Recently paris was under an enforced ban due to to a cloud of smog pollution. The use of cars releases toxi and bad gases into the atomosphere destroying are enviorment and causing effects on the polar ice caps. The limit use of cars cuts traffic down and time. another effect use we could use is a car free day were we could take buses , bicycles , and even skateboards. one major thing we should replace with our cars is public transports.

Inconclusion

Limiting cars usage is helpful and becoming more popular globally it can help the economy and also help slow down pollution.                                                            ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Community service should be a revered thing.

Many people are forced to do it if they are facing probation or are already on it.

I don't believe that is the correct thing to do.

Without these people many community service projects would be neglected, but it is still slightly haunting to think about the fact that humans(Americans especially) do not care enough to take care of the other inhabitants of Earth, and sometimes even the Earth itself!

I don't believe that community service should be a requirement but instead a choice.

I consider the option of the student being able to receive extra credit in school for it a very good idea.

If the students of this school need to participate in community service so be it, but you should give them the choice of saying no while making the choice of saying yes so good that it should be nigh impossible to refuse.

If community service is imposed on students there is a chance they will purposely NOT do it.

The students age heavily depend on this.

People at this age are natural rebels, they don't want to do what'd asked of them, and it doesn't matter if its for their good or not.

If you make it sound like there idea or it's not REALLY required they will probably be more accepting to the fact that they are going to have to do it one way or another.

Either way it goes I think that community service is a great idea with great possibilities and that students SHOULD be involved in it.

"The ""face"" on Mars was first found it was in 1976, at first it was said that the face was made from an alien or aliens once there. NASA belives it was just a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" NASA finaly unveiled the image for everyone to see a dew days later, thinking it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. It certainly did.

Although few scienctist believed the face was an alien artifact, photagraphing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Blobal Suveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Spet. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking mission ended. ""We felt this was important to taxpayers,"" explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. ""We photographed the face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.""

On April 5, 1998 Mars Gobal Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera tea, snapped a picture ten ties sharoer than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxiuos web surfers were waiting when a the image first apeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year in the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia."" says Garvin. ""In fact it's hard work."" On April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia MGS drew close enough for a second look. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptain-style pyramids or even smaller shacks, you could see what they were!"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

From the informtion given here it's proven that the ""Face on Mars"" was not created or signs of an alien or aliens on Mars. The ""face"" was just a natural landform just like here in Earth.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The Electoral College is a really good process that I think they should keep. This Electoral college was found by the founding fathers and it is used so that the citizens could vote and the congress. The citizens get to have the right to vote on who they want to be presidant. After everyone voted the votes are counted up in each state and it shows which states voted for different people. The congress have a meeting of the electors and get to all vote. All votes for the congress are counted out seperatly then citizens. This is a the start of why I think Electoral College is fair and equal all around.

In order for the Electoral College to elect a presidant they need 270 votes out of 538 Electors. Each state or country has electors in them. The candidates running for presidant have their own electors. Every 4 years a presidential election is held at the same time on tuesday after the first monday of novemeber. When voting for the candidates you are basically voting for the candidates electors. After voting in the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment,"" which is the list of the candidates who ran for presidant. Also, it shows who the winning candidate is in each state. Lastly the certificate is sent to the states congress to keep for records.

There are mainly 5 reasons in why the Electoral College should stay. First is the Certainty of Outcome which shows that there cant be a dispute because it is based on popular vote. The next reason is Everyone is Presidant, this means that the presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. Another reason is Swing Sates which is the winner take all method. They are usually whatching campaigns and really listen to the other candidates, thoses poeple are usually thoughtfull voters. The next great reason is Big States, this shows if you win a big state then you win more electoral votes and each big state has more electoral votes. The last reason is Avoid Run Off Elections, this avoids the problem of no candidates recieves a majority of the votes in the east.

Their are alot of great reasonings about electoral college but there are some bad reasonings to. Voters dont vote for the presidant when they vote, they vote for the elcectors and the electors vote for the presidant. This can mean that even if you voted for the specific presidant your vote shows you voted for the 30 or so congress people voting for presidant. What if there was a tie in the electoral vote then the election would be for the House of Representitves where they vote for presidant. The 55 representitive votes are equal to 35 million voters. This shows that the electoral college can be bad for the voters.

After reading the article and going over it I believe that the Electoral College is a great idea. There are many great things about but then there are things that you dislike about it. Not everything can be perfect but the Electoral College is trying to get that way. The presidant is still getting voted every 4 years and hopefully it stays like that for a very long time. Those were all my reasons on why I thought the Electoral College is the right way to go.            ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Imagine having to go home from school to have to do your homework, and then picking up your sibling from elementary school, then making dinner for them all while your both your parents are working.

You go to bed at 11 every night to wake up at 6 to go to school.

Now your principal is requiring one extracurricular activity for each student. How are you going to fit that into your already busy schedule?

I don't think that the principal should require students to participate in one extracurricular activity.

I think this because some students do not have the time to add another activity into the day, school should not control your personal life, and although some students might be doing the bare minimum, that doesn't mean other students aren't trying hard in school.

To start off, students should not be required to have one extracurricular activity because some students do not have the time to add another extracurricular activity into their day.

Although some activities might be in school, they add on more work and stress to the student.

Some students struggle to complete homework by their bedtime everyday.

Some students do not even finish their homework until around one in the morning.

Those students also have to wake up around 6 to go back to school.

That comes out to about 6 hours of sleep when they should be getting 8 or 9 hours of sleep.

The situation for every student is different.

For example, a student might have to take care of a younger sibling and tend to the house while both the parents work. Do you think that this is fair?

Reason number two for the principal not requiring a extracurricular activity for each student.

School should not be able to control your personal life along with your school life.

There is a border between your personal and school life.

Time is a precious thing.

If one extracurricular activity equals around 1-2 hours, then that will mean you will finish you homework two hours later, and that means you will have less free time to hang out and relax.

So, instead of going to that movie or dinner with your friends, you have to do homework and study.

School already takes up 6+ hours of your day, how much longer can they make it?

My final reason that students should not have to add an extracurricular activity to their day is that some students are already working hard for their age and some students are not privileged like other students.

Their families might be struggling to make ends meet every day and they might have to work a job just so their siblings can eat dinner.

They are already hardworking and shouldn't have to work more just because the principal wants to require this.

Adding this activity will just add more stress to the student.

The school is not aware of everyone's situation. I do not think that these hardworking students deserve this.

In conclusion, the principal should not require an extracurricular activity because some students are too busy to add another activity into the day, your personal life is separate from your school life, and the principal should not be able to add more work on to the stressed, hardworking students.

"Using cars today is polluting the air we breath in everyday, worse and wrose. Having a world free of cars would not only help with air pollution, but with everyone's saftey as well. In German Suburds 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move in the German Suburb. They would sell thier car(s), and live without a car, and live a less stressful life. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two. I'm sure Heidrun wasn't the only one who felt like that.

Having no car wouldd take more stress of your life then you think. You wouldn't have to pay a car payment every month. You wouldn't have to worry about hvaing to pay for gas to get around. Lastly you wouldn't have to worry about getting into a car accident every time you got behind the wheel of a car.

""All of our development since World war ll has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" said David Goldberg. Goldberg is right. We put most of our attention and development into cars, and focus more on them than we really should. We don't really realize what damage cars are causing us yet, and probably won't realize for a long time from now.

Aftrer days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with even numbered license plates were orded to leave thier cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. The same would apply to odd number plates the following day. They should not only be doing this in Paris but everywhere to reduce the air pollution. The fine should be higher also to those who don't follow the rules. Unless you havea real emergency to use your car the day you are not suppose to then don't use it.

Not using cars would be a huge problem solver to most of us. It will help with air pollution. It will help with finacial problems by not having to worry about car payments or money for gas. Lastly it will help wiith the stress in people's lives and lower it.             ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The role a car plays in the life of an individual has made changes through out the years. There never was a significant meaning to having a car; it just meant having a vehicle that can get you from point A to point B. As the human society continues to progress with the creations of technology, the use of cars has diminished greatly in different parts of the world. Not being able to use a car seems like there is no bright side, but there are actually many advantages on limiting car usage.

The United States always had this recognition of being one of the world's prime car cultures. ""The first Model T cars were born in the U.S. It has also been the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized 'Mustang Sally."" President Barack Obama identifies in the article,

The End of Car Culture, his dreams for the U.S ""to curb the United State's geen house gass emissions will get a forturious assist from an incipent shift in American behavior."" Going back to the article as reference, studies show ""americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by... as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak... there was also a drop in percent of 16- to 39- year olds getting a license."" The cause of the downfall in car usage can be pointed towards a few factors; internet making telecommuting possible, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of cellphones and car-pooling apps. It is not because society assumes cars are becoming of no use, the role of technological improvements are making things a lot easier than how things were in the 1960's. The United states has the option of using cars or not, in other places like Paris, the option to drive has become a choice made out of a person's own power.

Paris, France is a location that anyone dreams of visiting. The city is beautiful but the levels of smog have made it impossible for people to enjoy the views of the city. According to the article,

Paris bans driving due to smog , ""it has been enforced to the citizens of a partial driving ban in order to clear the air... people were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine which is $31 in the United States."" The way things are organized in Paris goes by a person's license plate number. In correlation to the article, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifiying smog."" However, not all of the cars used in Paris, France were banned. Those cars that are plug-ins, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers were allowed to roam the street of Paris. A good majority, 67 percent, of vehicles in France are made up of diesel, and that kind of fuel were the ones to blame since gasoline was not in favor in a city like that one. In the same way, places like Bogota, Colombia, had similar situations as the peolpe that live in France.

In the country of Colombia there has been a day dediated to doing things with no car; it's a car-free day. In contrast to how banning driving is in Paris, Bogota, Colombia has everyone participate in this 24 hour event. If a person were to violate the rule they are to face $25 fines. The article,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, explains that ""millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during the car-free day."" Just like the goals in Paris, Colombia has goals to promote alternatice transportation and reduce smog. A businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, explains ""it's  good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" No one would everythink that driving is as stressful as going to work. When put into mind, things begin to make sense. The early mornings of road rage people encounter makes their entire day a little more stressful than what it should be. Driving is a wonderful advantage but there is always more than just a car. Colombia's main goal, as expressed in the article ""is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.""

In the end of it all cars have always been in the making; trying to find new ways to improve and modernize. Although cars may have had significant meanings in the older times, as society continues to prosper in technological making, cars are beginning to be identified as material objects that are not as important. They are just in use for people to get from one place to the next when other things are not working.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Summer, the time every student looks forward to after being in school for several months. Unfourtanetly certain schools are requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they're continuing to learn during their break. There is a debate whether or not the assignments should be teacher-designed or student-designed. The assignments should be student-designed because their summer is already being interrupted by school projects, so the students having freedom with the project will motivate them to do it, the project will be more enjoyable because it will be a topic they like, and it will allow creativity.

Students will be disappointed that they go to school for roughly ten months out of the year, and the two months they do have off are filled with school related assignments. That's why having a student-designed project will allow the students to take a different perspective of the assignment. The students having a choice will motivate them to do the project because it will be something they enjoy. Most summer based assignments would be reading a teacher chosen novel and doing an assignment based off of it. No student wants to spend their summer reading a novel they don't find an interest in and then writing a paper about it. However they wouldn't necessarily mind doing an assignment if it corresponds with the vacation they're going on and a school subject they enjoy. Giving students a choice allows them to dig deeper and the outcome will be greater and it will allow a greater amount of success.

Another reason the summer projects should be student-designed is that students will find more joy in working with an assignment they like. Every student is different therefore they will appreciate the fact they get to do a project that appeals to them. This will also allow the teachers to learn about their students more at the beginning of the year, what they like, and what works for them. Students need a break to relax and let their brain interpret all the information they have learned during the previous school year, so loading them down with assignments is not going to help them recover. Having a student-designed project will give students the opportunity to learn and think about school but at the same time not be overwhelmed and have a negative outlook towards doing the project for school.

Having a student-designed assignment also allows the students to get creative and expand learning outside of the classroom. It will allow the teachers to see what the students are capable of. Additionally the teachers would enjoy grading the projects because all of them would be different. However the teachers will disagree and want a teacher-designed assignment because they will want the project to be organized and structured. Teachers would want to make sure effort is being put into the project and the students are retaining information from it. There will be many assignments during the school year for the teachers to plan assignments so during the break the students should be trusted to design their own.

Summer is what every student looks forward to, the fun vacations and plans they have. They're not going to want to complete a dreadful assignment. The students should be held capable of designing their own summer project so they will have more motivation to complete it, they will be able to find joy in it, and they will be able to think with an open-mind and become creative.         ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"In the article ""Driverless Care Are Coming"" the author presents to the reader a set of positive and negatibe aspects of driveless cars. The driveless cars are cars that do not need a huamn to drive/control the wheel while on the road. These cars are able to drive for you, and give you a better way of getting places safer and more effective. There are problems as well with the cars; shown in the paragrapghs below, you will see why driverless cars are not the future of cars.

""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" made many great points on why driverless cars are a good for the people in the world, but they also stated some very good points on why it would not be. For example, in the article it says the cars are very expensive due to the work that would have to be done to the roads and the cars themselves for them to work corectly. In paragraph four it states ""For starters, they needed a while lot of sensors."" meaning that the car itself would need more added to make sure it was effective which technically cost more money. Not only is money an issue but the fact that driverless cars will taking the skill of driving away from people. As you get older you start to learn how to drive and get to learn all of the rules of the road, but with a driverless car you will most likely not have to learn how to drive. Not knowing how to drive leads to not learning the rules of the road which will lead to more accidents and lawsuits.

Drivelss cars are the future of cars. Yes, maybe, but as said in the article they still have not found a fully effective driveless car the does not need the help of a human when it comes close to danger or something unfamiliar. As said in paragraph seven ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driveless."" this shows that even with more developed technology they still have not made a fully effective driverless car. The whole point of a driverless car is so the person behind the wheel techinically does not have to drive. Another example is that the drivers must stay alert whcih makes the car even less of a big deal because as said before, the car is not technically driverless. If they want these cars to be the future they need to develope a truly effective car, not just a semi-effecive car.

Another reason why the driverless car is not a car that should be made is because with a driverless car there is no one technically to blame for an acident because the car was not driven by anyone but itself. In paragraph nine the article says ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver of the manufacturer?"" this shows the car is only made to drive not to protect what is beyond. The manufacturer should be more invested on how to change the fact that it will not be one- hundred percent and change how safe the car actually is. An example that brought attention was in paragraph ten when the author of the article said ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percebt of the time"" still shows how the car is not truly a driverless car which means that the car name itself is false advertising. That wilol also lead to lawsuits becasue it is not what the consumer/buyer was looking for when they heard the name ""driverless car"".

The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" made many great points on why or why not a driverless car is a good car. Reading the article there were many points that stood out about why the car would not be a good car, than to why it would be a good car. To sum up the driverless car is a car that still is not always effective which can bring harm to the people inside of the car and the people beyond the car. Driverless cars are taking away the fact that as a person driving is a skill you must learn, not just get it handed to you because you have a ""driverless"" car. To conclude the driverless car is not a good car and more people should not support the idea.             ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal,

If my principal is considering to change the policy that students have to have a B grade average or above I would go to a school that didn't have that policy but had a policy that I would like.

I don't think that's fare for just students that got a C average grade and that can't play sports. If they are passing the grade to go to the next grade why can they not play sports if that are passing with a D or above that average. I would write a letter to the principal and tell him not to do that or I will tell all my friends at this school that we will miss with you until you get tied of being miss with. I would have a fit about the school policy that the principal was changing about you must have a B grade average to play sports. I think he should change the policy you must have a C grade average to play any kind of sports. If C is a average grade why want you lit them play there sport at what they are good at so when they get to collage they would know some moves and learn how to play good ever more.

"Dear Principal,

A large majority of students in our school have cell phones. Cell phones are big now because of texting, chatting, emailing and whatever other stuff a phone can do. They are a great way to communicate with other people. Maybe you want to meet someone somewhere it's easy enough to just pick up your phone and send the person a quick text message or call. Lots of teenagers have them. But cell phones are also a major cause of problems. I do not think you should allow kids to have their phone on them during school hours.

There are bullies in every school no matter where you go, there will always be some sort of bully. They take can take embarrassing pictures or videos of you and send it out. It will spread like wild fire once you take that video and send it out to even one person. But a lot of the time bullies take these pictures/videos on their phones because that is all they have handy. They can take an inappropriate picture of you and send it out. During school someone could take out their phone and take a picture or video of you doing something when you really don't want your picture or video taken. People have killed themselves over getting bullied because there is a picture out there of them that they personally don't like and wish no one had ever seen. Well that picture can originate from a bullies cell phone. It's easy enough to take a quick picture and send it out. If you were to let kids have their phones that might happen more often.

On the other hand, another reason why I don't think you should let us kids have our cell phones is because it will distract from someone learning and that is what school is all about. If someone had their phone they would most likely text one of their friends. Therefore they are distracted from the lesson the teacher is trying to teach and they will not get what is going on in that class. Also I have seen people text each other answers to a test. This is very common for students to do because they do not know what is going on because during that lesson they were to busy on their phone or just being distracted. Texting another person the answers to a test or quiz is cheating.

Yes, I would love to have my phone to text all my friends but there are more important things like learning. Again, I do not think you should let us kids have our cell phones with us because it will lead to bullying and also cheating. It can lead to many other things, but those two are the main problems of having a cell phone on during class.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"All students dislike getting up early for a long school day every weekday. Many wish that they could stay in bed all day. But that is not a reality. Students would not benefit through online schooling because it doesn't prepare them for the real world, they don't learn as much, and it could potentially be bad for their health.

Online schooling doesn't provide kids with the face to face interactions that they need in order to learn normal social skills. If they are stuck behind a computer all day, they are alone with no real interaction. It also doesn't teach students how to get up at a reasonable time to start their days. They get up as they please and could have trouble learning time management. People use time management every day, and with online school they aren't ever going to learn it.

Secondly, students can be dishonest when completing assignments. A lot of students don't care about the learning aspect, but about the grade. They only care about the grade because that's what their parents care about. Students will do anything to get an ""A"", so that their parents are proud. Many students will cheat on assignments in order to fulfill their parents expectations. It makes it very easy for a student to cheat with no supervision from a teacher. The student learns nothing by cheating and taking the easy way out. With the rise in technology, many students have two or three different devices which makes it very easy for them to cheat.

Lastly, sitting at home for online classes could be very harmful to the students health. With the amount of obesity in the world, the last thing we want is for more kids to be sitting at home taking online courses instead of being at a conventional school. Many online programs have no sports teams, giving kids almost no way to get exercise throughout the day, which is needed in order to live a healthy life. Obesity isn't the only way that online school can harm students' health. It is incredibly bad for your eyes to be looking at a screen for seven hours. Students need a break from screens when at school.

Many people might make the argument that online school is cheaper as a whole, ultimately making it a better option. Although it may be cheaper for counties, we shouldn't take the cheaper route when we're talking about the future of our country. These students will be the future of America, and we need them to be knowledgeable and healthy men and women.

In conclusion, online school would hurt students more than it would help them. Students need interaction with other students even if it is for brief moments throughout the day. Conventional school also provides students with a healthy learning environment that can prepare them for success. Online school won't prepare students for their future, they are less likely to learn, and it is unhealthy.",0,persuade_corpus,4

I participated in school role-plays to develop my confidence, and took part in fun and safe science experiments to increase my attention and focus.

With a positive mindset and an eagerness to learn, I embraced all these opportunities and used them to develop new skills and become a better version of myself.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"A mission of going to Venus is impossible for us, well atleast right now. In the future there is probably going to be a very high chance to visit the Earth like planet but right now, I don't see the possibilty of that happening. I think our focus should be exploring Mars, I think it's a more realistic mission. The author does have some good evidence to back up on why there's a possibility to explore Venus.

The author said that Venus is Earth's ""twin"" and that is true! Venus is the, ""closest planet to Eartth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."". Venus probably had what Earth has right now which are oceans. Even now, Venus is similar to Earth in terms of surface. The planet has a rocky surface and sediment and also similar valleys, mountains, etc but it's not all good stuff about Venus, the planet also has enviroments that are not suitable for human life and I don't think it will anytime soon in my life time. The author does talk about it and gives facts on why it's hard to explore Venus. It has ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"". The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid, the surface of Venus is a flaming 800+ degrees Fahrenheit. That's hot! The pressure alone is 90 times greater than Earth. A submarine accustomed to dive into our deep ocean would be crushed on the Venus surface. We won't be able to see through the thick clouds even if we hovered the planet. Therefore, it would be nearly impossible to et samples of anything!

After all, I think NASA and other private rocket organizations should just focus on going to Mars which like Venus, it's going to be hard. They should see it as a challenge which im sure they do but Mars should be our focus. The author gave good reasons on why we should and shouldn't explore Venus. Which ever planet gets explored first really won't matter. It's history being made for humans and that's what matters in my opinion.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The principal should allow students to bring cell phones to school. He should let them use it during lunch periods and other free time. As long as they turn them of during class time or any other learning time. I think the students are old and responsible. To let them use there phones during lunch or any other free time. They should know when to use the phones.

Students should be able to use there phones during there free time. It is there free time and they should know what there going to do with it. Either walk around talk or what ever they like to do or use there phones. They are old already and they what there doing. That's why the principal should let the students. Use there phones during there free time.

The principal should also let the students use there phones during there lunch periods. There the ones that are having there lunch. There not learning there just having fun with there friends and eating. So there is no reason to not let students use there phones. During there lunch time they should know if there going to eat or not. So there is the other reason why you should let the students. Use there phones during there lunch period.

So why not let the students use there phones. During there free time or lunch time. If there not learning there just having fun. They just will have to turn them of when they have to learn. They are old and responsible to let them use there phones. So that's why you should let students use there phones when there not learning. You should really let them use there phones during there time.

"Historically, children have only been able to receive an education by traveling to a building known as a school. In this building, there are classrooms, desks, boards, teachers, etc., but most importantly, the outlet to a successful future. Over time, more and more developments have been made in order to improve the quality of the curriculum that students learn in school. With the rise of technology, even the location of schooling has begun to vary with the addition of a unique option: learning from home. Online video conferences and other such facilities allow for students to access the same materials that they would be given at a traditional school. However, as convenient as it seems, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, which is portrayed by the lack of three things that are vital to academic achievement: student discipline, teacher connection, and test regulation.

First and foremost, being able to attend classes from home would result in a lack of student discipline. Learning from home would discourage students from maintaining a strict schedule that would normally be upheld in a school building. For example, Generic_Name, a sixth grader, takes classes from home. The year before, he used to wake up at 6:00 every morning to get ready for school, which started at 8:00. Now, he wakes up around 9:00, because he only has four 90-minute classes to attend via video. While he may be able to get more sleep at night, Generic_Name has not established a routine for his school work, so he wastes hours before and in between classes. This leads to him not having enough time to spend with his loved ones or exercise, all because he has the leisure to slack off during the day. Consequently, there is not only a decrease in efficiency, but also in productivity, which is an outcome of the ability to attend classes from home. These are qualities of discipline, which is an indicator of success in the future.

Secondly, the direct connection to teachers would be lost if students were able to attend classes from home. In other words, students would not be able to ask their teachers any questions they might have in person. Although the video conferencing software might include a messaging system for students to communicate with their teachers, it does not replicate the same level of understanding that a student might gain if they were able to speak directly to their teacher. For instance, students who need clarification of certain material may not receive an adequate explanation online because their teacher's attention may be divided or focused on some other task. Additionally, in person, students would be able to ask follow-up questions and have a thorough discussion with their teacher, whereas a messaging system might not allow for steady communication due to breaks between answers. Therefore, there may be gaps in students' learning, which could contribute to poor performance in their classes.

Last but not least, the regulation of tests is lowered when students have the ability to attend classes from home. When assessing students' learning in a tradtional school, teachers normally provide them with hard copies of multiple-choice or short answer questions that require students to write with a pencil or pen. With advancements in technology, however, tests are increasingly being administered through software to both avoid the wastage of paper and facilitate the process of grading. Learning from home usually requires students to take all of their tests online rather than on paper, which becomes problematic when there is no teacher or reliable adult proctoring the administration. This allows for cheating and other dishonest behaviors to occur, thereby decreasing the credibility of the scores of students taking tests from home. Test regulation is necessary for schools to accurately assess the academic performance of students, so a lack thereof is detrimental to society.

In conclusion, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to the lack of student discipline, teacher connection, and test regulation. A combination of one or more of these factors can lead to a student not meeting the standards of learning, or even worse, the requirements for graduation from school. At home, students are not monitored regularly as they are at school, which is a breeding ground for incomplete lessons and assignments. Subsequently, grades plummet, and in many cases, so does the motivation to excel. In order for education to fulfill its purpose, students should attend school in a building separate from their home. By doing so, they would be subject to the benefits of character cultivation, as they learn not only the subjects normally taught in a curriculum, but also the value of hard work and its upward path to accomplishment in life. ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Students shouldn't need at least a grade B average just to participate in sports or activities. What if they have like a grade C or D average? They should still be able to participate in sports.

What if they're actually really trying to get good grades but they aren't getting the good grades that they want?

They should still be able to participate so they can have fun and participate in sports with they're friends. They should be able to join if they want too join. So again, students should be able to join in sports and activities if they want too. What if they are good at that sport or activity and you're losing out a good player or student who also just wants to have fun and be with their friends'? Students shouldn't have to get very good grades just to participate in a sport or activity.

You should at least put up a flyer and see who wants to sign up for the program and if there are to many students who want to sign up, then choose students who have the better grades. If the students you chose who have the better grades aren't athletic or energetic then choose an athletic and energetic student who wants to actually try and be good at something. You should at least try and be fair to other students who want to actually play something or do something that's energetic and fun. You shouldn't choose someone just because they have good grades, choose someone because they're good at something or want to be good at something.            ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The pursuit of a professional career is an essential aspect of life for many individuals. It is a path that can lead to financial stability, personal growth, and the ability to contribute positively to society. As a student, it is my responsibility to consider this path and to make a conscious effort to pursue a career that aligns with my passions and interests.

A professional career can provide numerous benefits to individuals and their families. First and foremost, it can provide a stable source of income. This can be especially important for families, as it can help to ensure that everyone has access to basic necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare. Additionally, a professional career can provide opportunities for personal growth and development. This can include learning new skills, gaining new experiences, and developing a sense of self-worth.

However, it is important to recognize that the pursuit of a professional career also comes with potential risks. For example, it is possible to become so focused on achieving success in one's career that other important aspects of life, such as relationships and personal well-being, may be neglected. Additionally, the pressure to succeed in one's career can lead to stress and anxiety, which can have negative impacts on both physical and mental health.

As a student, it is my responsibility to consider these potential risks and to make a conscious effort to balance my career aspirations with my other responsibilities. This may involve setting realistic goals, prioritizing self-care, and seeking support from friends, family, and mentors.

"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For my essay, I'm gonna investigate school systems that have extended days and see how they affect students, parents, and teachers. I'll consider the pros and cons of a 4-day, 10-hour model and decide if our school should do it too! 🤔

First off, let's talk about the school systems that have already implemented extended days. Some schools in Japan, like the Kakogawa Municipal Kakogawa Elementary School, have a 6-day school week with longer hours. This allows students to focus more on their studies and get more done in less time. Plus, it helps teachers plan better lessons and give more individual attention to students. 📚👨‍🏫

However, there are also some downsides to extended days. For example, some students might find it hard to adjust to the longer school hours, especially if they have other commitments like sports or clubs. And parents might have to adjust their work schedules to accommodate their kids' longer school days. 🤷‍♀️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Another option is the 4-day, 10-hour model that some schools have tried. This means students attend school for longer periods of time, but have more breaks throughout the day. This can be helpful for students who have trouble focusing or need more time to process information. Plus, it gives teachers more time to plan and prepare engaging lessons. 📝🎉

But, just like with any change, there are pros and cons to this model too. For instance, some students might find it hard to adjust to having fewer days off, and parents might worry about the extra time their kids spend at school. 🤔👀

So, should our school implement an extended day model? Well, after researching and thinking about it, I think it could be a good idea! 🤓📝 Having more time in school means students can learn more and get more individual attention from teachers. Plus, it could help us get better grades and prepare for standardized",1,llama2_chat,2
"Title: The Importance of Challenging Yourself and Pursuing Your Dreams

Introduction:

In his famous quote, Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This statement highlights the importance of stepping out of your comfort zone and pursuing your dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem. In this essay, I will discuss the process of achieving your goals, the importance of trying new things, and how people may limit themselves by not challenging themselves.

Step 1: Researching Your Dreams

The first step in achieving your dreams is to research and understand what it takes to get there. This may involve reading books, talking to people who have already accomplished what you want to achieve, or even taking classes or workshops to gain the necessary skills. By gathering information and knowledge, you will be better equipped to make informed decisions and take action towards your goals.

Step 2: Brainstorming Ideas

Once you have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve, the next step is to brainstorm ideas on how to get there. This may involve breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable steps, or creating a timeline of when you want to achieve each step. By having a clear plan in place, you will be able to stay focused and motivated as you work towards your goals.

Step 3: Outlining the Process

With your ideas in mind, the next step is to outline the process of how you will achieve your goals. This may involve creating a list of the resources you will need, such as time, money, and support from others. It may also involve identifying potential obstacles and developing strategies to overcome them. By having a clear plan in place, you will be better prepared to take action and make progress towards your goals.

Step 4: The Importance of Hard Work

While it's true that nothing is impossible, it's also true that hard work is necessary to achieve your goals. Success is not simply handed to you; it requires dedication, perseverance, and a willingness to put in the time and effort to make your dreams a reality. By working hard and never giving up, you will be able to overcome any obstacles that may arise and achieve the success you desire.

"I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school because it is an excellent way to find interests in leisure time, improve people's social and health lives, and it has an important role in serving the community and academic success.

First of all, many students, especially teenagers, spend a vast amount of time on social medias and cellular devices. It may lead to negative consequences such as lack of self-control and self-management, imperfect grades, and even cyberbullying. Before students become mature enough to handle their own situations, adults should be the supervisors and help them get on the right track. Sometimes it is acceptable to force people to on a certain task for their own benefits. Therefore, extracurricular activities is a great option when it comes to after school life. Students may seek their true interests through these experiences and even more, find the purpose of their lives. For instance, a student who participates in a the student council may find a big interest in politics or management; another student who works on the yearbook might seek a great favor in arts and photography. Moreover, there is a possibility that some people can target what they want to major in for the future.

Additionally, extracurricular activities may contribute to students' health and social lives by creating opportunities such as teamwork and group projects. Besides focusing on school grades, students should also pay attention on developing relationships and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, all of these are going to be helpful for having great experiences in the society. Many students crave for a sense of belonging and they often find unexpected gains in extracurricular activities such as friendship or a healthy life style. For example, playing sports can exercise your body and strengthen your muscles, when people get older, it can even prevent typical diseases for a longer life span. Also, sport teams often develop communication and teamwork skills, through these activities, students are able to make new friends by talking about topics that they are interested in, and these relationships can also be a source of strength when people come into challenges and difficulties in life. It is a positive way for students to be physically and mentally prepared for the future.

Furthermore, extracurricular activities is a nice way to contribute to the school and it can even be beneficial to academic success. School provides an educational environment for students and students can participate in activities such as school board or the announcements and news program to serve back to the school. In a way, it has the same meaning and purpose as community service, it advocates for serving others and offers many experience that are helpful to the society. On the other hand, participating in extracurricular activities may serve as a great advantage in high school or college applications, every school looks forward to accepting students who are willing to spend effort on things that they are interested in, and at the same time know the importance of serving back to the community.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities have many benefits for students' academic and after school lives such as finding one's personal interests, adding more values to one's social and health life, and lastly, serving the community while being grateful for nice things in the world. With all these advantages, I think it would be a beneficial decision to suggest students to engage in extracurricular activities.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"People tend to use there cars so much, they basically can't live or get through the day with out their car. We use the car to go every where rather it's to the grocery store , work or just to go hang out with friends and family! Just traveling in general. Well imagine if we limited the usage of cars in our community! I strongly believe that doing this would have many advantages to our community for many reasons like it will make people less stressful all the time, there would be less accidents and it would definitly be better for the environment.

OMG I ran out of gas or OH my i have to take my car to the shop to get it fixed is usually the two main things you hear people stay when the word ""car"" comes up. Having a car comes with alot of stress because it of expenses and having to take of its every need and usually when someone is stressed they are not the best person you wanna have a conversation with. I think that if we limit the usage of cars a lot of people in the community will be alot happier. According to the article

""Car-free Cities""

by

Elisabeth Rosenthal in source 2 a lady name Heidrun Walter says "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" and i think that is a perfect example of limited car usauage can make a person happier.

In addition, I feel that if that if we limit the car usage in our community it will make this community a much safer environment. We hear and see about many car accidents in our country and community and cars can be very very dangerous. People often get injuried and/or die in car recks to. So limitting the car usage in the communitry will keep people more safe and most importantly alive . Kids will be able to run aroumd the neighborhood and play with their friends and also cross the street safely without the disruption of a car coming and stopping them from what they are doing  because they do not wants to get hurt from the car coming because they do not know who is driving the car.

Last but not least limiting the use of car usage in the community because it would definitly be better for the environment. In science class we often talk about how cars polute the air and just mess up the waehter in the car and me my self i can also feel the car changing the more i see cars more cars in the streets. I think that it makes the days hotter and i also think that it makes the winters come around earlier and it makes it alot more colder. I live in the Sunshine florida and in the south. So all year round its usually hot extremly hot but has i realize more people are driving around the winers seem ALOT more cold then it usually is and the cold last for longer periods of time.

In conclusion, I belive that if we limit the car usuage in our community it will make it a better place for many reasons. Like it will make people less stressful and  be happier, there will be less accidents on the road and it will also help the environment a lot.                        ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The creation of these car will truly define what our generation is made of. Self-driving cars is a great idea and process, although it may have many faults, it may reduce the risk of car accidents. Driverless cars are a great advance in technology and with the perfect twists and tweaks, these cars could impact our futures majorly. Driverless cars may reduce the risk of accidents, help the driver multitask in a way, and seem very efficent in achieving the goal of changing our future. Self driving cars is a unique idea and it very well may be our future.

Self driving cars could help us reduce the number of accidents. The idea of the car assisting us is a great factor into why these cars could be useful. In paragraph 10 it says, ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" That leaves a little room for the driver to make decisions. That means the driver is still in control. ""The only safe car has a human driver control at all times"" (paragraph 9). The car is not driving itself, it is assisting you in the fact that you are in control of what the car does or doesn't do. With the tweaking of these cars, I feel as if this would be a conveniant idea, and help reduce the causes of car accidents.

Texting and driving is one of the greatest factors to the cause of motor vehicle crashes. The ability the smart car has to help the driver multitask could help if not stop the crashes caused by someone texting or paying attention to something else. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves"" (paragraph 7) With the ability to do practically any driving skill with little help by the driver, this could very well give the ability of multitasking to drivers. Knowing that being able to eat or text while driving and having no troubles may help the effect texting and driving has on cars and drivers.

The self driving car seems like a consistent idea. With technology on the rise we very well could have the perfect car to fix all our problems. All of the car manufacturers are trying their hardest to do what's best for drivers. ""they needed a whole lot of sensors"" (paragraph 4). With the improvements on things like the sensors, this car could be one of the greatest accomplishments ever. ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own"" (paragraph 4). This goes to show that they are taking advantage of the new opportunities they receive each and every day. This use of technology to help the car could help lead to one of the greatest improvements in our era.

With driverless cars, our whole lives could be changed. The reduction of accidents and deaths will drop with these advances. A car that can do the impossible can very well be our future. With these cars and their assistance, the sky is the limit. A very creative thought, that is not only interesting, but efficent in what it does.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The ""Evening Star"" as the author from ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" is another name for venus. Venus known for being inhospitable to humans has been subjected to debate if we should send more explorations to the planet the author of this article thinks so. The author debates that the value of going to venus is worthy despite the dangers and obsticles we face.

A point that the author provides is that Earth is similar to Venus and that we should conduct further studies on the planet. A point that the author makes quite often to show that we can learn about our planet based off learning from Venus, ""Today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters"" (Exploring Venus). from this peice of evidence it is clear that the author is trying to establish a link between earth and venus, That venus is very similar to us so it is worth exploring. Another example of the author connecting earth and Venus is when the author writes about what could of been on Venus ""Long ago, Venus was Probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth"" (Exploring Venus). The wrtitter of this story specifically said ""just like Earth"" because his goal is to establish the scientific evidence that could be gained from going to Venus because it is similar to Earth.

Furthermore the another reason that NASA should send a manned mission to Venus is that it may be the only chance at a expodition to another planet. The author provides information on how close Venus is and how this can be crucial ""occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, Mars, our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimnes we are closer to mars and other times Venus"" (Exploring Venus). The author provided this information to follow up with another quote that comes in a later paragraph. The author follows up on this saying that venus is our the closest planet to us and that going some place closer will lessen space time travel ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (Exploring Venus). This is crucial to have considering that many other planets our very far away making them harder to get to and making them more expensive missoins. So when venus is closer this will increase the support of a trip to evaluate venus because it will be less expensive and easier to get to then a normal space exploration.

How do we finally explore Venus if its worth the pursuit the author describes this as being a challenge but one that we must overcome to explore venus. One way that NASA can over come overcome the challenge of exploring venus is by using technology that is old bulky but most importantly strong. ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions"" (Exploring Venus). This is an important peice of information the author provides to over come the challenge of going to Venus and that we can be saved by technology from the past. Another way NASA could send astronauts to venus is through a giant Blimp in the upper atmosphere of venus ""A Blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roling Venusian landscape"" (Exploring Venus). a blimp is very helpful when it comes to not burning alive on the surface of venus because it is to hot but this approach according to the author also has some set backs. ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal"" (Exploring Venus). This is important to know considering that the authors main point is that we need to actually explore Venus but this hinders us to actually do so which ultimately defeats the whole purpose.

In concluison Venus is a chaotic and hot place unable to support life but the Planet is also worth exploring. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" insist that going to Venus instead of other planets is worth it because the value of going to venus is worth it despite the challenges we face going there, the author presents this claim by explaining that, it is similar to Earth so we can learn about our planet as well as Venus. Also Venus is close so this can save time traveling to it and that we have to overcome challenges to get their but it is ultimately worth going.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Offering students who lives far distance from school an option for them to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing are help students relax at home. Students can have free time for themselves to do other things. Also it a easy way to learn and they are study the same thing as students who go to school. Although people think learning by themselves are useless and complicate. Student would not get any benefit from be attend classes at home. It is actually true because students can be stressful and tired from looking at computer all the time and it can decrease their communicate skill.

Give students who lives far from school an option to learn at home is unnecessary because the schools have a bus service that can take students to school everyday. Make students look in a computer for long time can be stressful and make them feel tired because they have to focus on what they do. They can not go outside and get some fresh air; they have to stay in the room all day and complete their work by watching a video. This offer will pull down students from lots of opportunity that they can get at school.

Learning by online stuff or watching a video are useless and it also can decrease their communicate skill. They will not have time to meet some new people or talk to their friends. Most students have lost focus from learning and they just going to play video game on a computer. Some students have addicted to a video game and not care about learning anymore. Few students might use an application on a computer to scam other people to get money.

To conclude, for students who lives far from school, it is unnecessary for them the attend classes from home. They can not get any benefit at all, but it just going to make them feel stressful and tired from looking at computer.

This offer also decrease the communication between students and other people. If they want to become successful in life, they need to go to school.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Online classes have become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. They offer a number of benefits that can help students achieve their academic goals. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of online classes and analyze how they can help students.

One of the biggest benefits of online classes is flexibility. Students can take classes from anywhere with an internet connection, which means they can learn on their own schedule. This is particularly convenient for students who have other commitments, such as jobs or families. It also means that students can take classes that may not be available in their local area.

Another advantage of online classes is the ability to learn at one's own pace. In traditional classroom settings, students are often required to keep up with the pace of the class, which can be challenging for some. With online classes, however, students can take the time they need to understand the material. This can lead to better learning outcomes and a more enjoyable learning experience.

Online classes also offer a wide range of courses and programs. Whether you're interested in a specific subject or want to pursue a particular career path, there is likely an online class available that can help you achieve your goals. This is especially true for students who may not have access to certain courses in their local area.

However, there are also some disadvantages to online classes. One of the biggest is the lack of interaction with instructors and classmates. In traditional classroom settings, students have the opportunity to ask questions and discuss ideas with their instructors and peers. This can be particularly challenging in online classes, where students may feel isolated and disconnected from the learning community.

Another disadvantage of online classes is the potential for distractions. With the internet readily available, it can be easy to get sidetracked and not focus on the course material. This can lead to poor learning outcomes and a less enjoyable learning experience.

In conclusion, online classes offer a number of benefits that can help students achieve their academic goals. They provide flexibility, the ability to learn at one's own pace, and a wide range of courses and programs. However, there are also some disadvantages to online classes, such as the lack of interaction with instructors and classmates and the potential for distractions. Ultimately, the decision to take online classes should be based on a careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages and",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Okay, sure thing! Here is my essay on the benefits of getting advice from multiple people: 

Advice is something that we all need at some point in our lives. Whether it's on what to wear for a job interview or how to deal with a difficult situation, advice can be incredibly helpful. But have you ever stopped to think about the benefits of getting advice from multiple people?

For one thing, getting advice from multiple people can help you get a more well-rounded perspective on a situation. When you only get advice from one person, you may only hear one side of the story. But when you get advice from multiple people, you can get a more complete picture of what's going on. For example, if you're trying to decide whether to take a job offer, you might ask multiple people you trust for their opinions. You might get some people who think you should take the job, while others might think you should pass. By hearing multiple perspectives, you can make a more informed decision.

Another benefit of getting advice from multiple people is that it can help you identify potential biases. When you only get advice from one person, you might be more likely to fall into the trap of only hearing what you want to hear. But when you get advice from multiple people, you can start to see patterns in their advice. For instance, if multiple people are telling you to be more careful in a certain situation, you might start to realize that there's something you're not seeing.

Finally, getting advice from multiple people can help you build stronger relationships. When you ask multiple people for advice, you're showing them that you value their opinion and trust them enough to seek their advice. This can help strengthen your relationships with these people and build new ones. For example, if you're trying to decide on a college major, you might ask your parents, your guidance counselor, and your favorite teacher for their advice. By seeking their input, you're showing them that you value their opinions and are willing to listen to their advice.

In conclusion, getting advice from multiple people can provide you with a more well-rounded perspective, help you identify potential biases, and build stronger relationships. So the next time you're trying to make an important decision, don't be afraid to ask for advice from multiple people. You might",1,llama2_chat,2
"Hey there!  For this essay, I had to research different types of personality traits and how they can shape our personalities. I mean, who doesn't want to know more about themselves, right? 😅

So, I started by looking up different types of personality traits like extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and so on. I found out that each trait has its own set of characteristics and behaviors that define it. For example, extraverts are outgoing and social, while introverts are more reserved and independent. Agreeable people are easy to get along with, while conscientious folks are organized and responsible.

Next, I asked my friends and family what type of character trait they think I possess. Some said I'm pretty outgoing and social, while others said I'm more reserved and independent. It was interesting to see how different people can have different perspectives on my personality! 🤔

After that, I utilized online resources to learn more about character traits and how they can affect our personalities. I found out that our personality traits can influence how we behave in different social situations and how we interact with others. For instance, if you're an extravert, you might do better in a group setting than someone who's more introverted.

Now, I had to reflect on my own behavior in different social situations and try to figure out which personality type best fits me. I realized that I'm actually a mix of different traits, but I tend to lean more towards being an introvert. I'm not super outgoing or social like some people, but I'm also not super reserved or independent like others. I guess you could say I'm more of a mix-and-match kind of personality! 😅

Lastly, I thought about ways I could strengthen the traits that I already have. I realized that I could work on being more outgoing and social in certain situations, like when I'm around new people or in group settings. I could also try to be more organized and responsible, like a conscientious person, to help me stay on top of my tasks and goals.

In conclusion, researching different types of personality",1,llama2_chat,4

"I have 5 honors classes 3 classes 12 hours of homework and in still required to do a extra circular. I do not actually y have that much work but it feels like it and my principal is adding an extracurricular onto it i disagree with this decision because i makes school too hard for the students it gives the principal teachers and school staff more control over the students life and students might not have enough money to do it

Certain students in the classroom like to get extra credit for college or high school that requires a lot of harder questions increased hours of homework and bigger vocabulary these students some students are overwhelmed as it is adding an extra activity would limit their school work and stretch them thin.

When a student is at school the principal the teachers control what they are allowed to do and where they allowed to do it for 7 hours Monday through Friday. The Students Need some time away from the school. a lot of kids do not even like coming to school if they had another activity forced on them by the school they would skip more. The students wont like to have thing crammed into their schedule by school staff.

Not everyone has same amount of money some people have rich parents some people have poor parents everyone wishes that they had the richest parent but they are just doing their best. Some kids are forced to do thing they dont want to because they dont have enough money to do what they want like i wanted to play hockey with old bu i cant cause i am not rich enough but someone whos even poorer than me is super limited to his extracurricular activities and they will spend hours doing something they dont like

For those reasons i disagree with the principals idea to make extracurricular activities mandatory. I think this idea Hurts certain children and stuns their growth as individuals.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"In the year 2018 technology is advancing as well as schools all around the world. Most kids roll their eyes or yawn or even have a bored/tired look on their face when they're in a classroom that hey dont enjoy. With new technology called FACS(Facial Action Coding System), it will be able to detect when kids are feeling this way.

The computer makes a 3-D model face of a human and have all 44 major musles that operates like human musles, then it scans the face of a real human which will then identify what the person is feeling right now such as happy, sad, tired, scared and many more. Using this type of technology will be very helpful in classrooms because when a student is feeling bored or tired then the computer will be able to detect that the the teacher will be able to make the topic more interesting for the students. Most teachers have about 28 students per class for seven periods everyday which can be very stressful, so it can be very challenging for them to recognize when students are dealing with a certain type of emotion but with the FACS it can recognize that and the teacher will be able to help the student or students.

In conclusion, FACS is an amazing creation that will be able to help students and teachers. Kids learn the most when they're happy and when the subject they're learning is fun and very interesting and when they're in a good environment. With FACS, it not only detects a humans emotion but it will be able to communicate with a teacher to notify them when a kid is not doing well.           ",0,persuade_corpus,2

"People say that technology is forever chaging, getting better, and more advanced. Some for the good, and some for the bad. Today they are trying to invent cars that drive themselves but still require a driver. However I don't feel like driverless cars are necessary in today's world. There is too much room for error, just like any piece of technology, there's errors, and things can break. Talking about driverless cars means to trust your life with some piece of technology. I want to be confident when I'm drivng, meaning, I'm in full control of what I'm doing. I don't want to have to blame anyone else but my self if I cause an accident.

The first acouple statements of the passage states "" Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore? He envisions a future with a public- transport system where fleets of driverless cars form a public- tansport taxi system."" I can't imagine a time like that because there a millions of people out there who are able to drive perfectly by themselves. I don't think that people want to have to rely on calling a driverless car to come pick them up to take them to work or go to other places. People like to be self sufficient, get up and go whenever they want to. People don't want anything holding them back or preventing them of what they want to do.

The passage also states ""Most laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and law makers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" If they continue to go on with the idea of driverless cars, a lot of events have to go right for them. It's going to take a lot of time, to propose new driving laws and getting the technology where they want it to be. I belive if it's not broke, don't fix it. Also if there were to be an accident in one of these cars, the question of liability could cause a lot of problems and headaches. I question the safety of these cars and how reliable they are. I don't think that many people would trust their life with a car that can drive itself.

Driving is a privlage and a huge stepping stone in life. Driving also comes with alot of responsibility, and educates people on saftey, and help with social interaction. Driverless cars also take the fun out of driving. Most teenager boys and girls can not wait until they turn the legal age and can get behind the wheel and drive. Most teenager vison themselves driving anywhere and everywhere after they get their license. Going to driverless cars makes driving boring and doesn't teach young adults the respnsibility and importance of safety while driving. Paragraph 8 states "" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get boared waiting for their turn to drive?"" It also limits what they learn, like the laws and rules of the roads while driving. Driving is neccessary in most people's lives today, and a lot of people enjoy driving.

Driverless cars sound like they can be very expensive. If Sergey Brin's envision holds true, where are they going to get the money to provide cars for evryone in the world who needs them?

I do not support driverless cars because there is too much room for error, I don't want to rely on a car to pick me up and take me places. Driverless cars limit the learning potential about driving for beginner drivers. Drivng is fine the way it is now, they just need to focus their attention on the cars people drive today.

Although these cars might sound like a good idea now, but could cause a lot of unneccesary chaos in the future. Would you trust your life with a piece of technology that drives you where you desire?   ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Drivers Should Not Be Able to Use Phones While Driving

Approximately 25% of all motor related injuries and fatalities are caused by distracted drivers. Distracted driving includes any activity that requires you to not have your full attention on the road and your surroundings while driving. A big factor in distracted driving is the development of cellphones over the past few decades and the common use of them while driving. Driving while using your cellphone takes your attention and focus off of the road and during the time someone takes their eyes off the road to look at their phone anything could happen. This poses a large threat to themselves, other people that may be riding in the vehicle, and the other people driving on the road. This is why drivers should not be able to use phones while driving.

Distracted Driving been the source of countless motor vehicle related fatalities. According to the Department of Motor Vehicles, at least ""9 people in the U.S. are killed each day as a result of crashes involving a distracted driver."" Using a cellphone while driving coincides with the idea of distracted driving. Many teens and adults feel the need to be on their phones while driving but this poses a large threat to innocent people driving on the road. Distracted driving has been considered by many as an epidemic that is entirely preventable but hasn't yet been prevented. Though many states have passed a law criminalizing distracted driving, it still remains a large problem within the United States in itself.

Texting and driving is among the most fatal types of distracted driving as ""when a driver reads or sends a text message, his or her eyes are off the road for five seconds, meaning that a person driving 55 mph would travel the length of a football field without looking at the road"" (Kitch). During these 5 seconds, there is a high chance of getting into a fatal car or vehicle crash which is a threat to other drivers on the road. People who use their cellphones while driving pose themselves as a risk to anyone in the vehicle with them or anyone driving on the roads around them.

All in all, distracted driving, and specifically cellphone usage while driving, causes a great threat to many people. Further action should be taken in order to prevent more deaths and injuries resulting from it and should be heavily enforced. The threat cellphone usage poses to people should stop people from being able to use their phones while driving.   ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I am against driverless cars. Driverless cars do not seem very safe for a couple reasons. For years, we have been driving cars all on our own, and we have been just fine.

Driverless cars may seem new and exciting and it is, but they can also cause us harm. The driverless cars have tons of technology to it. It can help us break, notify us, drive us ,and it can take over the car. Which seems great but the quote, ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"", is a huge issue. If the technology fails and we are injured, it can be our fault or the cars. No one will really know, and that can cause an issue. The person who is injured could sue the manufacturer, but it could not be done because no one really knows who's fault it was. It will be two times more likely to be in an accident if we had driverless cars, because we could cause our injury and a technology misfunction could cause it too. The technology would take over so much that we would just sit there. Some states even make computer driven cars illegal, and many states limit the use of semi-autonomous cars. They will need every state to make driverless cars legal and limitless in order to have driverless cars. Also, the driverless cars would cost too much money for everyone to have either.

It will be much safer to stick with us driving the cars, and not the driverless cars. Driverless cars can injure us and many others, and we have been doing just fine driving on our own. The driverless cars would cost way too much too. Also, every state will need to make driverless cars legal and limitless, if we developed driverless cars. This is why I disagree on having driverless cars.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Winston Churchill famously said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” This statement emphasizes the important role that failure can have in the pursuit of success. Failure can be viewed as an opportunity to learn and grow, and those that understand this are in a better position to reach their desired outcomes. 

Making mistakes should not be avoided, as this prevents us from fully embracing the learning process. Instead, mistakes should be viewed as chances to learn and discover new ideas and approaches. Enthusiasm and dedication should be shown when taking on these failures, as this provides a chance to think through the situation clearly. 

The importance of trying, making mistakes, and learning cannot be overstated when it comes to achieving success. By learning from our own mistakes on our journey to success, we can save time, effort, and resources. Additionally, learning from the failures of others can give insight and understanding to common mistakes, ensuring that we don’t miss steps or overlook potential issues. 

All in all, it is clear that failure can actually be a positive element in our lives. It allows us to grow and understand ourselves better, as well as providing the opportunity to find better solutions and approaches to the same problems. By not vilifying failure, and instead learning from and embracing it, we open ourselves up to a greater range of possibilities, which is what success is all about.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"I think that driverless cars are a great idea but are not yet a safe one. What happens if soembody gets in a car wreck while being in the driverless car? I'd sure hate to be the manufacturer of that car because I'd be losing a lot of money. Driverless cars arent a bad idea I mean, there can be many pros and cons, but no one is ever 100% sure that their idea is as good as it needs to be before they can sell it to people, especially when a human being would be putting their lives in the responibility of a man made machine.

Driverless cars can be good for many, mainly working people on the road. Say you are a business man/woman and have tons of work to do because your company or business relies on you to make your people look good. Well, theres been a bit of an interfence with your work and didn't have time, but on your way to work you can focus on paper work and anything else that is required and have it done while another co-worker had not completed their paper work on th ewy to work. All because you own a driverless car and can getg more done. But when you think about the cons of riding in a driverless car you get to thinking, ""well what if I'm focusing on business work and my driverless car crashes?"" Who will be responsible? The manufacturer of course, because there was some type of malfunction where the car doesn't respond correctly to the surroundings. Would you put your life in the programming of a driverless car? Yes, they'll save lots of time and money but how much more would the damages cost to trust a driverless car to get you places safely?

In many cases I guess you can say that riding in a driverless car would come in handy. Maybe they arent the best for the roads, but what about using them for tours around the city or maybe creating them to travel only at neighborhood speeds? I'm sure the manufacturers will find a more safe use for driverless cars or possibly a different type of driverlesss automobile. In the beginning, middle, and end I still think in my head that driverless cars are never going to be a legitimate guaranteed safety vehicle. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"What if the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can help students get better grades?

I think the new software that has been developed, can improve the grades/ learning of students.

The Facial Action Coding System has lots of great reasons to why it's valuable for students in a classroom.

I think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

Why, because if the students had the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) the teachers would be able to see if the student's are focusing/paying attention to what it is that they are doing.

The teacher's would be able to tell what's wrong with the student.

The student's emotions would show on the system.

I think it's a good idea, now the teacher's can read student's emotional expressions.

If the student is not getting good grades, the teacher will be able to see what it is that the student is feeling.

When the student's are feeling confused, the teacher will know.

Some student's are shy to raise their hand or even ask for help on what they are confused on or about.

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"".

Reading the students emotional expressions, would be a specific result with the FACS (Facial Action Coding System).

Maybe you could tell hows your friend is feeling by looking at them.

But, the system would tell you their exact emotions.

Being able to see how you feel is a great for teachers.

So yes, I think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valueable.           ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Every once in a while, we all take a minute to look up at the bright sparkling stars. After a while, you begin to notice that one ""star"" in particular is brighter than the rest. That ""star"" is actually Venus. It's so close to Earth that we can actually see it. This intrugues many astronomers and other scientists because it triggers their curiosity. It brings much interest to many people such as the author of this passage. The author of this article suggest that studying Venus is a worth persuit despite the dangers it presents.

Although there are many dangers to studying Venus, there is also a plus side to it. If scientists can build a machine that allows us to get closer to objects on Venus, we could take them back to Earth (paragraph 7). If we could do this, it would help us gain more knowledge on the atmosphere and ground conditions of the planet and help scientists learn how to get humans closer to possibly getting to Venus one day. Human curiosity will likely lure us into many equally intimidating endeavors. For example, in the text it even talks about how far we have come with computers. Knowing this, we should take advantage of our curiosity. imagination, and innovation. This would allow all people to have a better insight of Earth's twin planet, Venus.

In conclusion, scientists have come a long way from the very beginning. Astronomers are inventing marvelous machines that last up to 3 weeks even in horrific weather condition simulators. Astronomers are looking at things in a whole new perspective and will one day make it to Venus. Although it's quite dangerous, the work will be a worthy persuit in the end.   ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear principle,

I agree very much with your new rule in progress. children athletes under a B average need to focus on more on school than their sports, because there is a very small chance that they will be a professional sports player when they get older. Something may happen to them now, like they could damage a part of their body permanently. But if they do good in school and learn some things, then they could still have a chance for a good life because they will have what they learned in this school to carry with them all of their life. Because no matter what situation your in you will always have your knowledge. That kind of stuff sticks with you for life. I'm not saying all of these things just to talk, I'm saying it because i really do care about the future of my fellow students. I mean, one of those football players may have an accident and have to have a leg amputated tomorrow. But he will have more time to study on school and get more knowledge. And you never know he could become our future president and thank you for making that rule because with out it he would have never become president.

"Taking classes from home has become a popular choice for many students who are looking for more flexible options for their learning. On the one hand, students taking classes at home can enjoy the benefits of being able to set their own schedule and being able to work at their own pace. They can access resources more easily, as many online courses provide access to academic materials and other resources. Additionally, online courses have lower tuition and provide an easier learning process. 

However, there are drawbacks to taking courses at home as well. Students may not get the same support they would find in a school setting, such as one-on-one help from the professor or access to tutoring resources. Additionally, online courses require more self-discipline and can be more difficult for students who learn better in a traditional classroom setting. Taking classes from home can also lead to feeling isolated from classmates, which can make it more difficult to engage with the material. 

Overall, there are advantages and drawbacks of taking classes at home versus in school. It is important for students to weigh their options when considering which route to take. That way they can find the learning path that best suits their needs.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Dear Principal,

Community service, it does a lot of good. But, let me ask you this, if your students are required to have to participate in community service, and they are forced to do something they are not willing to do, does it really do as much good as if they chose to do it out of the kindness of their hearts?

Many of your students may already be doing community service, which is a wonderful thing. At the same time, many of your students may not be doing community service. That is their choice. If they would rather play basketball, or video games, or whatever they want to do instead of help out others, it should be their decision. As much as I believe community service is a good thing, you don't know what the students are doing instead of this. For all you know, they could be helping their families out at home, or getting active and playing sports, maybe even studying for their school work, If you take away their free time, you just may be causing negative effects on your students learning.

On the other hand, these young adults may be doing things that are irresponsible and foolish with their free time. They could be making wrong decisions, causing trouble, or they could even be making a mess of the environment. Which is where I see your point, community service is good for a young adult, but, if they wish to go out and have ""fun"", however they may pursue that to be, you should let them. They are your students, and are only your responsibility while they are at school for academic purposes. Let their parents teach them valuable life lessons on their own. Even if it means that these young adults may have to make some wrong decisions to realize which ones are right.

In my opinion, requiring your students to perform community service just does not seem appropriate. They are old enough to decide on what is wrong and what is right. If they make the wrong decision, they will learn a lesson. Many times like this will occur in a person's life. You need to just let them live, because life goes on. They will know what to do.

So hopefully after you have read this letter, you will consider the effects of requiring your students to do something unnecessary, that may or may not help our community. Or letting them decide for themselves, and letting them figure out what they should or should not be doing. Thank you.

"Extracurricular activities are a valuable way for school students to learn beyond the classroom and get more out of their educational experience. Participation in extracurricular activities can help students develop better study habits, allowing them to excel academically. Participating in these activities also helps to build teamwork and leadership skills while fostering an environment of collaboration and sportsmanship. Additionally, participating in extracurricular activities provides an opportunity for creativity and self-expression, while also building social connections and relationships with peers. 

Furthermore, taking part in extracurricular activities can offer students a unique platform to develop interests and hobbies, as well as receive recognition for their achievements. Participating in extracurricular activities can also provide a sense of purpose and direction for students, and increase their sense of self-confidence and self-esteem. Finally, taking part in these activities can help students develop important life skills such as how to manage their time, handle failure, and develop perseverance and resilience. 

In conclusion, school students should strongly consider participating in extracurricular activities as it can offer numerous benefits that will help them achieve both educational and social success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"A new technologic advancement for reading emotional expressions of students would be a nice thing to have. Not all kids learn the same way as others do. When a kid is sitting in class and is struggling there might be something wrong but usually nobody asks to see if they can help.

Every kid has those days where they don't want to be at school and they are not in a very good mood. Teachers will be able to look at them ask whats wrong and then try to make the lesson a little different and easier to understand. When kids are better able to understand they will retain the information a lot easier and it will help them later on when they need to go back and remember what they have been taught.

Having computers that can recognize your facial expressions to help you learn would be a nice thing to have. In the world we live in today, there is technology everywhere you look and everywhere you go. In the school district I am in, every kid has their own MacBook and so we are always using technology for our school work. If the computers we used would be able to help us learn easier by telling our facial expressions then I feel like it would be a nice thing to have to help us learn and to succede in life.

Not just certain schools, but most schools around the world use electronics and computers. When you use the computer and get frustrated it would be nice if it could change the content of what you are doing to help you better understand what you are doing so you can learn it easier. With facial recognition with emotions would make it nice for the user and also make it a better learning tool for everyone to use.

Everyone has sat down at a computer and been frustrated on what they were doing but this could lower the frustration and make things easier for everyone. I do feel like this would be a nice thing to have in schools and that it would help kids and teachers out and that everyone would see a change in learning. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Have you ever asked for advice on a topic? And if you did, how many people did you ask? Most people would probably say only one person, and that's fine; however, seeking multiple opinions would probably help you make a better decision. I believe seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice because it helps give the asker more information on the topic, helps them gain a better perspective, and helps them learn from others' experiences.

To begin, you will gain more knowledge on the topic by asking other people. When speaking to other people for their opinions, they will sometimes give you more info, which will lead to more knowledge on the topic and will help you make a more well, thought out decision. They might also give you some websites to look at, which might give you facts that will help you in the future. Asking for advice on websites like, for example, Quora might be able to give you hundreds of advice in order to make a fantastic choice. You will become better at making better, experienced decisions. These reasons are why asking for multiple pieces of advice from different people can help persuade you into making a spectacular decision.

Next, asking many people for opinions will help you gain a greater perspective. Asking many different people with different philosophies or thoughts previously (before you act) will help give you a better understanding on what you are trying to achieve. It will keep you from making a mistake, since you already have other people's thoughts on what you are, or were, trying to do. By hearing what people are saying, you can also combine their perspectives on the topic and make it your own. Plus, listening to others' perspectives will make you more open minded, and be more welcome to people's advice. This means you can make better choices because you are listening to others. These pieces of evidence are why I believe finding other people's opinions will help you make excellent decisions in life.

Finally, you can learn from others' experiences by asking multiple people for their bias on the topic. Many people will make many mistakes in their lifetime, which most likely means they will probably have a lot of awful stories to tell you. If you ask the right person for advice, chances are that they will tell you about it. By listening to their story, you can try to avoid the horrible mistakes that were made, and make a better decision. In addition to making mistakes, you can also learn about their great successes, which you will try to reach, which will lead to a more favorable outcome. Listening to others' experiences can also help you decide on what you want to do. Depending on what people say, you might want to do something else, contradicting that they have done previously, due to their outcome. This is why I believe asking for many people's opinions will help make you choose a better decision.

In conclusion, asking a lot of people for their bias on a topic can help the asker by giving them more knowledge on what they are asking, give them a bigger view of life, and help them learn from true stories. Asking one person will only give you a little advice. The next time you want advice, don't ask one person- ask multiple! You will benefit from it, and will also be able to make a better choice!",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Driverless cars are in theory is a good idea, but when put to the test with real humans inside of them they are far too dangerours and not practical. With no one driving the car, only relying on senors, there is way too many possiblities to injury wether it is the riders or pedestrians. The smart cars would be too expensive for the average american and just not realistic.

In the article, Driverless Cars Are Coming it states that ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009"" What are the specific conditions? Certainly not in a hard rain or heavy snowfall. In real life situations no one watching the road is a huge risk, anything could happen that a senor could not detect. People should not trust a senor to carry their family to their destination, wether it is ten mintues away or an hour.

Who would be at fault if in an accident a driverless car hit another cart that did have a driver in it? With a driverless car the driver would get bored, doze off or spend time on his/her cell phone. With a distracted driver the likelihood of an accident increases dramaticly. The driver presuming that no accidetns will occur would look away from the road, but when a car B pulls out unexpectidly infront of it whose fault would it be? The manufacturer? The driver in the driverless car? Or the driver in car B?

Puting ones' self or ones' family in that kinda of danger is really testing their luck. Smart cars that can drive themselves would be extremly expensive. Brands like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are already in the hundrend-thousand dollar range. A car like is is not practical to the everyday person.

Those who ride in driverless car are put in more danger than those who ride along with a driver. Driverless cars are likely to cause more accident, especially because the car is not seeing what is going on infront of it. The car will not be able to notice black ice, a heavily trafficed area, road construction or know exactly when to use the brake if an accident were to occur infront of it. These types of cars are way too expensive, not realistic and not as safe as they seem to be.            ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I think that driverless cars would be a bad idea. I say this because people got their license for a reason, so they could drive. It says in the text that it would alert the driver when to take control, what if the person sitting in the drivers seat wasn't paying attention and the car wrecked? Then what would happen? My third reason is it would cost a lot of money to make all of the driverless cars, what if people didn't like them? Then manufacturers wasted all their money and time building them.

I think driverless cars is a bad idea. A lot of people went and got their license so THEY could drive, not to have some car drive. I think people would much rather drive their car themselves because if someone else driving wasn't paying attention they could crash cars in the driverless car. Anything could happen since there isnt anyone to pay attention in the driverless car.

The driverless car idea is bad for another reason because in the text it says the car will alert someone if they need to take control. What if someone doesn't respond to the alert right away? Then they could crash into a person or thing. People would have to pay attention at all times and that just gives me another reason to stick to cars with drivers. When you drive a normal car you have to pay attention all the time so I would just stick with that car.

My last reason on why driverless cars are a bad idea is that what if a lot of people ended up not liking them? Then the manufacturers would have just wasted all of their time and money on the cars. The manufacturers should have a test car before making a bunch, to see how people feel about them.

I think driverless cars are a bad idea because people got their license for a reason, people wouldn't be paying attention at all times, and people could end up not even liking them.       ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"As technology continues to advance, online and video conferencing classes have become increasingly popular among students. While these classes offer convenience and flexibility, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of taking online or watching video conferencing classes, focusing on aspects such as student engagement, convenience, topic understanding, and more.

One of the biggest advantages of online and video conferencing classes is the convenience they offer. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, without having to worry about commuting or finding a place to study. This can be especially beneficial for students who have busy schedules or who live in areas with limited access to educational resources. Additionally, online and video conferencing classes often offer a wider range of courses and programs than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions, making it easier for students to find the classes they need.

Another advantage of online and video conferencing classes is the ability to learn at one's own pace. Students can watch lectures and complete assignments at their own convenience, allowing them to tailor their learning experience to their individual needs. This can be especially beneficial for students who struggle with traditional classroom settings, where they may feel rushed or overwhelmed.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider when it comes to online and video conferencing classes. One of the biggest concerns is student engagement. Without the face-to-face interaction of a traditional classroom, it can be difficult for students to stay motivated and engaged in their learning. Additionally, online and video conferencing classes often require a high level of self-discipline and organization, which can be challenging for some students.

Another potential drawback of online and video conferencing classes is the potential for reduced topic understanding. Without the opportunity to ask questions and receive immediate feedback from instructors and peers, students may struggle to fully grasp complex concepts. Additionally, online and video conferencing classes often rely on technology, which can be unreliable and prone to technical difficulties.

In conclusion, online and video conferencing classes offer both advantages and disadvantages. While they offer convenience and flexibility, they can also be challenging for some students in terms of student engagement and topic understanding. Ultimately, the decision to take an online or video conferencing class should be based on an individual's needs and preferences, as well as their ability to stay motivated and organized.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Have you ever had to ask more than one person for advice? As different stages of your life occur, different questions and decisions come into play. Would you like a cherry on top of that ice cream? What college would you like to attend? Do you want children? While having to make these decisions, different advice coming from different people can help make your final choice by, seeing different view points, learning more information about your topic, and finding an alternative option. Asking more than one person for advice can help make a clear decision.

When making decisions it is normal to think you are correct, but seeing different view points can completely change your perspective. Seeing different view points is one of the most important steps in making a decision. Seeing different view points can lead to learning about other opinions besides yours. Once you have seen the different side of things, your decision should be more clear. Seeing different view points could either change your mind or keep it the same, either way it is always better to see the other side of things.

While having to make a decision, most of the time you do not have enough information about your topic. That is why learning more information from more than one person is very helpful. While others are giving you advice, you can learn more information about your choices, and about your topic. You can also find new information, that you might not have considered before. Although learning new information is a positive factor in asking more than one person, it could also make things more complicated, by not knowing which choice is the best choice. Even though that is a possibility, it is always better to know too much information than not enough.

Answering a question can easily feel like a ""this or that"" scenario, when usually that is not the case. While receiving advice you could also come across an alternative option. When talking to multiple people for advice it is common for people to have different opinions. That being said, in some cases combining or doing both is the best choice. There is almost always another option, and asking more than one person can often lead to that option.

Asking more than one person for advice has many benefits, some and not limited to are, seeing different view points, learning new information, and finding an alternative option. In different scenarios, it could maybe be best to only ask one person. Although, when given the choice between one person or multiple people, asking multiple people can often lead to the better decision.  ",0,persuade_corpus,0

"If you have an issue, speaking to more than one person can help you in many ways. This is because you can get multiple opinions, and a better outcome to your issue or problem. You may not know it, but you also have plenty of people you can go to. Seeking multiple opinions is also good, because you will figure out the good outcomes and the bad outcomes of your situation; or situations similar to yours.

Speaking to more than one person can give you multiple opinions, all of which can be helpful in deciding what to do. One person who had a bad experience might give you what they did, making everything worse. This is especially true when the issue involves people. If you ask one of your friends, and they say yes to something you know is bad subconsciously, you should get another opinion. Once you go to another loved one, their added advice can lead to a better close to your issue.

When you have a conversation with more than one person, you can get multiple opinions, different points of view, and different experiences. You can combine these into a chart, and then decide what to do. You might use a combination of things you were told. Getting multiple points of view on a topic can really help with your final decision. If you ask your mother, and she tells you something positive, but ask a friend, and they say something partially negative, you can put what they did together, and create your own solution. Different experiences is essentially the same as different points of view. Having multiple can help you to create your own solution, or use one that worked for someone else.

Now that you know what you can do, who are you supposed to ask? The answer: anyone you trust. Your mother or father are the best option. This is because you are the most comfortable speaking with them, and they've lived through most of the same situations. Next, is a trusted teacher/adult. These people most likely have experience with your predicament as well. If you have friends that you trust and support you, you can ask them about your issue. They may just be able to help. Regardless of who it is, you need to trust the person.

In closing, getting many opinions on an issue can help you make good decisions, and create better outcomes to your issues. Knowing who you can speak to on these problems is very helpful as well. Having people that you can speak with makes you more confident in your decision making, so you can become an amazing problem solver. Using what other people know, and what you know can be put together to create the best possible solution. Help others when they ask you. You might not be the first person they ask, but at least they trust you enough for assistance.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Have you ever been in a sticky situation, and needed some strong advice? I assume you went and talked to more than one trusted person. If you didn't I'll tell you why you should have. When seeking for advice you should talk to more than one person because, there will be a variety of opinions, you can learn from many individuals' mistakes, and the people giving advice can share many experiences, not just one.

When many people are asked to give advice, there will be a variety of opinions. That means everyone will have a different point of view on the issue or situation. The multiple opinions makes it better for you to receive advice. One individual's standpoint is bias, because they only believe in one thing. On the other hand, many individuals' standpoint isn't bias, the reason being : everyone thinks different.

People are human, they make mistakes and errors, but we wouldn't be able to learn and grow without them. Just learning from your own mistakes is helpful, but imagine learning from multiple people and their mistakes. You might not even realize how learning from the mistakes of people is such a habit. For example if you're walking on the street and see someone trip on a pothole, you obviously are going to know not to trip on the pothole. Another example for instance is if you know someone that made friends with an unkind person, most likely you would stay away from that person. Just think about how you could avoid making a ton of mistakes by listening to others and their accidents.

If you seek advice from a person, they are probably wiser and more experienced. It's common sense why you get advice from someone older, wiser, more experienced, or smarter than you. A five year old most likely couldn't give outstanding advice to a twenty year old. One wise statement of advice could get someone far, but multiple wise statements from many people is much better.

The final verdict is that it is much better to seek advice from many people, compared to only one or just yourself. You will have a variety of options and opinions, you can learn from many individuals' mistakes, and you can get advice from people with different experiences. So next time you're stuck in a sticky situation and you don't know what to do, think about getting advice from multiple people.                  ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"As an eighth-grade student, I have learned about the importance of partnerships in achieving success. Partnerships can be beneficial in both personal and professional settings, as they can provide opportunities for growth, collaboration, and shared resources. In this essay, I will explore the risks and rewards of having a partnership, examine the ways in which schools can help students be successful, and consider the implications of schools having a partnership with a local company.

One of the main benefits of having a partnership is the ability to share resources and expertise. By working with others, individuals and businesses can pool their resources and knowledge, leading to greater success. For example, a local business may have access to resources and technology that a school may not, which can be used to benefit students. Additionally, a school may have access to a network of alumni and community members who can provide mentorship and support to students.

However, partnerships also come with risks. For example, there may be disagreements or conflicts between partners, which can lead to a breakdown in the partnership. Additionally, partners may have different goals and priorities, which can make it difficult to work together effectively. It is important for both parties to have clear communication and a shared understanding of their goals and expectations in order to minimize these risks.

In the context of schools, partnerships can be a valuable tool for helping students succeed. For example, schools can partner with local businesses to provide internships and job opportunities for students. This can help students gain real-world experience and make connections in their field of interest. Additionally, schools can partner with community organizations to provide resources and support to students, such as tutoring and mentorship.

One challenge of working with others is the need for effective communication and collaboration. It is important for partners to be able to clearly articulate their needs and goals, and to work together to find solutions that benefit both parties. Additionally, there may be cultural or language barriers that can make it difficult to work effectively with partners from different backgrounds. It is important for both parties to be open and respectful of each other's perspectives and to be willing to learn from one another.

Overall, partnerships can be a valuable tool for achieving success, both personally and professionally. However, it is important to carefully consider the risks and benefits of partnerships, and to work effectively with partners to minimize these risks and maximize the benefits.

"Attitude is an intangible, yet powerful factor that can influence how one lives their life and ultimately, how successful they become. Research has indicated that having a positive attitude can lead to greater success, increased happiness, and greater acceptance within oneself or a community. This is because those with positive attitudes not only tend to recognize their own potential, but also are better at embracing and seeing opportunities to grow and better themselves. Moreover, personal experiences and life lessons can be a primary factor that can influence one's attitude towards life - enabling them to face challenges, stay positive even when faced with adversity, and constantly strive to be better. 

Positive attitudes can also be infectious, enabling those with an upbeat attitude to be role models for those in their community - encouraging positivity and providing the motivation necessary to help others overcome challenges and find success. The importance of acknowledging and encouraging people with positive attitudes is invaluable to any community, as it encourages an environment of growth and any form of adversity can be faced together. Ultimately, having a positive attitude can help individuals to unlock their full potential and have great success; it is no surprise that attitude plays an essential role in the various forms of personal success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Graduating high school in three years instead of four can be a difficult decision to make for a student and their family. While some may view this decision as simply saving a year of schooling, there are a variety of factors to consider, including workload, cost, and potential future opportunities. 

First, the workload. Graduating high school in three years would likely require students to take more courses in a shorter amount of time. This would make it especially difficult for students who may struggle academically or those who are involved in competitive extracurriculars. Additionally, this could also impede the quality of a student’s academic performance, considering the shorter time to complete each class. 

Second, the cost. Graduating in three years would likely require students to pay extra for the extra classes or accelerated courses. Families may also be burdened by the additional costs, such as textbooks, tuition and transportation fees. 

Finally, the opportunities. It is fair to critique that choosing the three-year option may limit a student’s opportunities in the future. Although this decision has the potential to shave a year off of a high school career, college acceptance is generally dependent on credits completed and the courses taken. In addition, students who do not take the traditional four-year route may find it difficult to stand out among competitors who are more experienced in their fields. 

In conclusion, graduating high school in three years instead of four is a decision that should not be taken lightly. Both of the options have advantages and disadvantages which must be considered before a student makes the right decision that best suits their needs.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"When you need advice on something do you ask multiple people?

When I need advice on something I ask multiple people so I can see their side and see what they did when they were young like me. For example when I asked my mom on advice about going to high school she didn't really give me good advice so I went over to my older brother and told him to give me some advice for high school.

When you ask more than one person you will get different answers. Those other answers could help you with something one day. Like for example my brother was saying that it isn't to hard.

Talking to more than one person could help because your getting different ideas and you could talk to different people and they will have different advice. A lot of people go to more than one person so they could get there advice and how they did it from their side.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

To my understanding, it is a huge debate whether students should be required to perform some sort of community service or not. Not only does community service help the environment, your community, your neighbors, and the earth you live on, but is a great activity many students take part in, and i think that it should be required to all students.

In our world today, community service really make a difference. Our communities depend and prosper from people lending a hand to keep their environments safe. If more students were to perform community service, it would not only effect their living environment but also their learning environment. Our school is filled with many great students who love to help out, and i think community service will allow students to lend a helping hand.

There are many ways to help out in your community. You could help pick up trash in your neighborhood, or you could volunteer at a homeless shelter. You can have fun while helping out your environment. Students could help clean the area around their school, to keep it clean and make it more safe. Students could also volunteer at a local soup kitchen, to help make food for those who really need it. I think requiring students to do community service will not only educate students on how important it is to take care of their environment but it would also teach them to appreciate more of what they have, because seeing families or individuals who are less fortunate really makes you become more grateful for all the things you are supplied with.

Some students may not want to pick up trash or cook for the needy. Maybe some students prefer to work with animals. There could also be local pet hospitals, or animal pounds where you could help out at. Animals, also, need to be taken care of, and if all the animals living in your community are safe and healthy, it makes for a more safe and healthy environment for you to live in.

Community service really is a great way for students to help out and that is why i don't hesitate to say that it would benefit the whole school; the whole world. Whatever type of community service you do, it is still making the world we live in today a safer place for our present and for our futures.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The Importance of Outdoor Activities for Physical and Mental Health

Outdoor activities are an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. They provide numerous benefits for both physical and mental health, and they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. In this essay, we will explore the various outdoor activities that one can do, the benefits of doing them, and the risks and safety concerns associated with some of these activities. We will also examine the different types of parks and the fun and health benefits of playing sports outdoors.

One of the most popular outdoor activities is hiking. Hiking is a great way to get exercise, fresh air, and enjoy nature. It is a low-impact activity that can be done alone or with friends and family. Hiking also provides an opportunity to disconnect from technology and the stresses of daily life. Another popular outdoor activity is camping. Camping allows individuals to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and spend time in nature. It is a great way to bond with friends and family, and it can also be a great way to learn new skills, such as cooking and building a fire.

Playing sports outdoors is another great way to stay active and healthy. Outdoor sports such as soccer, basketball, and tennis provide a great way to get exercise, improve coordination, and develop teamwork skills. These sports can also be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels, making them a great way to stay active and healthy.

However, not all outdoor activities are without risk. Rock climbing, hunting, and skydiving are just a few examples of activities that come with a certain level of danger. It is important to always take necessary precautions when engaging in these activities and to have proper training and equipment. Safety should always be a top priority when participating in any outdoor activity.

Parks are another important aspect of outdoor activities. There are many different types of parks, including national parks, state parks, and local parks. National parks are typically larger and more remote, while state parks are usually located within a state and offer a variety of activities such as hiking, camping, and fishing. Local parks are typically smaller and offer more urban activities such as picnicking and playing sports. Parks provide a great way to enjoy the outdoors and to stay active, and they can also be a great place to learn about nature and history",1,llammistral7binstruct,3

General Motors had created a concept car that could only run on a special test track , but the track was to expensive to be practical. Instead of smarter roads smart cars were made. If people wanted to look at this in a psychological aspect, this would make driving more fun. The car options for this program can be turned off when the driver needs to take over and this can be used as a safety issue.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I clearly agree with you. I do think that in order to participate in sports or other activities the students should have a C grade average because, I think that students should not let anything come across them and learning. Also because this lets us know that we are falling behind in our school work and its also warning us that we are either failing or barley passing.

Students should focus more on their future than on anything else. If they want to live in the streets its fine, but they warned them. They should be more aware of their knowledge and grades than anything. The sport and competitions, it doesn't matter if you loose or win, its just a game to begin with.

On the other hand, students should have the right to play whatever sport they like, but it's their grade and future, not ours. It's better to let them handle their stuff, and then maybe they'll know that something is wrong. Students should learn how to handle things and do things right. It will be affecting their grade, not anybody else's.

So I state my point, students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade C average. This helps students know that what they are doing is wrong and that they are caring too much about the sport or activity that they do.            ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Hey, so for this essay, I'm gonna talk about how important first impressions are and why you should always show your best self at the start. Like, think about it, when you meet someone new, you only get one chance to make a good impression. It's like, the first few seconds of a movie, you gotta hook 'em right away or they're gonna lose interest.

So, first impressions matter because they set the tone for how people perceive you. If you come off as cool and confident, they're more likely to think you're cool and confident too. But if you come off as awkward or boring, well, you get the idea. And once people form an opinion of you, it's hard to change it. Like, imagine if you had a bad first impression with someone and then you tried to make up for it later. It's not gonna be easy, right?

One reason why first impressions are almost impossible to change is because of something called confirmation bias. It's when people tend to believe what they want to believe, even if it's not true. So if someone has a bad first impression of you, they're gonna be more likely to notice all the times you mess up or do something stupid, and less likely to give you the benefit of the doubt. And that's not fair, but it's just how people work.

Another reason is that people tend to base their opinions on the most recent thing they've experienced with you. So if you have a bad day or make a mistake, that's gonna be what they remember about you, even if you've been acting cool and confident the rest of the time. And that's why it's important to always be on your best behavior, because you never know when someone's gonna be paying attention.

Finally, first impressions can be hard to change because people tend to be creatures of habit. Once they've formed an opinion of you, they're gonna stick to it, even if you start acting differently. So, if you're always trying to prove yourself to someone, but they're just not gonna see it, then it's gonna be hard to change their mind.

In conclusion, first impressions are super",1,llama2_chat,4
"Some schools of the United States are looking forward to the day that students will attend classes from home by way of online. Dispite this exciment it can be not beneficial for some students in the way of learning. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it won't be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face.

Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline.

One of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldn't offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. For example, my friend Generic_Name. He is attending one class online from his home. He says that he doesn't have too much time to practice a hobby or do something else because he needs to do a lot of assignments for his online class. Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. Also his class online requires to write a lot, such as essays or read books. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. And it doesn't include the warm-ups and classworks during the class. Requiring this ammount of work schools shouln't offered these classes online because too much work is assigned just for one class. If students want to take other classes they won't have time to do it. Like my friend Generic_Name his life has become very busy since he stated taking this online class offered by his school.

In fact, students become very wird because they have less interaction with people face to face. For instance, my counsin Generic_Name she used to be a girl that really liked to interact with people. One day her school offered her some online classes to take. She said yes. Well in a short period of time her parents starting to notice that she was becoming a very shy and wird person when time was passing and continuing taking clases online. Later, her parents found out that her online clases made her become a wird child because of the less interaction she had with people. Schools should privide students a diferent method to help students to attend their classes becuase online classes keep students from the real world and their interaction with people. Avoiding classes online will reduce the percent of students to become wird and shy and to have a better relationship with people.

In conclusion, many schools of the United States should stop offering students online classes becuase it requires a lot of work for the students. These classes just make students's life busier than what they expected. Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers. The real world need students who like to interact with people not shy students. Students don't see benefits of attending online classes, instead it just make their life difficult in many ways.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Everywhere we go we see everyone's face and facial expressions. They could either be good or bad. But what if you had a computer to tell what emotion they were going through if you did not know?

Prof. Thomas Huang and his partner have created an algorithm to depict what emotion a person is having. This technology is very valuable because we have never seen something like this before, it can even read emotions on a persons face from a painting. It uses all 44 major muscles in your face and depending on what muscles a person is using, they can depict what emotion you are going through. For example the author states in paragraph 3 that, ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrow when you're surprised; your orbicularis ori (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"".

In conclusion, this technology could end up being the next big thing just because of the simple fact that it is very new and could be used later on as part of something bigger. This technology could even end up changing how we think as humans and the way the world works today.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Have you ever received the most boring Summer assignment from a teacher and waited till the last week to do it? Many would answer yes. Summer projects are designed to allow for a child to continue to grow cognitively, while away from a continuous study at school. However, many fail to consider that kids are still on Summer break, resulting in fun activities rather than working on a project due 3 months away. In order for Summer projects to succeed, they should be student-designed to ensure engagement within the project, allow them to grow in a field of interest, and give the students an opportunity to express themselves.

Keeping students engaged in a Summer project is critical to the success of the assignments. A student is more likely to spend more time on a project that they are interest in, rather than completing required tasks that they don't want to do. Enacting student-designed projects allows for them to voice what they are likely to do that will keep them engaged in a learning activity. This allows the students to feel control over their Summer, and how they may want to incorporate learning into a fun growing experience. While they may voice their thoughts, they will also have a better understanding on what exactly to do for their project ahead of time keeping them engaged in whatever they need to accomplish. Providing a platform for students to express their ideas, leads to engagement and a product that succeeds the purpose.

For many students, their engagement in an activity comes from the topic, allowing them to have freedom as to what they create, helps them further their mind. This also allows for fun because they are more engaged based on their topic choice. Many people say that they are prone to doing better on an assignment involving a topic of interest because they care more about the product. Student's who care about a topic will give you a product that means something to them, expressing their creativity and effort that they put into an assignment. Lastly, these projects are designed to cognitively grow and maintain a child's mind over break. Learning about themselves is one of the most important ways of doing that; by allowing them to design their own project and have freedom as to what they want to do, you are allowing an opportunity for them to find out what they are interested in and understand more about themselves.

Finally, Summer is defined in a kid's mind to be a time of enjoyment and relaxation after a dwelling school year. With these Summer projects they should be associated with a similar thought. Student's designing their own project will allow for a creative outlook and give them an opportunity to create a better project than a poster board. Creativity proves to be effective in allowing for more growth than ever about how you may want to present what you learned over a break. Also when allowing a student to express creativity you are creating opportunity for them to incorporate something unique into their assignment which will further their engagement and growth.

In all, Summer projects would be more effective and beneficial to student's if they were designed by student's themselves based on an increase of interest, opportunity to grow in a field of interest, and ability to incorporate a personable and creative outlook. Student's will feel empowered and confident in their assignment by self-designing an opportunity to grow themselves. Overall the result and product will be more detailed and purposeful when engaging a student in something they enjoy while allowing growth in their self as well as their minds. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"enjoyment activities involving biking during the summer. Biking is a fun and popular activity during the warm months, and there are many ways to make it even more enjoyable. In this essay, I will discuss different places where people can go with a bike, what people typically do while biking, and consider the different ways to make the bike riding activity more enjoyable.

One of the most popular places to go biking during the summer is a nearby park. Parks often have bike trails that wind through the woods or along rivers, providing a scenic and peaceful ride. Another great place to go biking is a nearby bike trail. Many cities and towns have bike trails that follow old railroad tracks or other paths, and these trails can be a great way to explore the area.

While biking, people typically enjoy observing the scenery around them. They may take in the sights and sounds of nature, or they may take in the sights and sounds of the city or town they are passing through. Many people also enjoy taking food with them on their bike rides. Whether it's a picnic lunch or a snack, having something to eat while biking can make the experience even more enjoyable.

In addition to observing the scenery and taking food, people also enjoy taking friends and family on bike rides. Riding bikes together can be a great way to spend time with loved ones and enjoy the great outdoors. It can also be a fun and active way to spend time together, as biking can be a great form of exercise.

Overall, biking during the summer can be a fun and enjoyable activity. Whether it's going to a nearby park or bike trail, observing the scenery, taking food, or spending time with loved ones, there are many ways to make bike riding even more enjoyable. So, if you're looking for a fun and active way to spend your summer, consider going for a bike ride!",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Dear Principal

Students should be required to clean the community that reason is because half of the garbage is there's they need to be helping and cleaning up there mess not so others can do it for them plus it is good exercise and u still get to hang out with your friends. So yes i do think that students should be helping out by picking u garbage so ti can help the community and help the planet and make are school a little more better than what it is. By helping the community i think that we can make the environment around the school better such as other places at home.

Cleaning up are litter will help with the problems at home u get to hang with your friends and you get to help the environment, it doesn't take time from anything cause you still get to hang with your friends play games and still have fun with the whole school.

We can help the community in so many ways exercising , cleaning up the garbage doing a lot to help the community now that there has been a oil spill we can help those animals in need give them a brand new life.

The tools we have today will make it better especial now that we have tons of students here and maybe those who help can have extra credit or meet new friends or maybe have new friends that we didn't even know we had in the school that existed because we hang out with the same people we made friends with. So cleaning up the school will not only help the school , but the wildlife, kids who are over weight and do not get out as much as your suppose to , help kids get along and share what they have in common. It will also give are school a better name than what it is and raise more money for schools equipment and uniforms. You might even have you parents come out and watch, just be helping out a little can make a big difference.

The school needs to be cleaned and it needs to be done , You have free time so why don't we just help out a little and make a change in the community just a little will help everyone in need. we can have are sisters are family have a good time.      ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"In life people sometimes talk to multiple people when looking for advice. I believe that for many reasons we generally ask more than one person for advice, one person may be biased, not everyone can give correct advice, and they want someone to give advice that share there believes.

The first reason is that people can be biased. Biased people could be your friend, or a parent, and they don't mean to give really advice that doesn't work, but sometimes they just do. A counselor who isn't in your daily life all the time would be less biased and could be a fabulous second option if the first advice was too biased. It is just a good habit to stay away from biased people when looking for advice because nobody needs advise coming from somebody who may just be confused about what the question was. Or they could also purposely give you bad advice so you have to make sure to check that your advice is not biased so you don't take that advice the wrong way and so something stupid or that's not like you.

Another reason is that not everyone can give correct advice. If you ask someone who fought in world war two about stuff it would probably be the wrong type of advice since they were just in a war and are not in the mindset of our current generation. Someone who is way older than you and fought in a war might not be the choice for advice in these modern days. But a kinder gardener would not be good either, because they are too young and it wouldn't be the right advice because they would be in a younger generation mindset than us. So you sometimes have to talk to multiple people so you don't get advice that doesn't work for you.

The finial reason is that sometimes people need advice from people that share there believes. One example is if a Republican asks a Democratic for advice. Or if someone has a different religion than you and you still ask them for advice. You probably will get some advice that works, but depending on if your topic is more controversial on what you need advice about you can get advice that isn't right for you. So generally you should ask someone who you share believes with. If you just let the person give you advice and you follow that advice you got people might suspect something since it might not be the way you usually act.

In conclusion I believe that people talk to multiple people for advice because, people share different believes, one individual may be biased, and not everyone can give correct advice. During life people generally need advice and when they get advice they usually don't just ask one person for the advice they need.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The reason why I agree because I see a lot of people that do nothing all day. My three topics are kids need to learn more, kids need to be more athletic, and kids need to be more interactive.

I agree because if kids got to do extracurricular activites they can learn about what extracurricular activies does for you. Extracurricular activies helps kids work out and get exersize. Getting exersize is good for kids health. If kids got to work on extracurricular activies they would understaand a little bit more then what they did before.

I do not disagree because if kids got to be more athletic then kids would wanna play some sports like basketball or football. Kids would be able to do athletic things and still learn. Kids need to be more athletic because if kids are not athletic they would not wanna come to school and do the extracurricular activies. Kids come to school to have a social life and not work so if there is an extracurricular activies that give them a chance to be social and be athletic.

I agree because having extracurricular activies would be fun. havind extracurricular activies is going to be fun because everybody is going to be running around having a good time. If kids are having a good time that means that they would not mind if everybody had to do a extracurricular activies. Kids being more interactive is good because there are more willing to the extracurricular activies.

My three topics are kids need to learn more, kids need to be more athletic, and kids need to be more interactive. The reason why I put those down as my topic is because I see people all the time wishing they could have done something with their life. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"My name is Luke Bomberger and I am going to tell you some cool things you get to do and see if you become a Seagoing Cowboy. First you will get to see animals that live in the sea such as dolphins, whales, and maybe a shark. One things that really gets me excited about being a Seagoing Cowboy is when I get to hang out on a boat with animals like horses and cows. I think that you should join because you could see the Statue of Liberty, and you might get to meet some really interesting people. When you have droped off the animals you might get to stay a little while and explore the town or city.

If you join the program you would be helping others when they need it. You could marvel at the Panama Canal on your way somewhere just like I did. On your way back you could play games and have tournaments in games such as softball, baseball, and table tennis where the animals were stored.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you could be more aware of others and their needs. It made me grateful that I gave becoming a Seagoing Cowboy a chance and it changed my life.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Students are children, but when schools force them to stay in schools for an extra curricular activity, when are they allowed to be care-free children? Students are more likely to endure stress if time is taken away from them, especially with it is mandated by the school. Most students already feel pressured with the amount of homework that is needed, so when time is taken for Soccer Club, it isn't fair to them. The overwhelming feeling of having to stay after school without the students consent enforces the limited time they have to be a child. The need to have each student participate in one extracurricular activity will have a negative impact for various reasons such as the carelessness on money habits, increase of excessive behavior, and parental enforcement for schedules.

Moreover, the increase of money will revenue towards after school activities rather than going to the better needs for students. Teachers will be working overtime with no pay, and the money towards supplies for extra curricular activities will be spent in a reckless manner. Rather than spending money on new laptops for all students to use, the money will go towards sports activities. Also the teachers will be teaching an extra class with no say, especially if every student is to stay after school. Many teachers may miss time out on their basic needs for after school activities. For comparison, it is as if someone worked a whole day and never got paid, and missed out time to be with their family. Lastly, the money that goes into extracurricular activities will not go to the pockets of hard-working teachers.

Furthermore, the work of teachers will be obsolete because of the excessive behavior that will be endured when having every student participate in an extracurricular activity. For example, when I was participating in Coding Club, I was ecstatic to be in a new club where I could truly learn. Until a group of students started to mess around, they were playing games on the computers and throwing the computers. As a result, the Coding Club had to be shut down and I was devastated. Not only did they choose not to care about the club, it is that they were showing no remorse towards the teacher and other students. This is bound to happen again, especially when all students must attend a extracurricular activity. Students will choose not to care and it will create a domino affect of misery for both students and teachers.

Continuing, parents will be enforced to have a certain job schedule due to the enforced extra activities which may cause many to be upset with the new rule. The need to have one day of an extra curricular activity will not only be a burden to the students participating, but the parents as well. Parents may not be able to pick up their child at a certain time because of their work schedule. Buses may be put in use because of this, but then will also interfere with the schools budget. This will be in the fault of the school since the rule is mandatory, and this will also force the parent to be at a certain time to pick up their child. If the parent is not able to, this will cause the student to stay at school, waiting for their parent to pick them up. This causes the child to miss out on day-to-day needs, such as homework. Students and parents will have a burden for other activities and needs because of the need of participation in an activity once a week.

Subsequently, one extracurricular activity will have a negative impact due to the reckless spending of money, student's uncontrolled behavior, and interference with parents' job schedules. The money that will go towards extra activities will not go for the students needs. The untamed behavior of students will interfere with the teachers unpaid work when having every student participate in an extracurricular activity. Adding on, parents will have to change job schedules to pick up their child from school on time, which may interfere with the parents job. Education enforced every day on a daily basis on a student, so when they are enforced to stay after school with no say, it is unfair to the student and parent.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Failure is a valuable learning experience, and an essential part of any journey to success. Without failure, young minds are unable to understand resilience and perseverance. Failure is the stepping stone to success, and can act as an encouraging motivator when objectively analyzed. Winston Churchill understood this, famously stating ""What is Success Without Failure?"". He realized that success was not capable without having endured failure. This phrase, resonates with many, often providing that needed hope for those wishing to reach their goals. It is only when we walk this winding path of successes and failures that we can gain the insight needed for achieving accomplishments.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Advice, a word meaning receiving someone's knowledge. At certain times, people ask for the advice of others caused by problems going on in their life. Seeking this knowledge will most likely boost ones' chances of having a more successful outcome. Therefore, it would be tremendously helpful to simply ask one or multiple people for advice. Even if one had not asked for advice, the one handing out their wisdom would have seen the struggle of the receiver. Overall, it would be wise to accept advice from others because of experience, knowing what is best for someone, and giving another point of view.

When someone is sharing his or her advice, they could have already experienced another's current position. For example, if someone is running Track and Field, she might feel like giving up after strenuous practices or an exhausting meet. She will then ask her parents, who also ran Track and Field, what she should do. Her parents will look her in the eyes and say ""Push through."" They will tell her about similar cases in which they had desired to simply give up, but then tell her that giving up won't solve anything, it will just leave one defeated. She will carry that advice with her the rest of her life. This same girl will soon ponder about school. She will be going into high school and will enter the IB program. She will turn to her sister, who went through the same program, and ask about the classes her sister went through. The sister will tell her about how, one class in particular, there is a lot of assignments and gets less interesting the harder the course gets. They both bond as they laugh and joke about the nerves of going into high school. She will remember the smiles of that night as she picks classes a week later, and she is sure she has picked the right classes. The experience of others helps one make the right decisions and lead one away from make a huge mistake.

Advice also holds someone's best interests. Meaning that the giver of wisdom also knows what is best for someone. Parents always have their child's best interest at heart and can help them decide the amount of rigorous courses to take going into high school. When their child says they would like to take all AP courses, the parents can tell them to slow down a bit and first try out those classes, instead of jumping in without knowing what lies below. The student will, perhaps, then only take AP English and AP math and wait to take other courses when they know what they are capable of doing. This advice will help the student not stress themselves out because they tested everything out first then jumped in a little bit deeper. Another circumstance, a child does not want to do their school work and would like to go hangout with friends. A sibling or the parents will know that in order to get exceptional grades, the student must finish their work. They will tell the child that the more one pushes back their work the harder it is to bring oneself to complete the assignments. Then, in the future, the child will work more efficiently. Therefore, advice from others can help someones even if they think it won't.

Asking for the wisdom of others will also give one another point of view. Asking for advice can be for something as simple as picking out an outfit. For example, a mother and a daughter go shopping together to pick out a dress for homecoming. The girl wanted her mother to be there because if she liked a dress and her mother did not, she would want to know why. The girl would also want to know what dress looked best. If she had two favorites and couldn't decide between the two, her mother would offer her advice for which dress to choose. After buying the dress, the girl would feel better about her pick. Although, before homecoming this girl had to get into high school. To get into this high school she had to take an interview. Before the interview, she goes to her mother, who has interviewed people to get into medical school, and asks her what she looks for in a student and what to say and what not to say. Her mother tells her that she hates when people do not look at her even though she is the one asking questions. Also, she finds it a bit odd if one doesn't have any questions for her. The next day, she makes sure to look at the person speaking and ask questions when it is her turn. She leaves the room feeling much better that she took her mothers advice. The new point of view from advice can help solve problems and know what one is to expect.

In conclusion, being offered advice can help one because of another's experience, knowing what is best for someone and giving another point of view. The experience of already passing through someone's current situation, knowing the mistakes one made, and the correct way to handle it. Knowing what is best for someone will help them in the long run, even if they do not think it will at the moment. Giving somebody another point of view can help them settle a decision or view how another person thinks about a object or circumstance. Seeking wisdom from others will help one make a better choice and they will carry the wisdom from the advice for the rest of their lives.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"""Try to work harder in life, that will help you with your problems. Being lazier in life is the key to finding happiness, without it we cannot live on. Life is like an ocean, it comes back to get you time and time again."" These are things called advice, it is something that one gives to another to help them with problems they have. The problem with having advice is, due to the overwhelming population on this planet, people tend to try and focus on one piece of advice and not expand their horizon. As a result, they tend to not have a good life filled with joy but a bitter life that leads them nowhere. That is the reason why having different types of advice will help someone out a lot more than just having one piece of advice. There are three reasons why more advice is better: one person cannot have all the advice in the world, having all that advice will help people form their own opinions, and successful people around the world only became successful through the advice of more than one person.

Firstly, there is not a single person in the world who has all the knowledge of life. They cannot know every single culture, every single belief, every single way to cope with life, every single shortcut, and every single language in the world. In addition, that is not the end of the list there are many more things that make up the knowledge of life, which one person cannot have fully. When people seek for advice, they are looking for a solution to a problem, whether it be life or how to answer a question. In order to find the answer to whatever the problem is, there needs to be more than one person involved to help so that they can offer their opinion of the situation based on their experience in the problem. Finally, throughout all of history there is not a single battle won by just one person. It takes a whole army to win a battle, just like how it takes a lot of advice to form one good choice. Also, kings in the old ages had more than one adviser, so that they can get advice from many people who have more experience in life than they do. Therefore, having different types of advice from different people is much better than having advice from one person who does not know everything.

When one person is asked for advice, the advice is followed and the receiver does everything they can with the advice given. When multiple people are asked for advice, the receiver bases off their own choice or opinion from the advice given to them by other people. In this world, everyone is different because of their experience in life, their appearance, their mindset, etc. There is no way advice from one person will help with the problem of a different person, which results in bad advice. Being able to make your own opinion about something based off of other people's opinions is what life is about. The only reason why people are able to give their own advice was by forming their own opinions from people before them. Throughout life, people will face hardships and challenges different from everyone else, which is another reason why everybody is different. Because of that, it is important that everyone forms their own opinion and not just one given to them by only one person. So, that's why people who ask more than one person are able to succeed in life, whereas people who do the opposite get the opposite in life.

Lastly, successful people around the world were only able to get where they are now because of the people surrounding them and the advice they got. Important people in the world such as Bill Gates, got all types of advice; whether it be good, bad, misleading, or questioning advice they still were able to become successful. That is all due to the fact that they were able to pick out the ones that apply to them and form their own opinions. Elon Musk, the founder of the company Tesla, was not able to make a Tesla when he was just a teenager. He had to ask for advice from people on how to make a name for himself, he had to learn everything about a car and the way it works, he had to ask for advice about what to do with all the money he got when he became successful. As a result, he was able to achieve his dream through the advice of others, and not just one person. Barack Obama, a former president, did not now anything about politics when he was a toddler. So, how did he become the first African American president in all of U.S. history? It was because of all the advice he got from everyone on where to go to study politics, how to become a successful politician, how to make a campaign for presidency, etc. Only then was he able to form his own opinion through the advice of others and decide where to study politics and how to become the president. In the end, the only way a person can become successful is by forming their own opinions through the advice of not one person, but many.

""People in this world are only able to live because of the people surrounding them. Trying to forget your past is the best thing you can do. Changing the past will not help your future."" Because of all this advice, it is hard to find the right one that will help someone. So, what most people do is just ask one person for advice and stick to that when solving their problem. That is exactly what leads to bad advice, because there is not one person in the world who has all the knowledge. For good advice, people need multiple types of advice from different people who have different experiences. Using all that advice, they will be able to form their own opinions and use that for whatever their problem might be. Also, successful people around the world are not able to become who they are based off of just hard work. They had to ask for advice from people with more experience about how to achieve their goals, how to fix an ongoing problem in the world, etc. By doing so, they themselves became successful. So next time there is a problem, remember that having multiple types of advice is better. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"When it comes to participating in extracurricular activities like sports and yearbook work at school, there are a variety of potential explanations as to why some students may choose to opt out. High levels of stress and anxiety, a lack of access to resources, or a feeling that they don't fit in can all lead to students avoiding extracurriculars. 

Being unable to participate in extracurricular activities can have long-term negative effects. These activities often present important opportunities for students to interact with each other and learn important skills like teamwork, cooperation, and communication, all of which can become important tools for long-term success. Without opportunities to learn and practice these skills, students may struggle to function comfortably in both college and the workplace. Additionally, students may miss out on potential college invitations or job offers due to a deficiency in these crucial abilities.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"""The Face''

As we all know in the year of 1976 Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a photo which was belived to be a ""face'' formed in Mar's surface. There has also been arguments over the years if ""the face"" was created by aliens or was it just a natural landform. Here is why I belive it is a natural landform.

In the article ""Umasking the Face on Mars, in paragraph 12 it says what the picture that the picture actually shows that the Martian is equaivalent to a butte or messa which are landforms common around the American West. Some migfht that you can't actually tell what things really are just from a picture because it is only a proportion. Well, in paragraph 11 Garvin says that ,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eqytian -style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.

Some might say that you can tell by the picture thaat Viking 1 spacecraft took because of the type of technology they were using in the 20th century. Well in paragraph 10 they said that they rolled their spacecraft 25 degrees to center in the Face in the feild of veiw. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camer's absolute maximum reslotion. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters, 43 in the 1976 Viking photo. This tells everyone that they did not make their decsion based upon 20th century technology, but they captured thier photo with morden day technology.

In conclusion, I belive that ""The Face"" was a just a natural landform. I belive this because of the eveidence that NASA provided and the fact that they went back to space and took anthor picture with up to date technology.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Ever since their invention, cars have been a very important part of the modern society. Everywhere you look there is someone driving to work, or shopping, or going to a doctor's appointment. These are all advantages to  having a car, but if you look closer you can see how these cars may be doing more harm than help. Air pollution is the problem most people see, however cars also keep people from face to face contact when you pass someone on the road, and you can't overlook the extravagant cost of having a car. These are the points of intrest for many scientists, sociologists, and general people all over the world.

Air pollution, the bane of existance for every health and nature lover, is a massive problem that is getting way out of control. In an article by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she explains that passenger  cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some parts of the United States! If you reduce the amount of cars on the roads, it would lower those numbers drastically. For example, in Paris, they banned certain cars from driving on certain days. The result was astonishing! Street congestion alone went down by seventy percent.

While the pollution goes up, the amount of face to face contact of people goes down. Someone in a car could pass someone else on the highway without knowing that that was someone that they haven't seen in months or even years! Without cars the main way of transportation would be walking and/or biking. When walking and biking you have the ability to talk to people . That person you haven't seen in forever can see you and strike up a conversation. Someone who has had a bad morning can have the opportunity to let out some steam instead of  going to work angry and upset.

Something you absolutely can't avoid about cars is the cost. Between the car's cost itself, the insurance every month, the cost of repairs, and the constantly rising gas prices, many people can barely afford it. Without all of those costs, most people could have more money for their home, groceries, education, and many other things.

You can already see the improvements. In 2012, a study showed that driving by younger people decreased by twenty-three percent between 2001 and 2009. Another study showed that there has been a large drop in the percentage of sixteen to thirty nine year olds  getting a license. These are the steps we need to take, this is the path to a better, healthier planet as well as the people on that planet.               ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"A UFO lands in your front yard. Apart from the screaming, you hear beeps and boops. You turn to the side and see an Alien standing in your doorway. He opens his mouth and a loud alarm sound comes out. You open your eyes and then realize it was all a dream. That's the only reasonable explanation for you seeing a UFO or an alien. To this day scientist have not encountered signs of life on any other planet. So what makes you think aliens could have created the face on Mars?

Two decades and a half ago scientist discovered a face like shape on Mars. It was about two miles long. Scientist claimed it was staring at the cameras, but there was nothing surrounding it. No power tools, or hammers, not even a few sculpting tools. How would aliens create such a thing? With alien-y tools? Magic powers maybe? No, because it was a natural formation. Scientist figured out it was just another Martian mesa, which are frequent around the Cydonia. According to the article the only thing different about this one was that it ""had unusual shawdows make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" Which made people go wild.

When Mars' face started its fifteen minutes of fame it became a beloved ""pop icon."" It was featured in movies, books, and radio talk shows. It ""haunted grocery checkout lines"" for years. That is when people, mostly conspiracy theorists, started thinking ""What if aliens formed it?"" Some scientist even started to believe that it was an alien artificat. So more research was done. Scientist took more pictures, which were ten times sharper than the first ones, and stutdied them. Discovering, the obivious, that it was a natural landform.

There was dissapointment all over the place, not only for the people, but scientist too. It was a mesa, a natural landform. It was even compared to the ""MIddle Butte in the Snaler River Plain of Idaho"". Since then the popularity of the face has gone downhill. Maybe one day it'll resurface on the social media as a funny meme that teens will talk about for two weeks. Tragic.       ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Home school is starting to become more popular thanks to computers. Now with online classes students can take online school instead of coming to a school classroom. But is it the best choice for students be allowed to take school online. Students would benefit form being able to attend classes form home because they can pick their own time when they start, have more choices of classes and can still learn during crises.

Picking what time to start school would be a benefit of why students should be able to attend classes from home. For some students it could be hard to wake up at six in the morning to go to school because, of that some teen fail classes. It could be because, they were working all night to help their family with their money problem. With online school student could now start school at ten in morning and have a job later in the day so that they still get job exertions and help their family. It will also get rid of the problem of not being able to go to the bathroom and being hungry during class. Now they could just get go get a snack or use the bathroom. Some may agree, that Student will juts waste their time doing something else. However, with online school parent would be able to check when their kid log in in and for long and also what they have done.

Having more classes to choose form would benefit students taking classes form home. Student would able to pick form more classes online then in school. For example, a kid want to learn about how to build a car or robot., now they can pick more classes based on what they what to do later in life. Schools can not have every avablie classes because of space, but with online now they could take classes that would help them in the future. Also, most adults do not thing that things they learned school were helpful like for example why do we need to learn about pie in math. It would better if there was more classes to choose form help them out in college. Some may agree, that student would take all the easiest class to finish online fast. However, some student may need to take easier classes. One reason could be that they have a learning disable so it is harder for them to learn. also could that they want to not go to college or just want to go to trade school ,so do not need all the harder classes.

Students would benefit form being able to attend classes form home because they can still learn during crises.

With the Coronavirus out there right now school are scambing to find away or student to still learn while not spreading the virus. The humans who where already learn for home do not have to worry about nothing and it is also harder for them to get the virus. With diseases and viruses school are one of the fastest ways to spread them. will it take is one kid to have the disease to it around spread the whole school and then everyone gets it. With online school it would be harder for kids to get the disease. Some may agree, that there other ways to spread disease too. However, there are other ways to spread them, but schools are the biggest way. With schools gone it would take way longer for disease like the Coranavirus to spread around the world.

With being able to pick our own time when they start, have more choices of classes and can still learn during crises are reason why Students would benefit form being able to attend classes form home. If we do not act now another virus could pop up and stop student form learning. Also with a limited of choices of classes more and more people will just think school is useless. This is why we should just move on to home school.                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"The use of technology in everyday life has become an integral part of our lives. From smartphones to laptops, tablets, and smart TVs, we have access to a wealth of information and entertainment at our fingertips. However, this constant exposure to technology can have negative consequences, including addiction, loss of physical sight, lack of communication skills, and the danger of bad influence.

One of the most significant risks associated with technology is addiction. With the constant availability of social media, video games, and other forms of entertainment, it's easy to become consumed by technology and neglect other aspects of life. This can lead to a lack of sleep, poor nutrition, and social isolation. Parents can limit this risk by setting boundaries on the amount of time their children spend on technology each day and encouraging them to engage in other activities.

Another risk associated with technology is the loss of physical sight. With the rise of smartphones and other handheld devices, many people are spending more time staring at screens than looking at the world around them. This can lead to eye strain, headaches, and other vision problems. Parents can limit this risk by encouraging their children to take breaks from technology and engage in activities that promote good eye health, such as reading or playing sports.

The lack of communication skills is another potential risk associated with technology. With the rise of social media and instant messaging, people are increasingly relying on technology to communicate with others. This can lead to a lack of face-to-face interaction and a decrease in social skills. Parents can limit this risk by encouraging their children to engage in face-to-face communication and to use technology as a tool for communication rather than a replacement for it.

Finally, the danger of bad influence is a potential risk associated with technology. With the abundance of information and entertainment available online, it's easy to become exposed to inappropriate content. This can lead to negative influences on behavior and values. Parents can limit this risk by monitoring their children's online activity and setting boundaries on the types of content they are exposed to.

In conclusion, the use of technology in everyday life can have negative consequences, including addiction, loss of physical sight, lack of communication skills, and the danger of bad influence. However, parents can limit these risks by setting boundaries, encouraging other activities, and monitoring their children's online activity. By doing so,",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"First off, I would like to tell you that we have conducted a series of research to prove that aliens did not make this structure, it was just a naturally formed structure. When we first took the picture with the spaceship, Viking 1, we didn't have the best camera strength that we used to take the last picture. This led all of us to believe that it was a face on Mars, and almost everyone sought to it that is was a sign of life on Mars. Soon we just figured out it was another Martian mesa on Mar's surface, nothing special.

When you look at that first picture we took, I could understand that you would believe that it was made by alien life. After slaving over all of the research we had done to prove it wasn't and released it to the press, you still believe it was aliens? Just to make people more happy with the news, NASA snapped another picture with the Mars Global Surveyor. It showed that it was just another NATURAL land form. There was no alien moniment to show. Though not everyone was satasfied with the results.

When they took that photo, The Faces on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. This is a cloudy time of a year on the Red Planet. So people wanted to have a clearer image since the picture had to be taken through a layer of clouds. Finding the Face on Mars wasn't an easy job, but we found it again and snapped a thrid picture in April of 2001. This certain picture showed that it was just another Mesa.

So in conclusion, would you now still believe that this is an alien made structure. After all the research, would you still think that it was a alien made structure? Looking at the photos clearly show that it has only bumps that project the shadows that made the Face on Mars to look like just that, a face. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The more we use cars the worse it is for our environment. There are advantages of limiting cars use and disadvantages. The advantages will ban the usage of cars in some states like German in the suburb area.

Im going to start off by saying that using cars is harmful for the environment. According to the first resource giving to us ""Passenger cars are resonsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emisiions in Europe ... and upto 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" But people are saying its a good idea to ban cars. Heidrun Walter states that ""When i had a car i was always tense, i'm much happier this way."" So to some people there are advatages of limiting car use.

Well we also need to clear the air of the global city. It states that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city."" But humans are also claiming that its making the streets better. ""cold night and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" and also smooth sidewalks are being built and parks and sport centers have bloom throughout the city. Rush hour restriction have cut traffic dramatically and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. The goal is the promote alernative transportation and reduce smog. The driving has decreased 23 percent from the years 2001-2009. That shows you that America's attachment to cars has decreased. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and decreased afterwards. The number of miles driven per person was about 9 percent below the peak and equals to where the country was in January 1995. Some people are saying its cause Americans couldnt afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyways so they wouldnt need any type of transportation. Michael Sivake states ""What's most intriguing is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before turndown."" Even New York's new bike sharing program and skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities , as do a proliferation of car sharing programs across the nation.

To Conclude there are many advantages of limiting the use of cars.  The environment is doing beter without vehicles and we need to clear up the air of the global city.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"People say not everyone can do what some people can do. A person can be good at something while someone else is terrible at it. I disagree with this decision because you go to school to learn about what you need to know for the future. You don't go to school to learn about sports, or learn how to make yearbooks. You don't go to school to get pushed by someone about something you don't want to do. You should be able to have your own choice.

For instance, I play basketball for my school. I had my own choice of if I wanted to tryout for basketball or not. Not everyone likes playing basketball like me. I like basketball because when im on or off the court it makes me think about the game not about life or whats happening on the bleachers. I try my best at practice so I can maybe start in a game. You got to work hard for something you want.

Another example is when I get older I want to be a cosmataligist. Some people may want to be one also. Others might think the opposite. When I was a kid I use to play with doll's hair and watch YouTube videos on how to die hair, cut hair, and also brush hair the right way.

In both of these examples I was trying to explain that not everyone is the same. You might have the same talent as someone or you may not and thats okay if not. You might want to be the same thing as someone when you get older but someone may want to be the opposite.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The president of the united states is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest countrys on the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College,  the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If its worked for over 200 years why change it. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids run-off elections and should be kept as the form of election of the U.S. president of our state.

To Begin With, the Electoral College has been used for more than 200 years and our state is fighting for another 200 years of electoral college. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he states ""there are...reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.""  Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that ""A dispue over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote."" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidiates share of the Electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Furthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he says ""nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370). There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invaribly produces a clear winner.""

"Obvously the aurthor must be a fan of scientific and that's great because I am to! The aurthor feels as if, there is multiple things you can do in life and thats means if going out your comfort zone to do it then so be it. In the story and as I was reading it, he really wants to find out more about earth and its ""neighbors"", as I should say. Venus and Mars are close to earth, but venus is closer, and the reason I say that is because of size and density. In the text, it says that we as humas, we have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world and the reason being is because we and he also, wanted to find out more about venus and how it works and many diffrent features.

Venus has a thick type of surface to it. It has a thick atmosphere of 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets. In the atmosphere of venus, there is a type of acid called ""Sulfuric Acid"" and this acid is basically the determination of the temperture for this planet. The average temperture for venus is 800 degrees Fahrenhiet, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what it would be on earth by its-self. Venus also has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system even though we have mercury closer to the sun venus is still hotter. The reason people and scientist are so fasinated with venus and how it works is because it was one of the closest to being more like earth and it has some features like it to. This planet has more like valleys, mountains, and craters and as a author he wants to find out about more of the festure and how this will benifit him more in life if he were to continue searching about venus and earth and how they are diffrent and similar to each other.

So in this passage, the author gave me some information about the earth, venus, mars, life, merchury, and etc. The author basically is saying at the end of the passage, that if you were to go out your comfort zone to go explore things like earth and scientific material things, that it would'nt hurt and now that I know I feel as if the author will end up exploring more about venus and that is has some good feature and bad features and the same with earth but in reality it isnt bad.

Dear Principal of SCHOOL_NAME,

You know you have heard what kids have been saying right, about if we should be required to do community service or not? Well I have friends that support both sides of the issue, and they are constantly bickering at one another, and is just want that to stop. So before you read this letter think to yourself, should i make kids do community service ? Well after you read this letter, your decision will most likely be yes, i should make kids do community service.

As I stated up top, i think you should make us do community service, even if we don't want to. One reason why you should make us do community service is so that we know kind of what we want to be when we grow up. By doing community service, it opens up opportunities, and different choices that we never knew we had. So say someone has their mind set on being a professional athlete, but then gets the urge to be a firefighter? Then he can do community service to see if that urge to be a firefighter was a legitimate idea.

Doing community service also builds a person's character. I say this because what if someone was mistreated all of there life, wrong place at the wrong time, you know what I mean. So community service lets those type of people get away from their life, and help other people's, thus resulting in building character, and thus further resulting in a changed person for the rest of their life

In conclusion, I am for making kids do community service. I am for this for a few reasons. My first reason for this is to make kids figure out what path they are going to be headed down in life, and maybe even change that path to a better one. Another reason is that community service builds character, and it can also result in the changing of somebody's whole entire life. So after you read this letter, I hope you can see deep down inside your heart that making kids do community service is only a good thing. And I am sick and tired of hearing my friends argue all the time. So if you are going to make a decision, I think almost everyone at are school would hope that you would make a decision sooner rather than later. So i guess also see you at school Mr. Principal.

"No Cell Phone Use While Driving

While driving down the road in her car, Jirah's cell phone rings, but she tries to not pay attention to the phone. Later, her phone lights up for a text message. She thinks that this could be important, so she checks the message. CRASH! Next thing she knows, she is waking up in a hospital,with her family and friends trying to tell her she was in a car accident. She tells her family and friends what happened for her to crash. She was texting and driving. ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"" (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving). Based on this information, a lot of people have crashed their cars and been hurt or lost their lives to cell phone use while driving. Using cell phones while driving puts the driver and others at risk, and there should be no cell phone use (texting or talking) while driving because it can cause wrecks and even death.

First, texting while driving is dangerous because it distracts the person driving which can cause an accident. When a person is using a cellphone while driving, the focus is on the text message and not on the road. Drivers need to be focused on just driving. Texting is very popular today, especially with people my age, and texting while driving has become really easy to do.

This affects my generation the most because, according to the article on ""Texting and Driving Accidents Statistics-Distracted Driving"", ""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving""; teen brains, like mine, are trained to quickly pick up their phone when they hear a notification (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving). When teens get text messages or calls from their partners or friends, they become more worried about that notification, and it seems that they sometimes forget they are driving. Cellphones can be like the devil.

The person is constantly tempted to use the cellphone at the wrong time and can become attached to it, which causes a lot of danger.

Talking on the cell phone while driving is also dangerous because it distracts the driver, too. Whether it is bluetooth or holding the phone in your hand, this distraction causes car accidents which can cause death of the driver and others. According to the TeenSafe article, ""it takes only 3 seconds after a driver's attention has been diverted from the road for a crash to occur"" (100 Distracted Driving Facts & Statistics for 2018). That being said, no matter how careful one thinks they are being, one moment of being distracted can change a person's life. When driving distracted by your cell phone, you can get into arguments with someone on the phone or can get horrible news that can cause you to lose focus on the road. This loss of focus can easily cause terrible injuries or even deaths. A lot of people have lost their lives because of their decision to talk or text on phones while driving.

To sum it all up, one should not drive and use their cell phone due to how dangerous it is. Driving distracted by a cell phone can cause car accidents with terrible injuries and even death.

Distracted driving is dangerous to everyone, especially teens. According to an article on distracted driving, ""driver distraction is reported to be responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes"" (100 Distracted Driving Facts & Statistics for 2018). Adults and teens put themselves and others at risk when they make the selfish decision to use their phones and drive. As studies continue to show, use of cellphones while driving isn't safe and causes harm and death to many people in our country. We can all do our part and put the cell phone away while driving. The life you save may be your own. Stay safe and make good choices. Do not lose your life over your cell phone.

Vauben created a movement called ""smart planning."" They tried to seperate suburban life from auto use.

Source 1 states, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions."" If people would stop driving their cars or just drive them less, the world would be a healthier smog free evironment. Mr. Goldburg said that ""How much you drive is important as whether you have a hybrid."" Emissions of private cars owned by middle class are chocking cities.

Source 1 states, "" In previous bills, 80 percent of apprpriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transportation."" These things show how limiting car usage will help the world be a better place.

Many people in columbia and cities all around have had bike trails for this movment since the 1990's. Most people in columbia see this movemnet as a good thing and ride their bikes to and from even when its raining. In

Source 4,

"" studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This show how limited driving can help the planet and help those who cut out driving become more involved in sports and the environment.

Source 4 states, ""As of 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" As I said before, people are starting to notice the revolutionary change in the world and are slowly jumping on board.

"The ""Face of Mars"" isn't really a face. It only looks like one. It's because of the land and the shadows it gets, from different angles. It may look more like a face at other angles, and it also maybe just looks like a big blob of land. So it's not a face. Also if anyone was able to create that it'd be impossible because no human being could live there. There's no oxygen there. So it'd be impossible if someone created that, there on the planet Mars.

Yes, when they did first discover the ""Face on Mars"" everyone thought it was a face on Mars, but over the years it became a whole lot easier to see. At first the photo taken in 1976, was a very blurry picture, not high quality on that first one. Then the second one, taken in 1998, it sort of still looked like a face, but not as much as the first photo. Then the last one taken in 2001, you could see and tell that it wasn't a face. It was just the way you would look at it. At different angles. So it is really all your say, not mine.

It only looks like a face because of the shadows and the landform. The huge rock formation has given everyone the illusion of it having eyes, nose and a mouth. When none of that stuff is really there, in the first place It just looks like it's there, but in reality it's not. Nothing is there except for rock formations and a whole bunch of different landforms. There's also one weird and unusual shadow that made the rock formation look something like an Egyptain Pharaoh.

It just all depends on if you still think it looks like a face. It's all your opinion, not mine. Ihave no say in what you think it looks like. We don't see everything in the same way, no one does. So if you think it looks a face still then to you it's a face. But to me it's just some landform that looked a lot like a face when the first photo that was taken in 1976, it looked a lot like a face. But then over the years we took more pictures an dit turns out just to be some landforms and shadows.        ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I think that it would be useful if the computer could know and understand the emotion expressions of the students, but I don't think that it could actually happen. The reason why is because you could text someone and you could be playing around but they could take it as if you are mad or angry at them.

For an example you and I could be texting back and forth and I could tell you something and you could say what ever and I could seriously take that into consideration that you are now mad at me. I peronally do not think that it could ever happen, but if it were ever to happen then yes I think that it could help the students. I personally think that it could possibly even help the students do better in school. If the computer were able to tell emotions and the expressions of the emotions, then I also fell that when a student is writing an essay and the teacher is reading it then they could tell how the student is feeling. Expessially if it is something that is serious and it is about the students childhood and their story is really depressing, then the teacher could understand the student more.

Vauban's streets in germany are completely ""car free."" People who do not drive cars any more and ride bikes, walks or rides the tram are said to be more happier this way. A mother of two walks and rides her bikes every where with her kids and does not feel as tense and stressed as she did when she was driving.

Also a huge advantage is it drastically reduces greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Diesel fuel was banned in France since tax policies favored dieselover gasoline. Delivery companiess complained of lost revenue, but exceptions were made, plug-in-cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers.

In Paris there were days of near record pollution, so they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below average and equal to the country in January 1995. ""The rate of car ownership per household and per person came down two to three years before the downturn."" Michael Sivak stated. New York has a new bike sharing program and the skyrocketing bridges and tunnel tolls reflect people to want to not drive cars anymore.

A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, just shows you that the beneficial implications, environment and easier way of saving money does make people want to start biking, walking, using a tram, etc. Those examples I gave you are a few advantages of limiting car use.         ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I agree that some schools should let students do summer projects sometime over the summer. My main reasons are: staying active, not being lazy, and keeping your brain and yourself on track . During the summer you should want to go out and enjoy the outside world, you can do other things as well and to be creative about things for your school summer project, other than staying indoors and deciding to only sit around and do nothing.

First, the reason I said to stay active is because when you are outside you never know what you will find or discover if you are doing a project, or just simply exploring the world or the envoirment you live in. Discovering new things helps you think about nature and physical activity that is happening all around you. If you are doing a specific project, then maybe you should look for certain things outside, or even think about what would be great to add on to your project. Stay focused and try to look forward into new things that you see for your summer project.

Secondly, for my reason of not being lazy is mostly saying that instead of being at home watching television commercials, or being on your phone all the time, maybe even just sitting and play video games is way worse than enjoying yourself. You could be missing so much fun things that are just waiting for you to explore with outside. It could be new animals you never seen before, something interesting that you might want to experience or hanging with friends. They can even help you on your project to if you want them to join as well. Don't just sit around and put boring things on your project, or words that dont make any since to you or the topic of the project. You want to be creative with your ideas think positive about finding new things and most importantly ,have fun with what you are doing.

Although, you might not be lazy but you must have your brain and yourself on track at all times. School projects are made for you to have fun while doing them, and to meet new people if you are working in groups , or even if you are by yourself and still have positive thoughts for you and your project then everything its going just fine. You must make sure that you feel comfortable to do your school project and to have all the things you need to make your project creative, strong, and well written. Over the summer, you want to go places to enjoy your self and not to sit around and be off tasks all day long.

This section might be a little off topic but I just wanted to say , whatever you do over your summer break is up to you. You can be outside having fun or maybe even inside as well enjoying yourself. Some people would not like to do a creative project outside sometimes but that is okay as well because you can do your project inside too. A lot of times, projects can be for fun or just to be graded when you come back to school. While you are doing your project, it helps you learn more over the summer break and you become interested to do certain things over the break and thats fine to. Being creative is another way of saying, you got this no matter what.

In conclusion, have fun with your project. Don't be afraid to do anything with your project that mainly talks about you or what you like to do in your life. Doing projects makes kids want to do them more over time, and then they might just might, be able to describe many things specifically for their projects. Learning on the other hand, makes you think more than just to not think at all. Just remember, while you are doing these projects once again you must continue to have fun with them. Tell about your life, family, or other and to have a great summer as well.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In my opinion, yes that would be very helpful and valuable to have that type of technology in our classrooms. heres why.

A lot of students hide all of their emotions and hold them inside and that sometimes can make us do crazy irrational things, like shooting up a school full of kids. If we had this technology we could figure out how a student feels and try our best and do whatever we can to help them before it gets to that point. If we had that technology we would be able to get a student into counciling or to a therapist or just to a close friend to talk to because who knows that could save that students life. If we knew what was bothering students or knew that there was something bothering a student we could maybe avoid all of those student v. s. teacher fights that happen because that student isnt in the right mindset and that teacher had no idea.

Another reason why that type of technology would be useful is learning. Say a student was doing some school work on a computer and they start falling asleep because the content is so boring. If we had that type of technology the computer could change the way the content is being presented into a wat that is more interesting and exciting to the student. Every student learns differently and if we had that technology then we all could excel in school.

Not only could we learn better and help the teachers understnad us better we could understand the people around us better. We could learn how to recognize those faces and understand how the person we are talking to is really feeling. Not only that we could make a whole new lie detector test for authorities. If they had those they could truely find out if someone is guilty because as the passage said faces dont lie. Maybe if we had that type of technology helping the law the crime rate would go down emencely because if criminals knew that no matter what they did they would always fail this test if they lied they wouldnt commit those crimes and risk getting caught.

In conclusion, having this technology could help the world beyond our imagination. If we had this, maybe, just maybe our dreams for a better place might start to become true.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"I think that driverless cars are great. you dont have to drive when you are trying to put on makeup or do other things that u dont have time to do when you are in the house. It would make it easier when you have to go somewhere and you do it feel lke driving. There will be self driven cars in the future. It is a big negative on having self driven cars to one messup in the cars system and it can take away lifes. It could be a tragic accident from jus one messup. There is many things that can go wrong but not alot of things that can go right.

Having driverless cars have its pros and its cons in all I think it would be a good thing. If something goes wrong thought the dealership could have alot of legal problems. Then te us will have to change some of the laws if they make driverless cars. I think that druverless cars could be the next big thing if it becomes a sucess. there become a great what if factor if they go through with the driverless cars. What would be the point if you still have to hold the wheel when you have the so called driverless car about bmw.

I think that driverless cars will be and great thing its will help with everyday driving. It can be just as bad as good .

"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:

Imagination is way more important than knowledge. I mean, think about it. When you're reading a book, don't you picture the characters and settings in your mind? That's imagination! And it makes the story way more interesting and fun to read. Like, if you're reading a fantasy book about dragons, you probably imagine what they look like and how they would fly. It's way more fun that way!

And it's not just reading books. When you're studying for a test, you have to use your imagination to picture the concepts in your mind. Like, if you're learning about cells in science, you have to imagine what they look like and how they work together. It helps you remember the information way better!

But here's the thing: knowledge is important too. I mean, you need to know stuff to imagine it. If you don't know what a dragon looks like, you can't really imagine it. So, it's like, imagination and knowledge go together. They're like two peas in a pod or something!

I know this because I've tried it out for myself. Like, when I'm reading a book, I always imagine the characters and settings in my mind. It makes the story way more fun and interesting. And when I'm studying, I try to picture the concepts in my mind too. It helps me remember the information way better!

So, yeah, I think imagination is way more important than knowledge. It's like, the two go together and make learning way more fun and interesting. And who doesn't want to have fun and learn stuff?! 😃",1,llama2_chat,0
"Generic_School is currently having a debate about who should be in charged of designing the summer projects,the answer is simple, the teachers. Teachers should be in charged of designing summer projects because they are more knowable about the class curriculum for the up coming school year. Also, they be in charged of designing summer projects because they are more qualified.

Teachers should design summer projects because they are more knowable about the curriculum for the up coming school year. Most summer projects are based around one class, so the project should directly reflect what is taught in that class. There is no better way to be sure of this then to have the teachers who teach theses classes also be the ones in charged on designing them. For example a chemistry class might want to do a project about punnet squires, but the class that year is based mostly on the Periodic Table. Because of this, teachers should design the projects because they know what the students will need to be prepared for in the up coming year.

Teachers are required to go to collage for a minim of 8 years before they are allowed to practice teaching Because of this, they are more qualified to design summer projects. While in collage for teaching you are taught how to make projects both interactive and educational. For example, a physics teacher could assign a project where you measure how far you can throw a paper airplane and then convert the measurement into various other measurements. This project is both helpful with preparing students for the upcoming class and still being interactive. This physics teacher knew how to balance out this project because it is is one of the things they teach in the collage curriculum, making them more qualified to design projects.

Although some may say that students are more likely to do summer projects if they are the ones who get to design them, this is simply not true. No matter what design is chosen this choice will not make everyone happy. Also there will always be students that just wont do the assignment no matter who chose the design. For example, a few years back I had an assignment in biology about the water cycle, although the teacher let us chose our groups and the projects design there where still students who refused to do the project.

The answer to Generic_School's debate is simple. Teachers should be the ones designing summer projects because they are more knowable about the upcoming class curriculum and they are more qualified. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Man kind has always invisioned a magical future. A future that includes time travel, flying, and driverless cars. The basis for a plethora of T.V. shows and movies has been based on these very ideas. What if one idea of this imagined future was closer than thought possible? Driverless cars are no longer an idea for the future. Driverless cars have become an idea of the present. In paragraph 2, it states that since 2009, Google has had cars developed that can drive themselves under certain conditions. Driverless cars may face some difficulties, but the pros do outway the cons. I believe that driverless cars should be made because they allow safe multitasking for the driver, give safer conditions while driving, and set the bar higher for future technological goals.

The cars deemed as the future allow endless possiblities for productiveness with the driver. The self driving cars let the driver catch up on paperwork, or let them make an important call. The cars could also just be nice for a relaxation time. This wouldn't be considered a safety hazard because manufacturers working on this driverless car are involving notifications for when the driver is needed. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager, states how they would deal with difficulties involving this in paragraph 8. BMW is working on making driving interesting, so that the driver wouldn't just get bored as the car drives itself. Some manufacturers are working on bringing in display boards or some type of information system to make it interesting. But when the driver is needed in tough conditions, the displays are turned off and the driver is notified when needed. Every concern is listed with a solution in paragraph 8.

The car overall becomes safer, rather than just the action of multitasking. With regular cars, the driver has to keep eye for danger themselves. With the driverless car, it is involved that the car informs the driver when they are needed or if a rough situation is ahead. The driver would be notified by some type of sensor. The sensors have been around since as early as the 1980s, as stated by paragraph 5. The sensors in the car can cause brakes to be applied and can reduce power from the engine. The car would have a greater response and greater control than a human driver ever could. Paragraph 5 tells about the sensors and tells about how improvements for sensors are still underway to this day. In paragraph 7, it states that a driver can take control also, and will be needed in tough situations. Drivers can still have a sense of control over their car.

Driverless cars also inspire others to shoot for high goals in the technological field. Every technological advance has been inspired by some other tehcnological discovery. Just recently, a new fad had come along called hover boards. But these hover boards weren't the ones seen in the Back to the Future franchise, these hoverboards were inspired by them, but didn't exactly hover. Still, the creators of this type of hover board were inspired from a different technological idea. Great strides in technology or ideas for technology make us want to move further. In paragraph 6, Sebastian Thrun, the founder of the Google car project, stated, ""There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there, and the mapping wasn't there. Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack."" His basic idea, was that as time went on and technology got intensely better, so did the technological ideas. These self driving cars could inspire even more magnificent ideas for the future.

In conclusion, these cars not only let the driver mutlitask safely, they just in general make driving safer. These cars could inspire the greatest invention in history. Technology is based off of other technology. The pros for self driving cars outway the cons for a plethora of reasons. Driverless cars are closer than one thinks, and are safer than one thinks. In paragraph 10, it states that Tesla has a release date for 2016 for the driverless car and Nissan plans to have cars that are driverless by 2020. Driverless cars are the now and they are worth it.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear principle,

I understand that you want to raise the standard for playing sports and other activities so that each student involved needs to maintain a B average to participate. I think this is a good idea because it will motivate students to keep their grades up, and still get to do the activities they want. As I am not involved in sports, I'm not sure my opinion will be most valid. However, I do know that, for a fact, some students will not like this new rule.

They may say they feel more pressured, and some parents might even get into the argument, both on the pro and con side.

On the contrary, I personally think it's a good idea to get up, and keep up, students grades. Some will be upset about it, but will thank you later for making sure that they keep up their GPA while still letting them do extra activities.

One obstacle you may or may not have to face when making this decision is the parents of students. Because you don't have every student's background knowledge, you wont know how the families of these students will react. For example, there might be parents of students who want their child to focus on sports, and sports only. That might be kind of hard to do when they are staying up until midnight to complete assignments to maintain their B average. Several families will get upset at this.

However, A school meeting could be held with the parents and families who both agree and disagree. I think it's a good idea to start this rule that will apply to most, but I think some exceptions can be made for other select students in other personal situations.

That doesn't mean that for those select few, they can goof off and still participate in sports and activities, it just means that for some of them, maintaining the traditional C average may be best.

"Despite the dangers of exploring Venus , there are many valid reasons to enocourage us to continue to investigate our sister planet. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explains why the pursuit to learn more about Venus is worth it. In the article the author explains the conditions that make Venus so dangerous to us, and the motive for NASA to continute exploration.

Venus is the sister planet to Earth. This is becuase Venus is the closest planet to Earths density, size, and ocassionally the closest in distance depending on the orbit. Since the planets are so similar you'd think the conditions would be as well. In the article the author describes the conditions as, "" far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" The other then goes on to explain that the thick atmosphere of Venus is almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide. To make things more understandable he also adds the challenge of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the planets atmosphere. Not only this, but the temperatures average is over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth. As you can see the conditions of Venus are very extreme based off of the information in the text. These conditions make it very hard to study Venus due to the fact that it's conditions are too extreme for us to get close enough too.

Now that the readers have been given a description of the conditions on Venus, and faced with the challenge of it's exploration it is time to ask why try to explore Earth's ""twin"" planet. According to the author, "" Astronomers are facinated by Venus becuase it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet inn our solar system."" After the author says this he then explains that a long time ago Venus was most likely covered largely with oceans, and could have supported various forms of life. Although today the planet still has some physical features similar to Earth such as valleys, mountains, rocks, and craters. Thus making Venus NASA's nearest option for a planetary visit. Although the conditions are to harsh for us to travel too.

The motive for exploring Venus is very encouraging. The only thing holdong astronomers is the condition, and complications with the deails of proximity. On the up side the author talks about how NASA has a idea for sending humans to study the planet. The author says, "" NASA's possiblesolution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" Basically the author is saying that NASA plans to send a blimp-like vechicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. The author further explains this by comparing this solution to what jet airplanes do to avoid storms,which is travel at a higher altitude. By doing this we can have a clear understanding to what astronomers are doing to solve the issue of proximity , and accesibility. With this solution the exploration of Venus, and it's many rewards can hopefully be reached.

In the article,""The challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author did a very good job at explaining the situation, and presenting the readers with facts, and evidence. The author supported his claims with knolege about the planet, and motives of NASA. Not only this, but gave a solution to the issue. The author did a good job of supporting the idea that the pursuit to explore Venus is worth the risks.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Have you ever wondered about Venus? This planet is somthing that we as humans haven't figured out yet. We are facing the challenge of Venus, it is really valued not only because of the facts and information we get out of this planet. Instead, humans are curiose and looking for more evidence of what we are going to face in the futur. We should learn more not only on the outter shell, but more deeply in the inside.

Venus is the second planet in the our solar system(Milkyway). Also ot is one of the brightest points in the sky at night. As the closest plant to Earth in terms of size, density, and distane. The surface of it is full with valleys, mountains, and craters. Not even one single spacecraft have reached to it before. 97 percent of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, forming a blanket for the planet. This planet has the highest temperature in the whole entire Milkyway. NASA(National Aeronautics and Space Administration) have not stop sending spacecraft to land on Venus.

If we could lend on Venus later on in the generation, could there be any living organisum that lives on that plante? There could be a possible chance since Earth is not the only planet in space. There are more things tha we need to discover. You would never know if there are creatures like ous that have a abiliy to explore space. We should keep trying even if there is only a 0.0000001 chance.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Senator

In the year 2000 there was a presidental election. The two canadate runnning were Bush and Gore. In that election there was a problem, Gore had won the votes of the people but Bush had won the votes of the the Electoral votes. Now the question is asked who should win, should the person who had the most votes from the people win or the person who had the most votes from the Electoral College win? This is something that has been going on for a long time, does the Electoral College over rule the people? This is an importain question that we the people should be asking, do we realy pick the persendent or does the Electoral College pick it and we are just there for show? The Electoral College is an out dated sistem that we keep because the goverment wants there to be a clear winner, but we know that is not what the people the people want the right to dicide.

The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers and made as a ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifies citizens."" The Electoral College vote on the President and the Vice President. It has 538 members and for there to be a winner a canadate, has to get a majority of 270 electoral votes. Your states allotment of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional degation. The problem here is that there is 300 million people in this contery and only 538 people get to vote on who is going to be president.

Also most states have a Winner takes all system were the winner of the majority gets all of the votes. For example florida has 29 electoral votes so if one canadate get 15 which is the magority he will get all 29. Because of this there is not an acurate repisentaion of what the state thinks.

The last reason it is not a good system is because the people's votes do not matter. In the 2000 election Gore had won the peoples votes and Bush had on the Eletoral votes. now Bush became president even tho Gore had won with the people. The biggest problem with the Electoral College is the fact that it over rules the people. If the Eletoral College wins it does not matter how many people vote for the other person running it will not matter. Now the question is acked, What is the point of voting if it does not matter who we vote for only the Electoral College votes matter?®                    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" The author stated both positive and negative stances on the topic of driverless cars. This topic is very controversial when bringing in the aspect of safety and the well-being of others around the driverless car. And, because of that I believe driverless cars are not a good idea to bring into society.

First, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because drivers could get reckless at the wheel. In the text it stated that ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" meaning that at some point the driver would have to help the car navigate at times when the car couldn't(7). Which imposes that the drivers would have to be aware of his/her surroundings at all time when the time was needed for them to take the wheel again. But, doesn't that defeat the purpose of the car being driverless. No one would want a driverless car that still needs to be driven? ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive""(8). And the most important question is, what would drivers do to pass the time when they're not driving. They could distract theirselves with their phones, music or any passengers which could cause them to miss out on any important message from the car telling them to drive or take over in the needed situation. This is where the reckless aspect of the driverless car comes in. Missing the important message could cause accidents and harm to other drivers or pedestrians. And, this cause of harm to others around leads to my next argument against driverless cars and that is lawsuits.

Second, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of who would be to blame if accidents did happen. In the text it explained how new laws would have to be created to go along with the cars when they are proved to be ""more reliably safe""(9). But what would happen ""If the technology fails and someone is injured""(9). This issue could cause many lawsuits filed against innocent ""drivers"" and many lawsuits filed against companies who were not aware of the issue with the cars technology. Sometimes things happen and because technology can not be trusted 100% of the time these cars should not be able to exist. Lives could be on the line and many people who were not to blame will take the blame for this mishap. The car could just cause a million more problems instead of solving the laziness of humans will not to want to drive.

Lastly, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of its proness to being hacked. Anything in the world could be hacked. Anyones phone can be hacked, computers can be hacked and even intelligence units can be hacked. So, if these things can be hacked then what makes one think that this driverless car can't be hacked. And, if hacked there would be no telling what the hacker could do to the car. For example, cause it to crash or lead the car into an area the driver in unfamiliar with because they're not paying attention. These examples could all cause harm to more than just the driver and that shows why this car should not be implemented into society, because it has various accounts on how it can misfunction.

These examples of recklessness, misblaming and hacking all show why the idea of having driverless cars are not a good idea. They can mess up society and cause harm in more ways than it could help society. Although the car is a very unique way of showing advancement in the technological world, one would have tot look at both sides before concluding whether or not this is a good idea, and in this case it seems that the bad outweighs the good.

"Keep Your Eyes on the road 1 out of every 4 traffic crashes that occur in the United States are caused by cell phone usage. Each day 11 teens die from a result of texting and driving. Even AAA reveals that 94% of teens acknowledge that they know the dangers of texting and driving and 35% admit to doing it anyway. Should we be able to use our cell phones while operating a vehicle?

How can we drive for others when we won't drive from ourselves?

Teens between the ages 16 to 19 are more likely to be involved in a fatal car accident than any other age group. I think teens in that age group are afraid of missing out or (FOMO) basically the desire to stay connected with what others are doing at all times. A subconscious habit that causes drivers to feel the need to know what other people are doing constantly. Texting while being behind the wheel takes the drivers eyes off the road for 4.6 seconds which is the same amount of time it would take to travel the length of a football field.

We shouldn't be able to use cell phones while driving to protect us and others around us. It is many temptations when we are driving but we got to remember that we drive for others not ourselves. More than 1000 drivers are injured every day due to distracted drivers and we got to limit the distractions for drivers.

Texting while driving is illegal.

As of July 1st of 2018 Georgia Governor Nathan Deal passed a law prohibiting the use of a handheld phone while driving. The Hand free law first conviction is a fair $50 fine and 1 point assigned to their driver's license. Second conviction fine is a $100 and 2 points added to driver's license. You can receive jail time if you are a continuous offender. I do believe that the consequences of violating this law is fair and should be complied by.

In order to reduce preventable accidents, we have to be more cautious as drivers for others around us. That mean taking our eyes of the phones, and keeping our eyes on the road.             ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Community service is an essential part of any society. It is a way for individuals to contribute to their community and make a positive impact on the world around them. As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that community service is important and should be a requirement for all students.

Community service allows individuals to give back to their community and make a difference in the lives of others. It also helps to develop important life skills such as leadership, teamwork, and communication. By participating in community service, students can learn to work together towards a common goal and develop a sense of responsibility and empathy for their fellow community members.

As for how a principal can decide who should do community service, I believe that it should be based on a combination of factors such as academic performance, behavior, and participation in school activities. For example, a principal could require all students with a GPA below a certain threshold to complete a certain number of hours of community service before being allowed to participate in extracurricular activities.

In addition to academic performance, behavior is also an important factor to consider. Students who consistently behave in a disruptive or disrespectful manner towards their peers and teachers should be required to complete community service hours as a way to learn responsibility and improve their behavior.

Lastly, participation in school activities can also be taken into consideration. Students who actively participate in school events and clubs should be given the opportunity to complete community service hours as a way to give back to their community and develop important leadership skills.

In conclusion, community service is an essential part of any society and should be a requirement for all students. As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that community service helps to develop important life skills and allows individuals to make a positive impact on their community. Principals should decide who should do community service based on a combination of factors such as academic performance, behavior, and participation in school activities. By requiring community service, principals can help to create a more responsible and empathetic society.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Having a positive attitude in life plays an important role in one's personal and professional success. Studies have found that positive attitudes can increase self-esteem, create more meaningful relationships, lead to better health and help build resilience in the face of life's struggles. There are many examples of successful people who have demonstrated the power of a positive attitude to shape their lives. For instance, Steve Jobs was famously known to have a strong optimistic outlook, which is often argued to be one of the key contributors to his success. 

At the same time, many argue that there is no single key to success and it is more important to focus on skills and hard work than attitude or outlook. There are countless unreliable biographies, for example, of famous people claiming to have an unattainable positive outlook that was responsible for their success.

Ultimately, having a positive attitude is important for success in life, but it is not the only factor. It can help in certain ways - like fostering a healthy self-esteem and helping build healthy and supportive relationships - but it cannot entirely replace hard work and preparation. Success is the result of the combination of all of these elements.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, so I'm applying to this really cool company and I wanted to do some research on it before I send in my application. I found out that it's a super cool place to work and I think it would be awesome to work there. Here's why:

First of all, the company is really good at making sure their employees are happy and healthy. They have all these awesome benefits like free food, gym memberships, and even meditation classes! I know that when I'm happy and healthy, I do better in school and I'm more motivated to learn. Plus, who doesn't love free food?! 🍔🥤🥗

But that's not all, folks! The company also cares about the environment and they're always finding new ways to reduce their impact on the planet. They use recycled materials, turn off lights when they're not needed, and even have a recycling program for their employees to use. I think it's super important to take care of the Earth and this company is definitely doing its part. Plus, it's just cool to work for a company that's doing something good for the planet. 🌎

Oh, and did I mention they have a really cool culture? They have all these fun events and activities that employees can participate in, like game nights, potlucks, and even volunteer days! I love meeting new people and making friends, and this company seems like a really fun place to do that. Plus, it's always good to give back to the community, right? 😊

So yeah, I think this company is pretty awesome and I would love to work there. It fits with my personal goals and ambitions because I want to be happy, healthy, and make a positive impact on the world. Plus, it would be super cool to work for a company that's all about sustainability and having fun! 🎉

Anyway, that's my essay. I hope you like it! 😊",1,llama2_chat,0
"I've never had to complete a summer project before, but I know some schools do. The students may not be too thrilled about it, but these projects help them be more engaged and continue learning while they are on summer break. There are different ways that school can help make these projects at least a little bit more bearable for the students, like letting them design it themselves. Some people may believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed, but projects that are designed by the students themselves gives them more creative freedom, makes the project more enjoyable, and teaches students new things even when they aren't at school.

Student-designed projects give students the creative freedom that they need to help them get through it much easier. Whenever given very specific instructions with little to no room for creativity and individuality, it makes it very difficult for me to get through the project. I know that most students love to put their personality into their work, and when that option is stripped from them it becomes a lot less interesting to complete. When teachers let kids express themselves through their work, more often than not, the results that come out of it are much better than if they weren't.

Letting the students help decided the requirements and aspects of the project makes it much more enjoyable than if the teacher were to just give instructions and everyone has to just do one thing. I hate doing projects most of the time because I'm always just given a topic and requirements and am let go to just do whatever work the teacher gave me. I've always found it much easier to do projects when we are allowed to choose what we do them about things that we truly enjoy learning about.

It's no surprise that students probably don't want to be spending their summer break doing homework, but giving them a project can actually be quite beneficial to them academically. By assigning a summer project, students have the opportunity to continue learning even when school is out. When teachers let the students decide for themselves exactly what the project should include, they are going to have a lot more fun with it; in fact, it may actually help them complete the project and impact their studies even farther. When given the opportunity to research something that they are truly interested in and passionate about, the outcome quality would be truly wonderful.

Some people feel that summer projects are more effective when created by teachers because it gives students a similar academic basis for what they should be working on; however, student-based projects are a better choice because it gives more creative freedom to the students, the project itself becomes more enjoyable, and helps students continue learning even when out of school. Kids love being able to do things they are passionate about, and letting them help with assigning their own projects gives them the opportunity for greatness.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I dont agree with the principals decision. For my reason is this. One, we don't have to go if we want to.

Two, we can make our own decisions and not for an adult to make decisions for us. For an example, if a person does something without your permission they're making decisions for you. Although, If that person comes up to you and asks "" hey there is a really cool sale going on hoodies and they want to ship the first hoodie for free."" "" I just want to know if you're okay if I tell them your address."" If you say no you are making a decision not to tell them your address. Same thing goes for school. If an adult starts to tell you something that you do not want to do. Then don't do it and don't listen to them but if it's beneficial to what you have to do by all means do it.

Since our principal made the ""decision""

that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity he or she is basically but not really forcing us to stay after school and do other things than our homework or projects. Since our principal decided we have to do after school activities, there are some kids that play sports outside of school. For an example, if I had to stay after school and do an activity I might miss my football meet this Friday/Saturday. If I don't show up I might miss my chance of showing to the coaches what i'm capable of.

For that incident I might not be able to join an outside football team. There might be some times where you have to listen and do what the person is telling you to do.

Since the principal made the decision to make stay after school to do an extracurricular activity, we might as well do it even though i'm not very fond of people making decisions for me. I can do a few thing until I completely lose interest in a certain subject.. Since it's only one thing we have to do how hard can it be but my answer still stands on me disagreeing with the principal on staying after school and doing an extracurricular activity. There might be some kids thinking "" oh well I need to stay after school so I can get my grades raised"" the only club that might get your grades raised is the homework club and that club is for people that have a lot of homework on their hands. Since that is not considered an extracurricular activity by the principle you might as well stay after school and go to that club either way.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Hey there!  So, I've been tasked with writing an essay on whether graduating high school one year early is a good idea.  As an 8th grader, I'm not exactly sure what to expect, but I'm gonna give it my best shot! 🤞

First off, let's talk about the advantages of graduating early.  One of the biggest pros is that you can attend college earlier! 🎉 Like, imagine being able to skip that whole awkward freshman year and jump right into college life. You could get a head start on your studies, make new friends, and maybe even get a jump on your career goals. Plus, you'll save money on tuition and living expenses!  If you do the math, you could save like, a bunch of cash! 💰

Another benefit is that you'll have an extra year to figure out what you want to do after high school.  I know, I know, it's hard to choose what to do with your life at such a young age, but hey, at least you'll have more time to think about it! 🤷‍♀️ And if you change your mind a million times, no big deal!  It's all part of the journey, right? 😅

Now, let's talk about the success rates of students who graduated early from high school.  Apparently, they're pretty darn good!  Like, did you know that early graduates are more likely to get into college and have higher GPAs? 🎓 They're also more likely to get into their top choice school!  Talk about a confidence booster! 😍

But,  there are also some potential downsides to graduating early.  For one, you might miss out on some important social experiences.  I mean, high school is supposed to be fun, right? 🤷‍♀️ And if you skip out on",1,llama2_chat,4
"To be in a Seagoing Cowboys program would be awesome to be apart of. Being apart of this program you could see cool things,see different cultures,and just think about what an opportunity this could be. You could have so much fun being apart of this journey.

I think being apart of this program would be a awesome opportunity because not alot of people could do this and be apart of a program. You also get to see really cool things like antique artifacts,really old buildings,and diffrent lifestyles. This would be so much fun because you can learn how other people live their lifes in different countries,and explore places you never thought you would even go to. You could also see different cultures and try their kind of food they eat every day,and see how people in different countries go about their everyday lifes.

I think this could be a life changing oppotunity for people. This is a awesome thing to do because it is not an everyday thing for most people to be apart of.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that online classes have numerous benefits for students who have difficulty coming to school and those who work. One of the most significant advantages of online classes is that they allow students to take their courses in the evening, which can be especially beneficial for those who work during the day. This means that students can balance their education with their work and other responsibilities, making it easier for them to achieve their goals.

Another benefit of online classes is that they offer flexibility and convenience. Students can complete their coursework at their own pace, which means that they can take as much time as they need to fully understand the material. Additionally, online classes often offer a variety of course options, which can make it easier for students to find the courses they need to pursue their interests or career goals.

Some people argue that online classes are a waste of time because they do not offer the same level of interaction and engagement as traditional classes. However, I disagree. While it is true that online classes may not offer the same level of face-to-face interaction as traditional classes, they can still provide students with valuable opportunities to learn and grow. For example, online classes often include discussion forums and other interactive elements that can help students engage with their peers and instructors.

In conclusion, I believe that online classes offer numerous benefits for students who have difficulty coming to school and those who work. They allow students to take their courses in the evening, offer flexibility and convenience, and provide valuable opportunities for learning and growth. While some people may argue that online classes are a waste of time, I believe that they can be a valuable tool for students who are looking to achieve their goals. I encourage all students to take advantage of this opportunity if available.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Imagine it, sitting at home in your pajamas getting ready to take a test for high school, and it sounds to good to be true. Many schools do offer programs like this so they can open up space in classes for other students. These programs have shown improvement in student mental health as well as scores. Students who take classes at home would benefit students because it would improve overall grades in certain classes, help students with more family responsibility get an education, and students don't need to worry about the stress of the classroom.

Certain classes don't require as much guidance from the teacher as others, and that is just the reality of it. Classes such as math and sciences require students just to know how to work a problem, and that can be taught with a book or a video. So with more of the more technical classes being at home grades will improve because of the more time dedicated to learning a concept at home instead of a more limited time in the classroom. Also if you do have a question for the course at home technology today allows us to instantly communicate an issue to our teachers. Overall students in this environment can gain a lot out of working out problems at home.

Some students have missed school some days or even dropout because of responsibilities at home. Online classes provides them means to be able to get an education and better improve their lives. This allows opportunities for higher education or even a shot at a job. Online classes give the time needed for students that have more responsibilities to learn key concepts in classes. These students have the work ethic to be great students,but lack the time to work on school. However because of online classes they can work and excel at it.

The stress and anxiety of the classroom creates an setting that makes students not get the help required to learn the material, but with digital courses the more stressed students can learn the concepts. Students put pressure on other students to move along with a lesson especially when no other students are confused; this leaves some students behind in courses. Also for the few students that do fall behind are affect the whole year due to missing one key concept at the beginning of the year. This can be solved with online classrooms because it is a much more one on one learning experience, and allows students to grasp the main ideas. Students who suffer from stress and anxiety can have an equal opportunities as the more confident students.

In conclusion,students overall who have difficulty due to time, mental health,and just plain boredom can have an equal shot at an education as other students. Online classes are the path to success for students that have to take care of younger siblings or work to support their families. Also they give students who don't need to much help in a class to have more flexibility in a class. Finally students who suffer from anxiety are given a chance to really learn a concept,and not fall behind their piers. The idea of an online classroom will be the future of the education system in not only Virginia, but The whole United States.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"There are numerous amounts of risks and rewards that come with the study of Venus, and it is difficult to know whether the good outweighs the bad. The author attemtps to support the study of Venus by including facts and the possiblilty of scientific discoveries. I believe, however, that the author failed to be pursuasive in his support on the subject, due to his lack of supporting evidence and his stating lf the many risks of studying Venus.

The authors most critical mistake in the article was the use of too many facts that caused more concern for risks, and not enough rewards that would come with the study of Venus. He states the conditions of Venus, temperature, atmospheric pressure, its carbon dioxide plagued atmosphere, along with many other negative qualities of the planet. The article even states the failed spaceship landings on the planer. To the reader, stating these facts is credible, but too many of these negative qualities fail to entise the reader into thinking that the study of the planet is a good thing.

The author also fails to persuade the reader when dicussing the positive impacts that this study could entail. Too many of the topics the author writes about are hypotheticals and provide, at times, little factual evidence. These hypotheticals and the small proportion of facts used are also mixed together with risks amd negative outlooks as well. Very little is said to make one think that the study of Venus is vital or logical.

The author used little positive facts about the study of Venus, and talked of too many risks of this pursuit. He did not effectively pursuade me to believe that studying Venus is a worthy aspiration; rather, his facts and evidemce ,ade the exploration seem illogical. In order to support this cause to the bedt of his ability, the author must use more facts instead of mainly hypothetical situations, and use less negative facts about the study.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Online Class Are Highly Beneficial to Our Society's Students

Just imagine if you could take a class that would support you greatly in your future pursuits. Truthfully, we already have them; they are online classes. For example, my school district, Generic_School, has Virtual Generic_School. In these classes, students are able to fulfill credits or take classes that help students gain knowledge on a certain topic. Unfortunately, there is a debate about students having the option of attending class online, but based on my experience, online classes are highly beneficial towards the students because they aid the personal pursuits of the student and teach students a higher level of independence.

Firstly, attending classes online from home aids in the personal pursuits of the student. For example, some of my classmates that are Seniors will take the Physics Honors class on Virtual Generic_School, so they are able to take a job during their Early Release block(students are able to leave early to pursue other interests.) When Seniors are able to take a job, they are able to gain funds to attend the college of their choice. This is greatly helpful because in college tuition is rising, and many former college students say, ""they lack the funds to pay for college tuition."" Due to this, an online class provides time for the student to pay for their college tuition in a proper manner. Additionally, I took a Virtual Generic_School Course on Personal Finance and Economics, so I could get an Early Release for my Senior Year. Thankfully, I was successful in this class; this provided my a free extra period in which I will use to volunteer at the Generic_City Hospice, so I can gain medical experience and aid the community in a positive manner. As you can see, attending online classes from home greatly enhance the possibility that a student can pursue their personal pursuits aiding them in a great positive manner.

Furthermore, online classes are supporting a student to learn a higher aspect of independence. For example, the student is not being forced towards waking up and coming to class. In this case, the student must have the desire to continue the class. This demonstrates the ideal of drive, and employers want to see that you have the initiative to complete tasks because this proves that the employee truly cares about the success of the company and has a great sense of drive. Also, my online class on Personal Finance and Economic taught me a great level of time management. During this time, I had a family trip and many guitar events coinciding with my online class. Due to this, I had to manage my time at an extremely high level which supported me to finish the class before the due date. As a matter of fact, this learning of time management made me understand the value of time and how to use it in a more efficient manner. This aided me greatly in sophomore year because the classes that I took were of higher rigor, but I was still able to increase my GPA and pursue my personal interests because of the level of time management that I had learned. Time management is greatly needed in independent life because without time management, there would be chaos in life, we would never be able to manage work and personal life causing a great deal of stress within us. In conclusion, these examples show that online classes provide the student with a learned sense of independence.

Many supporters of not implementing an online class, say, ""online classes are going to cause students to forget about the old, classic way of teaching."" While this may be true, we are in a society that is changing rapidly, and we need to benefit ourselves in the greatest possibility. Even if that means that we must switch our teaching styles. In the technology era, we are required to use the computer and understand its functions at a great level; the online classes are some of the best providers of understanding technology at a higher level. This could provide our students to be more capable in the workforce, so they can gain more opportunities and a higher level of success among their peers.

In conclusion, online classes are highly beneficial towards students because they aid students to strive for their personal pursuits, garner a higher level of independence, and keep us on track in a very rapid changing society. These classes are highly beneficial, and the success created by online classes highly outweigh any negatives that may be caused by online classes. Now, we should stop imagining us having online class and begin to implement these classes because without our implementation, this could cause a great deal of failure within our society.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principal,

I would very greatly consider policy #1. Students should be allowed to use their cell phones in school. If there is an emergency at home and no one can come to the school to get the student, someone could call their cell phone. It would also be better because students could talk to their friends from different classrooms if they didn't have a hall pass.

If students could use their phones they could go home with friends if they didn't have a ride home. The student could text their parents and tell them to call the school for permission to ride home with a friend. The student could also text or call their friend to ask if they could go home with them.

The only bad part in policy #1 is that phones should be turned of during class time. Phones should be on during class so the student could use it during an emergency. Even some of the teachers have their phones turned on during class. If the teachers can have their phones on then the students should have their phones on too.

There are many reasons for phones being allowed in school and these are some of those reasons.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The author of this passage seems to support the idea of traveling to Venus but also seems to have his doubts at the same time. In paragraph 4 he says ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even dicussing further visits to its surface"" That statement from the passage doesn't seem like it would come from someone who supports the idea.

The other reason I personally believe he doesnt really support this is because when you read passages of people supporting ideas, they dont really go into the negative things that could happen. The author of this went well into detil of the hazards and dangers that can occur on venus. In paragraph 5 he says "" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" He is saying that even after NASA figures out a way to make it to Venus, it would still be extremely difficult but you probably won't die.

My conclusion of this passage is that the author does not fully support the topic he is writing about and for many reasons. Yes, Venus may have had a good enviroment that could have sustained human life in the past but it doesn't anymore. I think we should stop trying to explore somewhere that could harm you.

"The Electoral College is point less. If the govenment wanted us to vote on the president then why have a college that does that for us? The Electoral College needs to be abolished, so that the peolpe of the U.S.A can vote on the president for real. People want a derect vote not just to sit and watched the peoson that they voted for not get elected becuase of a College that has all the ""power"".

It makes no sence that we vote for people that vote for us. If I wanted to do it like that i would move to Canada. insted of letting people having the right to vote they get to watch someone vote for them. In the early Amrican history we needed it but now we do not. You see now we have TVs and smart phones. We are feed information every second of our lives. The news is on every street corner. People in the Electoral cCollege sometimes go rouge and vote for the other party. Back in the 1960's Kennedy almost was not elected because of one state that state Louisiana.

You could argue that it takes time out of the election or that it helps Amricans. Our country prides it self on one thing freedom. Then we dont have the right to vote derectly on the peorson we want. So how in the world does that help us? People make up lies and stats all the tiime to get where they want but the never do good. Let me put it this way would you like someone taking care of your faimly whale your away driving your car, kissing your wife making the dissions then when you get back you act like it does not happen? No you would probable freak out yeah. You spend years makeing these system and trying to let the people be what they want but systums like these do not help on any level.

People in every state vote. Somemore than others. They vote for there party most of the time but when you have people that make big name dission fot the people it takes the power a way from us.

"The way of seeing how kids feel in a class room, this new technolgy shows it all. Will this change teaching and everything else in the class room, lets find out.

Professor, Thomas Huang of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the Universty of Illinois, working in collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe of the Universty of Amsterdam. Are construction a computer with a 3-D computer model of the face; it uses all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, this is called an ""action unit"".

I support this idea and here is why I do. This will show very high improvement in class rooms, as this it will show how a kid can learn, if they are happy about this subject and if they are highly entertained, or this could go another way of teaching say we didn't have this type technolgy. A math teacher gives there students a test, the average over all is a 72%, that is not good, a teacher will have to go over the subject again majority due to failing of the subject. Was it the teacher, or was it the students, who will ever know, but if they had the technogly in the room to read their facial expressions, for that the teacher may have post poned the test due to the results of the facial expressions coming back, which could have showed alot of confusion over the section. That could have saved alot of time and get better grades, as they could of not gone back over the section. This would show a lot of improvement in testing scores over all, as teacher would not mine going back over a answer if a student or students or confused what is going.

There are 6 different basic emotions in the system, happiness, suprise,anger,digust,fear and sadness. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

In fact, we humans preform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. We can tell when a friend is happy, or upset, due to how much we around them. Its that this 3-D facial computer system can even tell more when you can't.

If we had this in a class room , this would help so much, schools could see higher test scores and better improvements. I think it would even better if they took this to even more places. Such as Jails, Conceling areas, Thearpists, as it could show in their true emotions, this could be a lie dector, shows the emotions. Say they can't get anything from someone in a jail, they use that, they could see a fear emotion, or a blank emotion, or sad emotion. I just say this could change the future of alot things in every day life. This could also mean that, school corportaions might recieve rewards for really high scores in testing, which could really help out and some schools, for instance my school, we have don't have some of the newest technolgy as some other schools due, and why because i go to a small school, so we don't recieve high standards as other schools around us do. So that is why i agree we should have this newest technolgy and alot of the schools, to suceed in life and to help kids get better.            ",0,persuade_corpus,3

Hey, guys!  Today, I'm gonna talk about why participating in a school play is super fun!  I know, I know, it might seem like a lot of work, but trust me, it's worth it! 

First of all, making new friends is a total perk!  When you're in a play, you get to work with other kids who are also in the play.  It's like, this whole new group of people to hang out with and stuff!  And, like, you get to know them really well because you're all working together towards this one goal.  It's like, this big ol' team effort, and it's so cool! 

But, like, the best part is performing in front of an audience!  It's so much fun to see all your hard work come together and have people clap for you!  It's like, this big ol' rush of adrenaline, and it's, like, totally worth it!  Plus, you get to show off your talents and stuff!  Like, I'm not the best singer or anything, but I get to be in the play and show everyone what I can do! 

And, like, it's not just about the performing either!  You get to learn so much about, like, stage crew stuff and lighting and sound and stuff!  It's like, this whole new world opens up to you, and it's, like, so cool!

"Cars driving cars? I never thought that the day would come when cars are driving themselves, yet it is right around the corner. Which leads me to be scared do to malfuntions of machines causing injury, But still very excited because of the techonology is very fascinating. Their are so many cars with people driving that get in accidents due to impairment and i believe that this technology can really benefit our society.

Their are many things that a car with no driver can lead people to think. Like it may lead people to think that maybe sitting in a car and not driving may get boring. Although if they are a passenger in a car are they bored?

As Dr. Werner Huber added ""We have to interpert the driving fun in a new way."" In addition to that some maufactures are bringing in-car entertainmet and to me that sounds pretty cool. In contrast to that people may think that this might become a safety hazard. The maunfactures think this can be safer do to the progress in the heads up display system which some cars may have and this can allow people to send a text message and keep their eyes on the road watching for when they may need to take over in driving. Finally this leads me to question why the goverment in some states are blocking this technology? To that i can answer with maybe the fear of change. They shouldnt be afraid of that though cause the world is constantly changing and most times change is healthy.

Their are so many cars with people driving that get in accidents due to impairment and i believe that this technology can really benefit our society.

"I am absolutely for the new tchnology called Facial Action Coding System. Because this technology can be valuable in more than one way. According to the passage this technology can detect when a student is growing bored and can make the subject more interesting. If that was available for students then learning subjects would be come more memorable, because usually when a student becomes bored he or she tends to ""drift of into space"" and not learn anything that is being taught.

If you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, then a similar ad would follow and if you frown then the next ad would be different. That technology could make shopping a lot more effecient, more buying what you do like and less of what you do not like. People around the world would be able to get alot more things done and could possibly become smarter. The technology would break down subjects and materials to help you understand things better like an actual human would.

"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" focuses on the complex software that can analyze a face and even read emotions. The author claims this could be very useful in teaching, for being able to acount for the student's emotions could very well help the computer adapt and change the lesson more efficiently. While this could be true, there are a lot of questions that should be asked before this technology can be implemented, such as it's effectiveness and privacy.

The sixth paragraph says how the computer can know if you're happy or sad, and gives an example ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad may follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This seems to be very helpful, but what if said person was smiling about something else? what if the person remembers something funny that happened the other day and suddenly they notice they keep getting uninteresting ads that pop up? There would be no way for the computer to tell if it was really the ad that made the person smile. Another issue is how it is used in class. Paragraph six states ""A classroom computer could recognize if a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" How would the computer tell what degree a pupil is confused? If a student looks a little confused, the computer may read this and respond as if the student was very confused, thus wasting the student's time with more help than they need. One more way to look at it is the privacy violations the software may bring. What if a student is opposed to a teacher being able to technologically and truthfully read the students emotions? does the computer take a log of the faces of the students? There is too many suspicious questions in regard to the morality and safety of the use of such software.

The software definitely shows promise. It seems to show how far we have come to understanding the relation to facial expressions and emotion. That being said, there is still too much to account for before this new technology can be integrated into classrooms, such as efficiency and morality.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

I have heard from rumor in the school that you are thinking of requiring at least a B average so kids can Join sports and Activities. Well I think you shouldn't do it, I know kids aren't paying attention in class but atleast they have something to work hard for. Now if you do take away the privilege of Joining clubs with an B average then what will these kids look forward to when coming to school? Now think about it while i tell why shouldn't make clubs and Activities for B average and Higher students.

As we go into our school you out of all people will notice that clubs partake in our school. Now what kind of a school do you think this will be if there weren't any clubs or activities. What will the students look forward to? I know I would certainly be mad especially since Most of the students here have a C average. From hearing this well most of the kids would probably boycott and rebel against this, to be honest Sir I would too I would also be infuriated knowing that i can't do the thing that i love so much just because i have a grade lower than what i need to be in order to be in a club.

Besides Sir don't you think we students try to do good in classes just to stay in our clubs it is because we love where we are now in our clubs. I certainly don't know what i would do without doing the thing that i love which is band. Ever since i came to school band has been such a big deal for me since almost all our electives have been taken away, now all we have are just Art, Band and Spanish this is what worries me the most we either loose our electives to the county or to you sir.

I strongly recommend you read my letter and really take your time in thinking about this, I not saying to do for me sir but for the students here that want to a safe and better place to learn as this school says. Trust me sir as i say that i would anything for band i grew being a musician and i love please sir i only wish you can atleast read and think what if",0,persuade_corpus,1
"We were up is space circling Mars snapping pictures and trying to find a landing spot for our sister ship Viking 2. Then we had noctice that in one of he pictures there was likeness of a human face. The head of the face was two miles from end to end. So we decide to send the picture back to NASA to see what they had to say about it. There replies where so shocking to us we could not belive it they that the face had been created by aliens.

Our first reponse to them was that it was simply not possible because aliens do not exist. Even if they did we did not think that it was going to be possible for them to do something like this.

Our second reason we do not think it was aliens was because they would not have the brians to do this. They would not be able to calculate the right measurments and angles also. Plus we dont think they would be able to survive on Mars because of the conditions that are there. These aliens would just have to be out right smart to do something like this. This is just one of those things that seem impossible for an alien to do.

The third and final reason is the point we are trying to get across to you guys and that is that we think is just a natural land form that formed while the planet was being created. If we are being logical here we know that the pyrimads were created by humans them selves but do really think an alien could have done this? We do not think so because they are just not as smart and and not as equpit as a human is. We think that it was a land form God decided to give the planet.

To wrap up everything about this mysterious face maybe it was created by aliens but we may never know because this face is on a planet where a human would not be able to live and survive to witness the aliens build it. The only people that might have got a chance to witness it is atrounauts that would have been up in space at the time. We personally think that it is safe to say that God decided to give mars this mysterious land form and not aliens. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"In the artilce ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

the writer presents the idea that though exploration of venus is dangerous it will be worthwhile in the long run. In the intro of the article the writer opens up by saying Venus is sometimes called the ""evening star"". The writer explains that the nickname given to venus came about because Venus is very easily spotted from Earth even though venus is a planet and not a star. The writer then goes on to say "" While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"".

Paragraph two and three expains venus is similar to earth but also how Venus is dangerous. Paragraph two opens up how Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" because of Venus is closest to earth in terms of density and size. The writer then explains how Earth, Venus, and Mars are planetary neighbors and how all three planets orbit the sun at different speeds and how sometimes how Mars will sometimes be closer to Earth and how sometimes Venus is closer to Earth. The writer then goes on to talk about how humans have sent multiple unmanned spacecrafts to venus but none have reached the surface of the planet due to the various factors that make Venus a ""challenging planet for humans to study"". Paragraph 3 explains the dangerous aspects of Venus. The writer opens up with how a ""thick atmosphere of almost nintey seven percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". The writer then goes on to talk about how average tempatures on Venus are over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit and how the atmosperic pressure is nintey times greater than Earth and that these conditions are far more extreme than Earth's conditions.

Opening up paragraph four the writer asks "" if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists evn discussing further visits to its surface?"". The writer explains that astronomers are interested by Venus because it may have once been ""the most Earth like planet in our solar system"" saying that Venus may have been once covered largely with oceans and could have supported many different forms of life. The writer then says that even now Venus still has vast surfaces of rockey sediment and includes familiar features similar to earth. The writer then makes a statement saying that "" The value of returning to Venus seems indisutable"". Paragraph 5 opens up with how nasa been discussing sending humans to Venus. The writer then goes on to talk about how in order for this idea to work nasa would have to make a special spacecraft that would have to be thirty miles above the surface of Venus. The writer then goes into specifics of how maintaining life on the spacecraft would work.

Paragraph six continues with how the spacecraft would operate. The writer then talks about how scientists would not be able to collect samples from the surface of Venus and how scientists are working on ""innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". Paragraph seven mainly talks about nasa and their other approches to studying Venus. The writer eplains that nasa did a experiment where electrons made of silicon carbide were tested in a chamber simulating the ""chaos of Venus's surface"". The particles only lasted three weeks. It is then explained how nasa was looking to use old technology called 'mechanical computers"". The writer eplains that these computers used gears and levers and no electronics at all. The writer then goes on to talk about how this computer would do better resistance wise in Venus's environment.

Finally in paragraph eight the writer talks about how

""striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value"" meaning that though it will be difficult to explore Venus it will be worth it because humanity will have more research on our sister planet along with that ""our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". This means that we should not let dangerous situations limit human exporation and evolution.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Hey, guys! So, I know we're all supposed to be learning about this really cool topic called ""The Power of Failure"" in English class, but to be real, I'm not really sure how to write about it. Like, I get it, failure is important and stuff, but it's not exactly the most exciting thing to talk about. But, I guess I'll give it a shot.

So, here's what I found out: failure can actually lead to success in a bunch of ways. Like, did you know that some of the most successful people in history failed a lot before they got to where they are today? Like, Thomas Edison, the guy who invented the light bulb, failed over a thousand times before he finally got it right. And J.K. Rowling, the author of Harry Potter, was rejected by like 12 publishers before one finally agreed to publish her book.

It's kind of crazy, right? Like, if these people had given up after their first failure, we wouldn't have some of the most iconic inventions and books of all time. And it's not just them, either. Like, even us average joes can learn from their experiences.

For example, I used to be really bad at playing the guitar. Like, I could barely strum two chords together without sounding like a cat getting its tail caught in a blender. But, I didn't give up. I kept practicing, even though it was super frustrating and my fingers hurt all the time. And now, I'm not great or anything, but I can play some pretty cool songs.

And, I know some people might say that failure is bad or something, but I think it's actually pretty cool. Like, it's a sign that you're trying new things and taking risks, which is basically the definition of growth. And, it's not like failure is the end of the world or anything. Like, even if you fail at something, you can always try again and learn from your mistakes.

So, yeah, I guess that's my essay. I hope you guys found it somewhat informative and maybe even a little bit inspiring. Failure might not be the most fun thing to talk about, but",1,llama2_chat,3
"Many people or specially teenager around the world does not have the opportunity to go to the school because some of them need to work to pay their bills and what they need. This is a great idea for all of those teenager because they can be able to attend classes from their home and learn after work,but the mos important thing is that they should get education. In my opinion is too bad for those teenager who have the opportunity to have their parents which means that they pay all their bills and what they need. For those teenager is bad idea because they have all the time to go to the school and learn faster than those who did not have the opportunity.

First, for those teenager who live in the United State is very difficult to attend the school because some of them came here to work. However, they have the age to be and attend the school but they were to force to work because most of them support their family in their country. In my opinion this offer that some schools are giving is an amazing idea because now they can learn from home by online or video conferencing. The school is very important for the human becuase nowaday if you have more education your value is higher but if you don't have education in this country your value is very low. Therefore, these people need to make good use of these big opportunity because if they achieve to get education they will get a better job,too.

Next, life is very weird sometimes because the people who is attending the school they does not want to go to the school and all of those who doesn't have the opportunity they want to attend the school. I had have the opportunity to meet guys than they have everything what they want but they do not like the school because they prefer to go to another place to smoke,drink alcohool or something like that. they are getting bad habit. Furthermore, they are leaving the time to pass and wasting it and then, for those guys is reallybad idea because they have all the time to learn faster than others.

Finally, the eduacation is very important for everybody because with education you can get a better job and also to get a better future. In my case, I really struggling with school because I work and attend the school so, I know that it is very hard to do both things at the same time but at the end I know that I will be a successful man and that's why I never give up I just have my head up and I trusth in God that he is giving me strenght to keep working hard and I will get my diploma. After that first God I will keep working for my future.

In conclusion, all the opportunity that come from us is fine because the opportunities just come one time. This opportunity that some schools are given to the students is really good because when they get sick and they can not go to the school they can do it from their house and do not loss classes and be able to be really with the classes. As before I say the education is very important to achive goals in life. For those guys who does not have the opportunity to attend school

I just could say that they need to strunggle very hard. In life nothing is impossible if god close doors is because he is going to open another one much better. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"It feels like everytime the education system takes a step forward, it also takes three steps back. Schools offer distance classes so that students can attend class at home, or at a long way from their school district. Though some may say otherwise, easy distractions of the youth, an easy and simpler way to skip class, and/or people not having any access to any computers are reasons why students shouldn't benefit from distance classes.

The first reason why distance classes are not a well thought idea is that younger students of schools would be easily distracted by the Internet's influence. due to their age, students would not entirely learn on their personal device when they are underdeveloped; instead, they wouldn't pay attention due to adds, pop-ups, or any spams appearing. If we give students of schools personal devices, then instead of being educated by the course, they would be distracted by the source of inappropriate entertainment of the internet. Some may argue that if we can notify the student that a lecture is starting so they can be ready for their lesson or test. However, the problem is whether or not they would pay attention in class, not whether or not they can be present on class or not, not if thats any help anyway due to the second reason why.

The second reason is that the students would easily skip the lessons from distance learning. Though not all, students of schools always attempt to not to go to class, whether they fake sickness, tell lies about family members, or just not showing up to school at all. If these student are allowed to do distance classes, they would have the advantage to skip class by simply sending the email stating that they are sick and that their ""parents"" told them that they should not be allowed to be on the computer until they would feel better. Some may argue that they could email to confirm the message from the parent. However, if the student in question's device is their parents device, then they would easily impersonate as their said parent or guardian to trick the teacher,or even the county to believe that they are sick, or they could simply not log in to their classes, nor do any online homework.

The third and final reason why is that what if certain students did not have the resources to partake in any distant classes. Either not having the money to obtain any device for the class, or not having the amount of time to use their families computer, particular students might not be able to do their classwork on time due to those circumstances. These people are not to be ignored by the educational system; these individuals need help because of the poor conditions they live in. Some may argue that the schools can lend them their own laptops to help them out with their classwork and insert ability to the online classes. However there will be a big problem concerning the budget to replace the laptop if the device is broken, or handled roughly, then it the problem would go back to square one, except with the added weight of replacing broken school property.

There is the importance of understanding the mind of a student, young and easily distracted, immature and wanting a way out, or even, those who can't afford or have the time to do so. These problems were a major issue in the past, then computers were just starting to explode on to the scene, when computers were only used in universities and government owned laboratories. If the problem with distant classes dosen't get resolved, then these problems would continue with more advanced preograms and technology. This problem needs to either improved, or resolved within these circumstances.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The Electoral College should be kept. It has been like this for a lot of years so why change it now? It is not a complicated system that people don't understand and works well with our country. Electoral College should stay, many would argue it is not a democratic modern sense but this country is a democracy so of course the system of which we pick our president has to be democratic.

The Electoral College should stay because to win it a candiate would have to be popular in states other than the South. It is understading citizens in the South might feel like their vote does not count, but at the end of the day if that was the way it has been done for several years and there is no reason to change it now. ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign"" (Source 3, Paragraph 20). If people are starting to pay more attention to the campaign and what is happening around the country then that is a good thing to keep the Electoral College. People start to care about who governs and who tries to make this country better. They all go out and vote for who they think it is best, even if the person that they wanted to win, didnt. This system makes citizens feel like their voices matter and it can make a difference.

""The Electoral College avoids the problem of the elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the cast"" (Source 3, Paragraph 22). The Electoral College is avoiding another problem so it should be kept. It is avoiding a problem such as a person getting too many votes and keeps it fair for both candiates. It is important to keep it because voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election (Sourse 3, Paragraph 23). The people that think their political ideas are more imporant than votes, should the person to govern a country. They think about the good things and if their ideas are good enough, they should win.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept the same. It has been the same for years so no reason to change it now. It has more benefits such as, citizens paying more attention to the electoral campaigns, and good candiates who cares more about thier political belifes then votes.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Considering changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average is not a good idea. Changing the rule is not a good plan because most of the students have a C grade average.

A C is not a bad grade, C is considered average. I no most principles want there school to be the best but not everyone can be great. To meet the grade point average of a B is hard because most colleges grade point average is a C.I know colleges are a lot harder then middle school but are brains aren't as developed as the college students. Changing the average is not fair to us because we haven prepared to have to get a B if you want to do sports or other activities. If this was given to us in sixth grade we might have been able to do it but not on such short notice. It puts too much pressure on us students if we have to get a B average if we want to do out of school activities. If we don't get a B but a C are parents might get mad at us for no reason. A C is not the best of grades but it is not bad. If we have a C plus average in college you can play sports. Some people might have counter arguments like a C is not a good grade and if you study hard enough you can have a b average. But its middle school, if it was high school it would be okay. What if you have all B' s but one D? You would not be able to participate in any after school activities. All I am asking is to think before you change the rule.

"Dear Senator,

The electoral college is a big, serious, huge problem. It's super complicated, I mean, we vote for someone, and someone else gets to vote for the person we originally voted. What sense does that make? What's so wrong with a direct campaign? There are 538 electors. There's space for an even vote. Then we'd have to thrown the decision over to the house of representatives. Then what? Those old fashioned group of people get to decide our future? Please. They're living in the 70's! I don't find it fair to the people.

This election is suppose to be ""voted by the people, for the people"" not ""voted by the people, for the electoral college to decide, and then for there to have a possibility of a tie so they have to let the house of representatives decide"" it's ridiculous! Doesn't the sound of ""an election for the people, and only the people to decide"" sound so much better? If the electoral college wants to vote so bad, then they can go to their local polls themselves and vote like everyone else. Since we have a winner-take-all system in each state candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, they solely focus on swing states.

In 2000, 17 states never saw the candidates, voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see not one campaign ad. State legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and these electors can always defy the will of the people. This country is built on a democratic ground. This country is meant to be of the free, for the free. The electoral college is an anachronism, because when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. I personally don't want to vote for a slate of electors, especially when I vote for the candidate of my choice.

Not to long ago, in 2000, Al Gore had the popular vote, but why didn't he get the presidential placement? Because the electoral college perferred Bush. Now look at the country. It's completely biased, unfair, irrational, and down-right wrong. We're wasting so much time trying to figure out who even gets to be president, voting day is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November (don't even get me started on that one) and we don't even get to figure out who the new president is until January. I'm telling you, the system is corrupt. Do your best to fix this, I know you will, thank you Mr. Senator.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear State Senator,

Keeping the electoral eollege method shouldn't be appropriate for electing the next president. In source two it says that when you use the electoral college system and you vote,not only do you vote not only for one person but other people pledged to that person. Now,I don't think it's the best idea to choose this method despite it being a more simple process but using the popular vote method sounds more fair,source two also says that someone won the popular vote but the electoral college prevented him from becoming the next president. The electoral college causes too much confusion,its unfair and it's caused more problems with voting.

Although,using the elctoral college method is more simple,it can cause a lot of confusion. If you vote for one person then you automatically vote for the other people pledged to that person. Many people who have ran for persident have lost due to the electoral college method but they've won the popular vote. Its possible that when you are voting you don't know who else you're voting for.

To continue with,the electoral college method can be unfair because of the people who lost due to the system. Some people that ran for president won the popular vote but lost the electoral college vote. Others also lost because of the ""winner-take-all"" system,it awards every elector to the winning presidential candidate.

This method has caused problems with voting because of it being unfair. Some of the problems its caused was how others win automatically if the president they pledged to won the electoral college vote. This method of voting has to go.

In conclusion,the electoral college voting system shouldn't be used again in the future becasue of its confusion. It can have you voting for someone pledged to the preisdent that you didn't wan to vote for. It can also be unfair. Many people lost because of this method but won the popular vote. Last it's caused too much problems as a voting system in general.                             ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The idea of a four-day school week with ten-hour days is becoming increasingly popular in the education community. While there are certainly advantages to this schedule, there are also some disadvantages to consider. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of a four-day school week for students, teachers, and school staff, and consider if this schedule is feasible for my school.

One of the main advantages of a four-day school week is that it can improve student engagement and attendance. With more time off each week, students are less likely to feel overwhelmed or burned out, which can lead to higher levels of engagement and better academic performance. Additionally, students may be more likely to attend school if they know they have more time off each week. This can be especially beneficial for students who come from lower-income families or have other responsibilities outside of school.

Another advantage of a four-day school week is that it can help reduce stress levels for teachers and school staff. With more time off each week, teachers and staff are less likely to feel overwhelmed or stressed, which can lead to better job satisfaction and a more positive work environment. Additionally, teachers and staff may be more likely to take advantage of their time off to engage in self-care activities, such as exercise or hobbies, which can improve their overall well-being.

However, there are also some disadvantages to consider when implementing a four-day school week. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be difficult to fit in all of the necessary curriculum and extracurricular activities. With fewer days in the week, teachers may need to condense their lesson plans or reduce the amount of time spent on extracurricular activities, which can lead to a less well-rounded education for students. Additionally, schools may need to hire additional staff to cover the reduced hours, which can be expensive and may not be feasible for all schools.

In conclusion, a four-day school week with ten-hour days has both advantages and disadvantages to consider. While it can improve student engagement and attendance, reduce stress levels for teachers and staff, and provide more time off for students, it can also be difficult to fit in all of the necessary curriculum and extracurricular activities, and may not be feasible for all schools.

"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! 😃

I am so stoked to write about why I love the park! 🌳🏞️ Like, I know it's not the most glamorous thing to talk about, but trust me, it's super important. 🤷‍♀️

First of all, let's talk about how the park helps me get my blood pumping. 🏋️‍♀️ I love going there to run, play soccer with my friends, or even just walk around. It's so much fun! 😍 And it's not just good for my physical health, but it's also great for my mental health. 🧠

Speaking of mental health, the park is like, the best place to chill out. 😌 I love sitting on a bench, reading a book, or just listening to the birds chirp. It's so calming! 🌞 Plus, it's a great place to clear my head and think about stuff. 💭

And let's not forget about the other things you can do at the park! 🎨 There are so many fun activities like playing frisbee, having a picnic, or even just people-watching. 😂 It's like, the best place to be on a sunny day! ☀️

But, like, the best part about the park is that it's always there for me. 🌟 No matter what's going on in my life, I can always go to the park and feel better. 💕 It's like, my happy place! 😊

So, yeah, I could go on and on about why I love the park. 😂 It's just, like, the best thing ever! 😍 I'm so glad we have it in our neighborhood. 🏡 Thanks for reading, Mrs. Johnson! 😘",1,llama2_chat,3
"Electronic devices nowadays are in everyone's pockets, everyone has one, even kids.

In these times, it is essential to have one, even poor people can have an electronic device. With that being said they are always in people's faces everywhere you go, when we're walking, shopping, even when people are working they have their phones out, but if your job requires this it's ok. People always tend to be distracted by their devices which leads to them blindly making mistakes that could have easily been avoided if their head wasn't stuck in a phone. With that being said, the question for today is, should phones be allowed while driving in an automobile.

I personally don't think that phones should be allowed while driving unless you have your phone propped up in your car, and you're using it for directions, therefore you're in a place of need for your device. Otherwise i don't think you should be recklessly texting and driving because that doesn't only put you and your passengers in danger of crashing but also everyone else on the road around you. These types of fatal accidents always happen, because people think they can be aware enough to be on their phone and drive. An estimated amount of about 391,000 people were injured in texting and driving related crashes in 2017. This goes to show that you should always be careful because I am pretty sure everyone of those 300 thousand people didn't plan on getting into an accident before it happened.

Texting and driving is dangerous, it kills hundreds of people every year, especially since there are new drivers every year. Teen drivers are usually the ones who text and drive the most, which is another reason why teen crashes are at an alltime high. That doesn't mean adults don't do it, I personally know someone who was always on their phone when they were driving.

Texting, talking, or just catching up on social media, which is so irrelevant while you are driving. This person didn't learn until they crashed their car by rear ending a truck, and can you guess why this incident happened? It was because she was talking on her phone while it happened.

Being on your phone and driving can be avoided with all the technology we are starting to have now. Now we have tools that can hold your phone in a visible position without distracting your view from the road, And you don't have to hold it. Modern vehicles are also being made with built in screens which is like it's own phone in the car, which you can operate while parked, and some features while you are driving. Society is constantly upgrading so that incidents like these can stop happening so much, because they are so preventful. We as a society are starting to put our phones down, especially because if you are seen by a police officer with a phone in your hand while you're driving you can instantly get pulled over and get a ticket.

As a driver myself I try not to use my phone while I'm moving, I personally try to wait until I'm stopped at a red light or I stop at a stop sign. If I need directions I can put the computer in my car and it'll take me to my destination the same as my phone would. If I want to send a text, I can either use Siri or just call the person and use a handsfree call. We as a society need to learn how to work around the dangers when it comes to things like this that can put our lives in danger, and random innocent people in danger also. Because if we don't preventable tragedies like these will never end.   ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The effects of technology on society have been seen both positively and negatively. In the present, technology has allowed people to connect across physical boundaries in ways that were previously impossible. Social movements, including those focused on education reform and civil rights, have been effectively organized through technology. However, people’s heavy reliance on technology can also have serious consequences. Face-to-face interaction is becoming increasingly rare as people spend more time interacting with screens than with each other. This has been linked to aggressive behavior when people are told to limit their use of technology, as well as a general lack of social awareness and inability to interpret body language. 

In the past, technology had limited importance in society. People were largely disconnected and isolated from one another, hampered by the slow speed of communication and resulting misunderstanding of different cultures. As technology has advanced, it has given people the capability to exchange ideas and collaborate in ways that were not previously possible. 

To counterbalance the potential issues caused by technology, people should prioritize face-to-face interaction, foster empathy during conversations, and be mindful of their own technology use. It is important to understand that technology is only one tool that facilitates relationships; it should never replace human interaction.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"There is a lot of technology being made to try to help human communication. Computers can read the emotions on the face of a human. Isn't that awesome !? This could help out with things that some humans dont want to say. Like depression or worriness ect. However some people still say that this technology will not be useful. I toatally disagree ! Think on the brighter side.

With this new technology it could be a little easier on the students. It could help the teachers know what type of mood the student is in. This would probably help by the teachers showing empathy to the students. Also this could stop conflicts with students. When two students are feeling angry you could remove them. I think this Technology is very valuable.

Also having a computer that know how your feeling at the moment would be such a big help. If it knows your feeling sad it could post ads to try to cheer you up. If your feeling happy it could play music to go with your spirit. When you are feeling confused about something , it could ask do you need help ? Also if you get bored with something it could make the next assignment different.

Evidence to support my claim that this technology is valuable is all through ""Making mona Lisa Smile"". "" Imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Huang predicts.

"The advantages of limiting car usage is a good thing because some people might feel stress out when they are behind the wheel but thanks to the limitied  usage of cars people can just walk and keep a calm mind and stress free. Also there would be more space becaues the car garge can used for somthing else like making stores. Then there will be less greenhouse gas. then we will more money. Finaly that is some advantages of limiting car usage.

One advantages of limiting car usage is the lack of tense or stress you will feel when you are walking instead of driving. When you are driving you feel so stressed out because you are nervues that you might hit some or might crash on the side of the road. Then you will have more of your time instead of rushing to get some were you will feel calm chilled and relaxed becaues you are walking the stress away. Next you will be able to spend more time with your friends and talk to them more instead of texting them and get in a reck. finaly that is my advantage of limiting car usage.

Second reason why is do to the lack of parking lots garages there will be more space for something more need a hospiltle or a store for food. Then we will have space for more homes so it will cut down the amout of homless people on the street. Also the lack of parking will help decress the amout of death in some because there will be less people starving on the streets. Then there will be spaces for resetraunts,fast food,and other places were people can work at so there will be more jobs avaiable. Finaly that is another advantage in the lack of car usage.

Third reason is there will be less greenhouse gases in the air. Then do to the lack of greenhouse gases there will be less polution in the air causing people not to get sick. Then do to the lack of polution the will survie longer and our omdoem layer will start to repair it self. Then we will be able to breath better and live longer. finaly that is another advantage of limiting car usage.

Inconlusion that are just a few possabilty's do to the lack of car usage's. One you will be less tense. Two more space for important places. Three the lack of greenhouse gas. That are noly just some advantages maybe there will might be more i the futer.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Do you think students should do community service? I don't therefore it'll take away the students after school activities. Students as myself don't want to pick up people trash after them and we have our own chores to do. And defiantly I think kids won't have time for that if they have homework or projects. Now let me explain my thoughts why students should NOT have community service.

First of all students have after school activities. Some students that do sports after school needs to work on getting an scholarship for there futures. Even though community service would look good on an college application but scholarships is affordable. You get in for free. If community service take that away from students then it'll be harder for students to maintain getting an scholarship. Some students can do sports or instruments. If you take that away from them then that's going to upset the students and kids can't do what they like. Doing this will ruin some students future plans. If they wanted to become something so they work hard on it and now there plan is not succeeded. Now they would have to change there plans for there future of something the students WON'T like.

Also, students like me have our own chores that we have to do. Us student don't need more work now. Doing this will stress and tire the students then in result they may come back to school lousy, grumpy, and tired to do there work cause of there exhaustion from working at both home and doing community service. I don't think PARENTS wouldn't like there kids going to school tired and exhausted from multi tasking after school. Beside elementary students is to young for all that cleaning. Kids go to school to LEARN not to pick up trash after people. This is the reason why I especially think students should have community service.

Most defiantly students do have homework. If you mix up community service and they have homework on that day, the students will not have enough time to finish there work or project, and then they'll get bad grades at school. If students get bad grades at school then they'll get in trouble by the parents all cause the principle gave kids community service. If students fail and then many parents will complain to the school about community service with upset parents. I don't think the principle will like that, Therefore no community services for students.

To sum this up, I recommend no community service for the students. Doing this well interrupt the students after school activities. No need for doing this, ruining something that students love and can make an future of. Students have there own responsibility at home and chores to do, So they shouldn't give kids more chores. Students have to defiantly to do there homework, why put homework behind and do community service if it's going to affect your grade? So this is why i recommend no community service",0,persuade_corpus,4
"As an average 8th grader, I think it's pretty cool to imagine that I could graduate from high school in just three years instead of the usual four. I mean, who doesn't want to get out of high school a year early and start their adult life even sooner? But, I also know that there are some pretty big pros and cons to consider when it comes to graduating early.

First of all, let's talk about the good stuff. If you graduate early, you get to skip that extra year of high school and all the stuff that comes with it, like more homework, more exams, and more drama with your friends. You also get to start college or start your career even sooner, which can be really exciting. Plus, you might feel more prepared for the real world because you're getting out there and experiencing things earlier.

But, there are also some pretty big challenges that come with graduating early. For one thing, you might not have as much time to figure out what you want to do with your life. High school is a time when you're supposed to explore your interests and figure out what you're good at, and if you're not there for the full four years, you might not have as much time to do that. And, if you're not sure what you want to do after high school, it can be really hard to make the transition to college or the workforce.

So, why do I think the three year high school graduation should be encouraged? Well, I think it's because it gives students like me more freedom and flexibility. If I can graduate early, I can start college or start my career earlier, which means I can get out there and start making my own way in the world even sooner. And, even though it might be harder to figure out what I want to do with my life, I think the experience of being out in the world and trying new things will help me figure it out faster.

In conclusion, while there are definitely some pros and cons to graduating high school in three years, I think it's something that more students should consider. It gives us more freedom and flexibility, and can help us get out there and start making our own way in the world even sooner. So, if you're thinking about graduating early,",1,llama2_chat,3
"Think about how many times a week we get in a car to drive somewhere. I know I drive to school, to lacrosse practice, and to spend time with friends on a weekly basis. Some people may claim that driving is a possitve aspect of our culture because it allows us to get from one place to another and accomplish tasks in a timley fasion, but driving in excess has some serious consequences. Although some may argue that it is impossible to completely cut out an action that is essential to our daily lives, and that cutting down on driving would not be adventageous, limiting the amount of time we spend driving has many advantages. Cutting down on automobile use will decrease pollution in our air, and make us healthier and happier, which is why many legeslators and cities are reducing automobile use.

Beijing, China, is the most polluted city in the world according to Robert Duffer of the Chicago Tribune in 2014. (source 2 paragraph 14) This is due to the fact that Bejing's automobile use is extremly high. When the city of Paris was faced with a similar crisis, it issued a partial driving ban that allowed people to only drive on days that the government said they could in accordance to their lisence plate number, or they would face a fine. (source 2 paragraph 10-19). This revolutionary ban caused the air pollution in Paris to drop so much that the ban was lifted after only one day. The drop in air pollution clearly refutes the claim that cutting down on driving is not adventageous. Cutting down on automobile use is beneficial to the environment because, according to Elizabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times in 2009 (source 1 paragraph 5), ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Limiting automobile use is crucial to cleaning our air and stopping the burning of fossil fuels, thus explains why is beneficial to limit our car use.

Although some might argue that driving a car to work is easier, evidence shows that people who limit their car use are happier and healthier. Rosenthal writes about the city of Vauban, Germany, where ""70% of Vauban's families do not own a car."" (source 1 paragraph 3) Heidrum Walter, a carless citizen from Vauban, states that, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" (source 1 paragraph 3) The concept of people being happier and healthier without cars is further proved in Bogota, Columbia, where, according to Andrew Selsky of the Seattle Times in 2002, ""For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million."" (source 3 paragraph 21) Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opprotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""as he rode his bike with his wife. The statements from Walter of Vauban and Plaza of Bogota show how limiting automobile use is advantageous to the overall well-being and happiness of people, thus we should limit our automotive use.

Limiting automobile use is so beneficial, that many groups and legeslators are supporting a society with less cars. The EPA in the United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act. (source 1 paragraph 9) David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, states that, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Sociology proffesor at Drecel University, Mimi Sheller, further elaborates, stating, ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift."" (source 4 paragraph 35) The support for a ""car reduced"" society by the US government and the EPA is the cherry on top to all of the benefits associated with driving less, thus we should limit our automobile use.

Society is changing. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. (source 4 paragraph 41) Now is the time to turn off the engine, get out of the car, and take a bus, bike, or train to work. By limiting our automobile use, we keep our air clean by burning less fossil fuels, and we are happier and healthier, which is why organizations like the EPA support the reduction of car use. We need to act today to save the next generation of citizens from ecological destruction. The benefits of reducing car use are countless, which explains why we should limit our automobile use.                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Would you want to be forced to do an extracurricular activity? It would not make any sense for our principle to force everyone to do an activity after school. It should be our choice on whether or not we want to do one or not. Also for some kids it may be hard to fit one into their schedule, they may not have transportation to and from the activity, or they could just not want to do an extra activity.

First, some kids might have to do things after school that wouldn't leave any time for an extracurricular activity. They may have to take care of younger siblings while their parents are at work. They could even have a job that doing an extra activity would make them late to. Also we have tons of homework every night that we have to do that takes up a lot of time. Basically many kids have way more important things to do and cannot make time for an extra activity

Second, transportation home from the activity may be a struggle for many kids. They could have parents that work so they would have no way to get home. Most parents are not out of work until hours after their children get home off the bus. Having to stay after school and not take the bus home would leave many kids without a ride back to their house.

Last, doing an extracurricular activity could not be in the interest of a lot of kids. They could be exhausted from a long day of school and just want to go home and rest. They could also not have much athletic ability that would make it harder for them to do a sport. As far as student council, yearbook, or other after school activities like those, although those things may be interesting to some students, they are definitely not to everybody.

In conclusion, our principle should not force us to do an extracurricular activity. It is time consuming, forces everyone to have to find a way home from school other than the bus, and may not be what everyone wants to do. We should have a choice on whether or not we do an extra activity. We are old enough to make our own choices and we dont need our principle to be telling us what to do inside and outside of school.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Marco Rubio and etc., I think that we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the sake of the people. With the Electoral College, your voice isn't really heard. Votes should be counted individually and America will get the president that they really want.

For starters, there was a situation back in 2000 where Al Gore won the popular vote but didn't become president. That my friend, is unfair. The Electoral College doesn't really prove who actually won. Although, the incident happens back in 1880, I don't think it should happen again. Most of America wouldn't really think of the president as the president. I must admit, the Electoral College is a quick way to send in the votes on election day but it isn't efficient.

Like stated in paragraph 10, voters don't vote for the president, but for the state of electors. The electors are basically anyone who isn't holding office. State conventions, state party's central and presidential candidates can pick the electors. Votes can't always control whom their electors vote for which why you should get rid of the Electoral College. Plus it's a dumb name.

Another reason why is because the people of this country will be pissed if another Gore vs Bush situation happens again. Electors are really in control, therefor if they dislike who's running against their political party they have a shot at voting for whomever they want. That's unjust, and frankly unfair. Especially if a huge state is at risk.

One counterclaim might be that the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves the majority of votes cast.

I don't want to vote and wonder if my voice will be heard. I want it to be guarunteed because that's what the United States is all about. It's all about us being able to choose the president. The Electoral College is unjust and is a waste of time. If you guys decide decide on letting us elect the president by popular vote, more young adults will start voting and we'll know out voices are heard.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Hey, so like, schools are super important, you know? They're like, the place where we go to learn stuff and stuff. And they provide like, so many ways of learning, which is pretty cool.

And they don't just teach us the basics, they teach us how to think and solve problems too. So, like, we can be smart and stuff. And it's not just about academics, schools teach us social skills too. Like, how to be a good friend and how to work in a group.

And, like, schools provide opportunities for us to explore our interests. Like, if you're into music, you can join the band or choir. Or, if you're into art, you can take an art class. And, like, it's not just about the classes, schools have clubs and stuff too. So, you can find people who like the same things as you and hang out with them.

And, like, schools are a place where we can make friends. Like, real friends. Not just, you know, the people we sit next to in class. But, like, people who we can hang out with outside of school too. And, like, it's not just about making friends, schools provide a sense of community. Like, a place where we can feel safe and supported.

"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student on the topic of the policy that students with less than a C grade cannot participate in any school activities:

Hey, so like, I don't know if you've heard, but there's this thing where they're talking about how students with grades lower than a C can't do any school stuff. Like, no clubs, no sports, nothing. And I gotta say, I think it's a pretty good idea.

First of all, it's gonna make students actually care about their grades. Like, if they know they can't do anything fun if they don't get at least a C, they're gonna try way harder in class. And that's good for them, 'cause they need to learn how to study and stuff. Plus, it's not fair to the other kids who are trying their best and still getting bad grades. They shouldn't be punished 'cause of someone else's laziness.

And it's not just good for the students, it's good for the teachers too. 'Cause if students are actually paying attention in class and trying to learn, it's gonna make the teacher's job way easier. They won't have to deal with kids who are distracted and not paying attention, and they can focus on teaching the stuff that actually matters.

Plus, it's gonna help kids figure out what they're good at and what they're not. Like, if they're not good at math, they shouldn't be on the math team. It's just gonna make them feel bad about themselves, and they might give up on school altogether. But if they can't do the math team, they can try something else, like art or music. And that's gonna make them happier and more interested in school.

And let's be real, it's gonna make the school way more organized. Like, if kids are actually doing their schoolwork, they're not gonna be distracting everyone else with their phone or talking during class. It's gonna be way more peaceful and productive.

i think that students could take community service. its not a must do thing so if they want to they cant but if they don't feel like they want to they don't have to.

If the person feels like its taking away to much time for stuff that they want to do they don't have to. if others want to help they can tutor elementary kids or clean up the litter they can even create other ways them self. when i see people doing community service that want to do it makes me feel good but if i see kids that don't want to do community service them it makes me feel bad that their doing it.

student that feel like they have the time and that their in the right place can do what ever they feel like doing . do you ever think about how the kids feel about homework or community service. some are different then others. some will do it, some wont do it. for people that want to help the community they can help around by a park, help old people, help old people cross the street and do all that for no money but just for the thought of helping people.

"Phones & Driving Essay

People use their phones for just about everything such as texting, talking,and the internet. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. But you cannot do these while driving. You can kill someone if you're not focused on the road. we have become focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our phones. Using a phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for some good reasons below according to the law.

1. Its illegal 2. You are much more likely to have a wreck 3. Texting and driving puts all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk, too, because you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap.

According online 11 teenagers die every day due to texting and driving. Teenagers are 400% more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving. AT&T's Teen Driver Survey found that 97% of teenagers think it's dangerous, while 43% of them engage in the activity anyway. According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving leads to 6 million accidents per year. Did you know 520 pedestrians were killed by distracted drivers in the United States in 2014.

"Attention all students if you don't want to graduate take online classes.

Attending school online is good idea people say however, do they not know the amount of distractions they will face if they were to just stay home. You never know what they're doing behind the computer, and plus the amount of money it will take just to get some classes. Attending school online is absouloutley a bad idea because Students will be distracted at home, No teacher will be their to hold the student accountable, and the money it will cost to take online classes.

What's more distracting sitting in a classroom learning or sitting in your room with all your beloved items around you. In a room you have a television or gaming devices even stuffed animals you like to play with. Not to mention that you have to just sit in your room behind a computer most of time. Eventually your going to want to do something. For example, my cousin took online classes and what he told me was that it was hard to focus while his game were just sitting right there in front of him. He even has a dog so once in awhile he would hear his dog scratching on the door trying to get in which then would lead to some barking making it even hard to focus. He did everything he could to try and focus on a screen for a long period of time but he couldn't so,consequently,he had to stop taking online classes.

Teachers,as of now,hold you accountable for not doing your work.

Some,if you don't do any work, can make you stay after school while students behind the computer can learn and not do work without consequences.

Yo don't even get extra help even if you don't get what you have learned. For example, my brother takes online classes and he is struggling with trying to complete work. All he has to do when class is over is press the power button and go to bed. There is no teacher to make you stay and make you finish your work because you are at your house.

The money it cost just to take online classes s absurd. Some can go up to more than 1,000$ which some people can't even afford, and how do you know your going to make the money worth it How do you know the person teaching is't just some scam. For example, my cousin paid about 900$ for classes and he was taught by someone who didn't graduate college. He ended up learning nothing and wasted his money on someone else.

All in all, Students shouldn't have to go through taking online classes. They shouldn't have to pay money if they are just going to get distracted and not even get help from the person who is teaching them. Schools does more to help graduate than what online classes does. Online classes will give you a higher chance of failing than just going to school. So before you want to purchase some classes go out and give schools a try and you'll be glad you didn't have to spend and waste your time on online classes.",0,persuade_corpus,2

I know that cell phones are a big problem in today's world and schools.

And if you have a no cell phone policy people are just going to sneak in phones. And just get in trouble when they get caught. Some parents might protest if phones are banded. Because those parents bought those for there kids so they can talk.

I think you should go with policy 1, which is where you allow students to have their phones in school but turned off, expect at lunch. The reason is what if your athletes need to call their parents to pick them up. Or the game is home not away. That is why policy 1 is the best choice for your school.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Making extracurricular activities mandatory for students is not a valid rule that should be enforced. I don't agree that all students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity, because whether students graduate or not shouldn't be determined by an extracurricular activity that they may or may not have done,and most of the students already do an out of school activity,and students shouldn't be forced to do something that they dont want to do.

So what, they didn't participate in an extracurricular activity, that shouldn't be a barrier for them to graduate. Just because they didn't take part in the chess club, or the yearbook committee doesn't mean that they should be held back. Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do. Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things. The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits. It does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter, if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity.

What if you dont have time? Most students already do an after school activity like sports, or a youth group. Some students even do multiple sports and still balance that with school. So for them to try and balance their after school activities, school, and now an extracurricular activity, it would be chaos. Students already go through enough stress with peer pressure, and their grades, and maybe just problems at home, so they shouldn't have to worry about this too. For example, maybe some students want to get a scholarship through playing a sport,and maybe their really good and actually have a chance at getting one. If you enforce that rule they would have to focus less on their sport and more on the extracurricular activity. So students who already do after school activities dont really have time for an extracurricular activity.

What if you just don't want to? Some students have trouble socializing with others. So maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too. Some students also enjoy their free time, time where they can do homework, be on their electronic devices, or just take a nap. So they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time. Students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something. I mean it is called extracurricular activity for a reason, because it's for extra credit, so it shouldn't be a mandatory thing that they have to do.

Students graduating shouldn't be decided by if they did an extracurricular activity or not,and the students who already do after school activities don't have time for for extracurricular things,and students should not have to be pressured to do something if its not mandatory, so I don't agree that students should have to take part in an extracurricular activity.

"Intro:

I know some people would love not to have to drive cars around and that's all well and good, but what people don't understand is that driverless cars are dangerous in my opinion. I would rather be safe driving in a car, than to be riding in the car with no driver

Body:

Let's just say that if someone driving a regular car and someone were in a driverless car, it would be the person in the driverless cars fault. Why? Because they don't think they did anything wrong and that they're following the driving laws. I don't think the person that was actually driving in the normal car is at fault, they may seem old fashioned but at least its safer.

Being the cofounder of the Google company doesn't mean you know everything, especially about transportation. This is just an idea but it doesn't mean it should actually happen. I understand that some people love cars that drive for them now but at least they still have steering power. I do however like that cars can brake for you when you're not paying attention. And I know that even driving in normal cars is dangerous, but its much safer being behind the wheel than to be just sitting in the car doing nothing.

Driving shouldn't be fun. It should be about learning, and to me learning isn't very fun. Driving to me should be a symbol of growing up not so you can go pick up your friends and go out. Maybe on some occasions, but overall its just a means of transportation from one place to another. But hey, this is just my point of view.

Conclusion:

Some people may not agree and call me crazy, but at least I know I'll be safe when I'm actually being the steering wheel. I would rather not see so many people in the hospital or dead because they wanted to not have to drive to their destination on their own. Driving isn't a terrible thing, it's when people start getting fed up is the terrible thing. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principle,

I feel that to be successful in life you have to help other people. Community service is a great way to get kids involved in other things rather than sitting at home and playing video games, or watching T.V. being active in your community is also something that would look great on a college application. It's kind of a win-win scenario. Think about it, what if you were stuck at home and had nothing to do? Most kids would say well I can go to the movies and see the same movie that I've seen a million times to squash my boredom. but i would say that you should go help pick up some trash at the park or, Help your next door neighbor with their homework. That would be the right thing to do.

Community service is also a good way to build character. It helps you to feel like you are worth something. If you help clean up a dirty lake and find out that you saved 100's of fish and wildlife, it is going to boost your confidence. Kids at school would rather just be in a clique or hang out with ""the cool kids"" to help themselves feel good, but hopefully they will learn that helping someone feels ten times better than making other kids feel bad. Sometimes, kids take advantage of people and make them do things that they don't want to do to make themselves feel good. That is not something that anyone wants to feel. I think that getting kids involved their community would be a good way to help them with school, home life, your confidence level, and even your attitude. But, most importantly it will help other people around your community.

I have told you my opinion and that is all that I can do because now it is your turn to decide what should be done. Should we leave kids to play video games all day, or should we get them active and help boost their confidence level. I hope you will do the right thing and choose the second one but if not, I know that i can't do anything about it. By requiring community service you will be helping these children greatly. It would provide A healthy and bright future for them to grow on.

"In the world we live today, almost everyone owns a car; or even two. The amount of people  in the streets going to work and to school is excessive. This is a real issue that is almost not discussed. There are cities in the U.S. that have more cars than there are people in the city, like in L.A., which is something excessive. It would be good to not use cars once in a while. That's why, some countries are doing an event every year where they don't use cars all day. And they'd have to pay a fine of 25$ if they violated the rules.

We have been using cars for a long period of time, and we will keep using them for much more, but it would really help if we did not use them as much. Because sometimes there is so much traffic, is better to walk. When you own a car, you get stressed out. We all hate those ""Bad Drivers"" and we get angry when they are stopping us or blocking our way, and that gives us stress. Sometimes you relay so much on your car that you even use it to go around the corner, and this does not help your economy at all.

Driving so much isn't helping the environment either. A lot of european cities have smog due to the pollution of so much cars, so they were forced to ban all cars that had odd-numbered plates from driving. If less people were to drive, there would be much less pollution. I don't think it would hurt anyone to walk once in a while.            ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"""All students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.""why? well because it helps you a lot in the future or now so the principal is right on letting every student do an extracurricular activity.

To me each student actually should participate in one or more activity. Because it helps you mentally and emotionally,and helps you get collage credits and be healthy. Many research has proven many reason why people should do at least one activity to help you benefit in life .Research has proven people who have done sports most likely wont have heart attacks or won't even have breathing problems or mostly any issues.

How it helps you benefit in staying fit or healthy or both is well playing a sport can really help you lose weight .help you be more active like for example playing baseball,basketball,track or even being a cheerleader and many other sports can help you a lot more then you think, because research has proven a lot that people who are more active are people who are benefiting from it a lot .

Another way it helps you is emotionally is because you get distracted and you dont think about the stuff that is stressing you all the time. you know you have a break from what is keeping you stressed because you are having fun. for example of having a way to distract yourself isn't just sports its working with other like helping out the councilor, helping out in making the yearbook, helping around in the school and not being just about you when your just thinking all about you well that is the problem. Instead of have all the students separated you can put all of the students each in different groups everyday that way people get to know each other and have fun .

collage credits also matter and playing a sport or just helping around the school would look amazing on a collage application . Extra activities would make a lot more collages be interested in you and most likely be interested in giving you a scholarship. You mostly get into a great collage because all the extra credit actually helps you get noticed by a lot of collages because they aren't just looking for people who have good grades they are looking for people who actually are more outstanding. Like grades are great, but how can you handle being nice . Have certain thing taken care of before anything . well how you take certain things serious because if you can't take your own high school classes seriously how are you going to take care of your classes in collage .Also collages are seeing how independent you are, and how well you do around others .

Having all the students do one or more extracurricular activity will benefit them so much of a lot of reasons why actually so you should try it out .Also because it doesn't hurt you to give it a try . I agree fully with the principal because not everything is a lot what you want you have to just go with it .",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Extending the school day by one and a half hours can offer a range of academic benefits for students. Depending on the activities available, students might be able to spend extra time on their studies and gain new knowledge and skills. Additionally, longer school days could provide students access to speciality programs, such as sports or music, and could offer more time for collaboration in team projects or mentor relationships. 

However, it is important to examine the potential implications of the extended learning time. There is the possibility that students may experience undue pressure due to the extra hours in school, which could lead to burnout or decreased motivation. Furthermore, the nutrition of students should be considered, particularly with regard to meals that may be needed during the extended hours. In such cases, adequate access to food and drink is essential. 

Overall, an extended school day has the potential to positively impact a student's academic performance, but certain issues should be addressed before making any revisions to the current school schedule.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Cell phones have always been a big conflict when it comes to school policies.

Many schools have a no phone policy. Other schools only allow cell phones during free times, such as lunch or between classes. I believe that students should be allowed to use cell phones at school during free periods. They provide valid communication, allow students to have more freedom, and shows that the principle has respect for her students.

Cell phones at school provide a way of communicating with other students. Say that OTHER_NAME was trying to find his best friend RELATIVE_NAME at school. Well, all OTHER_NAME would have to do is send RELATIVE_NAME a text asking him where he was. Then, RELATIVE_NAME could simply reply that he was out by the fountain at the front of the school, so OTHER_NAME could meet him there. Another scenario where your cell phone could be used at school, is if one of your friends is at home, sick, that way you could text them their assignments after each period. These are just a few ways that cell phones can be used for communication at school.

Freedom is a huge concern with middle and high school students. Allowing them to have their phone at free times gives them the perfect amount of freedom. It's just enough to please them, but not too much, so that it'll get them in trouble. Who knows? After a while the students could get tired of using their phones at school. At lest try to provide the students with freedom, and if that doesn't work the policy can be changed.

Almost everyone in the whole world wants respect. Especially teenagers struggling with a identity. Allowing the students to have their cell phones shows them that you have a certain respect for them. They'll be grateful that you allow them to have their phones. They will even start respecting you more if you have a respect for them. So, show your students respect and allow them to use their cell phones. I can guarantee that they'll return that respect.

"I would like to change the election for the president of the United States. I would like to vote for president myself and not for a slate of electors because then I can't really control who the electors vote for. Electors in the past have refused to vote for their party's candidate and I would be very mad if that happened to me. Voters feel like their votes don't count. The Electoral College, to voters, is unfair.

I don't like that representatives from each state, represent a number of voters that make a huge difference such as numbers from the hundred-thousands to the millions. Thats the only good reason about the Electoral College, when voter numbers from each state have a huge difference apart and the electors cast their own vote, but when voter numbers don't have a huge difference apart, I don't like what the elector

The number of electoral votes given to each state is bad because there can be a lot of the same numbers and an example is, Texas has 38 votes and North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana all of 3 votes. Each party has to have trusted electors because too me, if each party has trusted electors, then maybe a lot of the votes won't be the same. If the votes between the two candidates, are a tie, the voters still can't vote for them, themselves. Voters in toss-up should mainly be able to decide the election because they usually really listen to the competing candidates so they are usually the most thoughtful. Votes in big states aren't fair to smaller states because presidential candidates give alot of attention to big states than to small states.

The Electoral College, can sometimes give voters no hope to the candidate they want to win because electors could vote for the other candidate. An example is, Republicans in a state might eventually know that their vote will have no effect so they end up paying less attention the the competing presidential candidates. I think that thats a reason how plurality happens and voters think its unfair.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"From the invention of the telegraph to the endless notifications coming from our phones, it's clear to see that technology has drastically changed the way that people interact with one another. With the advent of the internet, communication has become almost instantaneous, and Now, conversations can be held with anyone in the world with ease. Social media platforms have given us an easier way to share our thoughts, feelings, opinions, and even pictures with our networks.

However, technology can also have a more detrimental effect on social interaction. Anonymity on the Internet can make people more likely to say things they wouldn't normally say in person. On social media platforms, people are often judged by their posts and likes, and this creates a false sense of security in interactions. People can also become overly reliant on technology for interaction, leading to fewer face-to-face conversations in daily life. This can have an isolating effect, and can lead to decreased social skills and inability to connect with people in more meaningful ways.

The increasing presence of technology in our lives has both its advantages and disadvantages. Technology has certainly made it easier to stay in touch with people, but it has also made it more difficult for people to really connect with one another. It's important to take time to engage in meaningful conversations with one another, in order to understand each other better and forge lasting relationships.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3

"Many car manufactoring companies are developing technology for driverless cars. This new technology will allow the car to drive itself with little to no help from the driver. By the year 2020, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Audi hope to have cars that drive themselves. This new technology could bring some problems to the roadways.

The problem of texting and driving is already getting out of hand in this modern time. Many people in this modern time own a phone and most of them text and drive. This new technology would tempt the driver to be on their phone while the car is driving itself. If something were to malfunction in the car, the driver would have a greater chance of not getting control of the car than if they were staying alert and driving themselves.

When more and more technology is put into a car, more problems can arise. With so many working parts crammed into one car, there is a higher chance for the car to overheat. This can lead to an engine fire which can envelop the car in flames and endander both the driver and passengers, as well as the persons who come to rescue the victims.

When driving, safety should be the top concern for anyone. Not just for them, but for the safety of the passengers as well as other drivers. With this new tecnology, parents of young children could let their child opperate the car without the child having their licence. Driving on any road is no position for a young child to be in. Children do not have the experience to opperate a car properly. With this new technology, some parents may think that it is safe to let their child opperate the car when they are actually putting everyone in the car at a higher risk of injury and possible death.

In conclusion, while driverless cars may be an idea not far around the corner, this new technology could arise some problems. Texting and driving cases would dramatically increase with the new technology. Also, all of the technology put into the car could cause the car to overheat. Finally, parents may think it is fine to let their young child opperate the car on roadways. When really they are putting the people in the car at a greater risk of injury.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Limiting Car Use

Many cities are now switching to become ""car free"".  The more that cities do this, we are seeing a decrease in pollution, less automobile related deaths per year, and more resources being conserved.

When cities switch to become car free, the pollution levels instantly decreasesd.  Due to the smog and the carbon monoxide emmitions in the atmosphere from cars, there is a hole in our Ozone layer in the atmosphere.  Now that people are banning cars in cities there is much more heathy air to breathe and it is much safer for our environment.  Also when there was more pollution in the air, and it rained, the rain turned in to acid rain causing erosion and killing several plants/animals.  If we could ban cars in more cities in the USA and all around the world, we would be living a much healthier lifestyle.

Also, the car free idea makes people much safer, as far as automobile accidents.  Because as the autombiles are banned from the city, the accident rate will go down more even than it already has.  Also Heidrun Walter said ""when I had a car I was alwyas tense.""  Not having a car, and not having the concern of crashing can relieve your stresses.  It is scientifically proven that when people are less stressed they get more sleep and have less angerment problems.  If cities switched to being car free, people could start living safer and happier.

Lastly, being car free, saves vital resources, and fossil fuels.  It takes millions of years to make oils, and gasses in the Earths crust, which we are wasting everyday on automobiles.  If we were able to save these resources, we could perhaps use more in rockets or space travel and maybe find another planet that can sustain our life.  If we were able to achieve this goal of saving resources, we could also all save money.  Imagine not having to pay for gas anymore.  You could be a millionare.  If we stopped using fossil fuels the world could become a much better place.

My point is, if we become car free, we could live safer, happier, and more wealthy lives.  If your community went the the mayor and state officials, it could happen for your city.  You could be the start to a revoulution and, start the journey to save humanity.  Not only would you get the bennifets of living safer, happier, and wealthier, but the whole world would be living in a much better place.  Please take this into consideration and make an effort to become ""car free"".               ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Dear Principle,

I don't believe that removing students right to have cell phones is a smart thing to do. Although it may stop students from being distracted at school, it only stops them in that small way. There are still many other distractions that teachers need to worry about more. Students should be able to use cell phones during there free time, and just turn it off during class. It doesn't distract anyone, it allows students to socialize better, and it allows students to contact important people, such as there parents.

If students only use cell phones during lunch, after school, or at other free times, it won't be a distraction. Its about the same thing as not having a cell phone at school at all, except that they can use something they want to use when its an appropriate time. As long as they are not using there phones in class. Some of you may say that even though students aren't ""allowed"" to use them in class, some will still sneak a text or two. That if you get rid of cell phones completely at school, you won't have this problem anymore. Wrong. If you consider the fact of kids still using the phones in class, who's not to say that they won't still bring them to school anyways? Plus, cell phones aren't the biggest distraction in the world. Friends are more of a distraction. It's as if you took away their right to have friends.

With a cell phone, students have the ability to contact their friends more, and maybe they can get more friends too. Everyone knows that the more friends you have the happier your life is. They can contact old friends too, to keep in touch. Friends aren't the only thing they can contact though.

Most importantly, it allows children to contact people for important things, like their parents. With a cell phone, students can talk with their parents or guardian when something important comes up. What if a student finds out there's a basketball game after school that they want to watch? If they can't contact their parents, they can't go to the game, because their guardian would worry about them. If their parents need to contact them about something important, they can just call your cell phone. Cell phones give kids better and more continent contact.

In the end, it's better to just let kids have their cell phones. If they don't use it in class, it doesn't distract their and others education. It allows them to contact friends, and most importantly family, especially when something important happens. Why would you want to get rid of that?

"Dear Principal,

I think that it would be a bad idea to have phones in school during lunch periods and free time. I think this because that is probably the way we get gossip around, and we all know that gossip is bad in school. The bad thing about being allowed to have phones in school is that students will take them out during class and text. That will be a distraction for not only the student, but everyone around. The good thing about having phones in school is that if there is an emergency at home, you will have your phone on your side. Being able to have phones during free time would be fun. We would not have to yell across the room to someone, we can just call the person. But then again, that would probably be the time that people would be spreading around gossip and rumors.

We all still use phones in school, even though we are not suppose to. We get them taken away, and when our parents find out, there is usually consequences at home. I hope you know now that having phones in school can be both a bad thing and a good thing, but I will stick with it being a bad idea.

"Dear Senator,

The Electoral college can be greatly described as a pedigree. The Electoral College being around for so long as the time of our founding fathers- quite a long time, now having doubts? ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anaschornism,"". Can't say that anyone shouldn't be surprised just like anything in this life everything comes to an end at some point. Agreed that it is unfair something like the Electoral College to be around especially in this era, it craves more rights than it feels it's been restricted from. Yes, it has a history that truly lights the room of American development, but already many things from the government have changed, Would it really hurt to change the Electoral College?

America has always been about the people? With the Electoral College it's the people's choice with a twist. ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors,"" it would be much simpler if the candidate you voted for would just be elected, and also democratic to choose that way...totally giving your vote to a group of people. Although their hasn't been numerous situations in which the Electoral College vote will dosen't win the national popular vote...It still happened and also a possibility that it can happen again! Why have two different types of votes when you can easily have one vote? ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population)"" the vote is America broken in one whole breaking up the population in each state, which is equivalent to breaking us up in 13 colonies. We should be considered one!

""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November."" Example that everything is in order and exact, and has not changed just like how over the years we have found that some things that our Founding Fathers did were ""wrong"" why not put doubt in the electoral vote? Yes, also true the electoral vote keeps other parties who are not sufficient enough to run the country, but their aren't many voters usually not voting for either a republican or democrat, proof that the electoral vote simply is an anachronism. A winner-take-all basis dosen't seem like that big of a deal after all only one person has to be president, but the electoral vote dosen't affect that...at all. Any rebuddle going against a non-electoral voting society dosen't seem to make a valid reason.

A Senator like yourself has power for the better of the people...and would use their powers wisely people would hope. No doubt you haven't thought about it, or haven't made action to the problem, but this letter is simply a right this country has given me as a citizen-freedom of speech.

Engaging in active vs. inactive activities has been a topic of debate for years. While it is widely accepted that active activities are better for our physical and mental health, there are also benefits to engaging in inactive activities. In this essay, I will explore the benefits, drawbacks, and implications of engaging in active vs. inactive activities.

Firstly, active activities such as exercise, sports, and outdoor activities have numerous benefits. They improve our physical health by reducing the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health issues. Additionally, active activities have been shown to improve our mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, engaging in active activities can also help us develop important life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving.

However, it is important to note that inactive activities can also serve a purpose. For example, engaging in activities such as reading, listening to music, or watching movies can help us relax and recharge. Additionally, inactive activities can also provide a sense of accomplishment, such as completing a project or achieving a goal.

To achieve accomplishments, it is important to set clear and achievable goals. This can be done by breaking down larger goals into smaller, more manageable ones. It is also important to have a clear plan and to stay motivated. By setting goals and working towards them, we can achieve a sense of accomplishment and personal growth.

Taking risks and facing fears are also important for progress and learning. By stepping out of our comfort zones and trying new things, we can learn new skills and gain valuable experiences. Additionally, facing fears can help us build confidence and resilience.

However, taking risks can also have negative consequences. For example, if we take too many risks without proper preparation or understanding, we may end up in dangerous situations. It is important to weigh the potential risks and benefits before",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Small acts of kindness can have an incredibly profound effect on others. Evidence suggests that when individuals take time out of their day to extend compassion and help towards strangers or loved ones, it can completely transform the lives of those that receive it. It is said that one random act of kindness can ripple out and create a positive impact that can reach hundreds or even thousands of people.

An example of this can be seen in a recent online story of a man named Shane Brooks. Shane was out for a jog one day when he saw an elderly woman struggling to carry her shopping bags home. He immediately stopped his jog and offered to help the woman carry her shopping on the rest of her journey. Although this simple act of kindness initially seemed small, it demonstrated a significant amount of compassion for the woman. In response to his act of kindness, the woman gave Shane a hug and thanked him for his help. This incident shows how small acts of kindness can have an empowering and immediate effect on those around us.

The power of kindness is an emotion and force that should never be underestimated. Individuals can experience long-lasting feelings of vulnerability, appreciation, warmth, or well-being when they are beneficiaries of a kind and genuine gesture. Moreover, showing kindness to others is a powerful way of connecting with them on an emotional level that can create lasting bonds and long-term relationships. Experiencing kindness in the form of words, recognition, or appreciation, to name a few, can have a hugely positive impact on our mindsets and sense of well-being.

In summary, small acts of kindness have the potential to have a huge impact on those who experience them. They often emphasize the feeling of togetherness between individuals and also restore faith in humanity. Examples of these acts can range from holding the door open for someone, offering compliments, writing someone a thank you note, or simply helping a stranger in need. Whether big or small, any act of kindness can have a powerful and lasting effect on both parties.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"A positive attitude is a crucial element in achieving success in life. It can positively impact one's mental health, give opportunities in life, and prevent someone from graduating high school. On the other hand, a negative attitude can negatively impact success and mental health.

Research has shown that a positive attitude can improve one's mental health. People who have a positive attitude tend to have lower levels of stress and anxiety, which can lead to better overall well-being. A positive attitude also helps individuals to focus on the positive aspects of their lives, which can lead to increased happiness and satisfaction.

Moreover, a positive attitude can give individuals opportunities in life. It can help individuals to achieve their goals and dreams, as they are more likely to be motivated and persistent in their efforts. A positive attitude can also help individuals to build strong relationships with others, as they are more likely to be approachable and empathetic.

On the other hand, a negative attitude can prevent individuals from achieving success. People who have a negative attitude tend to focus on the negative aspects of their lives, which can lead to decreased motivation and productivity. A negative attitude can also lead to increased stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact one's mental health.

Finally, research has shown a correlation between having a positive attitude and achieving success. People who have a positive attitude tend to be more optimistic, persistent, and motivated, which can lead to increased success in their personal and professional lives.

In conclusion, a positive attitude is a crucial element in achieving success in life. It can positively impact one's mental health, give opportunities in life, and prevent someone from graduating high school. On the other hand, a negative attitude can negatively impact success and mental health. Therefore, it is important to cultivate a positive attitude in order to achieve success in life.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Have you ever had to do a summer project? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Summer projects should be student-designed because students would more likely understand how to do the project, it would be less work for the teachers, and there would be a higher chance of students doing the project.

Although teacher-designed summer project would be more academically challenging for the students, students are more likely to understand how to do the project if they are able to design it. For example, when my sister was in tenth grade she did not do her summer project because the teacher did not explain it well and she didn't understand how to do it. This shows that if summer projects were student designed, students would have a better understanding on how to do the project.

Secondly, a student-designed summer project would be less work for the teachers. For example, my ninth grade English teacher was so focused on preparing us for our final that she didn't have enough time to design a summer project. This shows that if students were to design their own summer projects, teachers would have less work and more time to focus on grading and teaching.

Lastly, if students could design their summer project there would be a higher chance of them doing the project. For example, if a teacher made a summer project about researching China but some students prefer to research about Rome, students wouldn't want to do the project because they aren't interested in China. This shows that if students were to design their own project they would make it around their interests and would more likely do the project as well as enjoy it.

In conclusion, I encourage you to write a letter to your local school board and inform them on why summer projects should be student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because students would more likely understand how to do the project, it would be less work for the teachers, and there would be a higher chance of students doing the project.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"In my opinion I think cell phones shouldn't be used while driving because it has a big impact on the people. It has bad causes such as people getting into life threatening wrecks and people can't just focus on the road. People use them to text while driving and they thousands die because of it every year. It has a terrible impact on today's society because we can't put phones down.

Phones are not good to the public because people can't focus on the road and the environment surrounding them. Even though you can call the authorities with a swipe of a finger, they are the reason they get into the wrecks. I feel like if you have an emergency you should pull over instead of stopping and causing a wreck. People just don't think about the outcome of using phones while driving. People only don't have to look out for themselves but other drivers.

Phones not only distract us from the road but from our day to day life. They distract us from spending time with our families and friends. It also distracts us from watching movies. It distracts us from just the good moments we have and share. Phones are a very distracting thing to our lives and they need to be put down for a bit so we can have some actual time to ourselves. Everyone sticks to social media now and it just isn't good.

In Conclusion phones are no good to us and our day to day life. I think people shouldn't text and drive or just be on their phones in general because it could be fatal to your health if you get a wreck or just looking at your surroundings.   ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Summer school projects should be in students-designs over than teachers-designs.

Having a student create their own project is a huge accomplishment. Reason why is because it takes a lot of time to think and create a whole project by them selves. A student design would be perfect because they can write and explain their own project that they wrote on their own. Students will have a lot of intrests and motavation with the student-design. Teachers can also learn something new about the students projects.

Secondly, teacher-designs is very difficult for a student because they wouldn't have any energy or fun in what the teacher gives out for them to create a project. Not many students would try their very best reason behind it is because they find it very boring. Another reason is because they don't have a teacher to help them and have them follow through to create the project that they designed for them to do. For a example a student having his own creative project he/she designed their selves wouldn't need help from a teacher and also it's more interseting for a student creating their own project than a teacher-desgins.

Third, students will learn a lot more with their own intersts with the project. Not everything has to be about school for an example it can be about economics, places, food, or anything. it will allow them to do good and they have many choices to pick. Students will gain a lot of strength on their own during that time and believe that if they can do the projects by their selves they can do anything during the school year. Teachers can see the students strengths and weakness by seeing their projects that they have created on their own and its very helpful for the teachers because they can later on help their own students create a better project in the future.

finally, Students rather choose student-designs over teacher-designs. Reasons why is because students love creating their own work and have their own ideas. Many of the students are creative and love to put intersting topics, sentences, and pictures on their projects. Teachers love the creativity the students come up with. Many of the teachers are suprised on what their students have created and what they have learned over their break. It's important for a student to create and have their own work done with out any suggestings or help by a teacher. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Some schools propose the idea of distance knowledge as an option for students to take online classes or having meetings from home. I honestly don't agree because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school and not at home, socialize better and understand what is outside of the world. Here is why I don't agree by this reasons.

My first reason of why, I dont agree that students should take classes at home is because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school. My mom always taught me that is better having a good education when you are in the environment, because you see people around you that are having the motivation to learn everyday. When my mom was in high school, her education was easy because she got the support by her teachers in any classes that she couldn't understand. Many of her friends were working hard to get good grades, she never did homework at home; it was difficult for her to study in an environment where people usually can get lazy in their own space to have any break. ""You can't compare a temple with a laboratory science, both are too opposites and what happens with school is the place where you have to focus for what you are learning while our home is the space where we can take any break after our hard work"". My mom

My second reason of why, I don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students can socialize better when they are at school. As my own experience, we have the opportunity to meet other students while we our in classes. For example: ""I am very shy to ask a teacher any question, so I go and I ask to another student who does understand what the teacher is explaining"". Meeting new people in school is a good experience because you can make connections with any other students and teachers also; thanks to that communication, we can have that trust of our self to be prepared of anything. Therefore school can be our first path of having a good or professional communication with any person, for example, applying for a job.

Another reason of why, I don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students will understand what is outside of the world. As I said before, socialize can give us that trust of our self to be prepared of anything. The position of school of giving good education to students every year is the real path to prepare us for what is outside. One of my teachers, Mr. Generic_Name, shared to all of his class of how hard workers we have to be in life, he never gave up on his goals. At the beginning, it was hard for him after he graduated from high school to college because everything was different for him; meeting new people with a new environment wasn't easy, but he always tries his best of himself by using the same method that school gave him, by been open mind and having good communications with others. Mr. Generic_Name also believes that life is always a challenge for us and is better to face that instead of been afraid. ""I you think that school is the worst place where you can't handle it and you prefer to lock yourself at home, then you won't like what is outside"".

Some students may argue that is a better option to take classes at home because they don't feel comfortable with other students, if a student have an accident;the student can finish any work at home, or school is not the best improvement for them.

the reason of why some students don't get comfortable in school is because they might have the afraid for other students who want to feel superior from others and bullying is an obstacle for the them and not have the opportunity to defend themselves, or the other reason might be that they don't like to socialize. I personally believe, that students can find a better way to solve their problem by communicating with their own parents or with the teacher that they can trust, figuring out a way to make the student feel comfortable. If the student doesn't like to socialize and prefers to stay at home, the student needs to understand that even outside is not a paradise, people in school who can make him feel that the student is not alone and sometimes is better to talk.

Finally, if some schools offers the opportunity to study at home can be a good benefit for the student. Even tho is not a bad option studying at home, the best option to understand everything in classes is when you are in a building with other people with the same level as you are of learning and you can share any of your experience with others. One of this circumstance that can happen in life for example: If a student has an accident were he/she can't return to school for a while, is understandable that the student can do their work at home, but after they return as healthy they were is better for them to go to school because the student can still have the support from their teachers.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal,

Community service is great for students. It helps us understand what is going on in our community and how to help it. In every grade of school, students should be required to have at least a few hours of community service. It even looks good on an application to get into college. Community service also shows us that we are proud to be where we are and what we have.

First of all, community service lets us understand how we can help out in different ways all around us. From helping serve food at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to just helping pick up trash at our school. We can grow into being a better person knowing that we have helped. It can shape us for when we get to be adults in the world. Helping out in our community shows us what is happening on all sides of us.

After students graduate high school, most of them are going to college. When they get an application and fill it out saying that they have helped out in there community, then the college will consider even more to accept them. It shows that, that student is willing to help, work, and be a good person. Colleges want students who are smart and nice and who love to help out.

Helping out in a community not only helps other people, it helps you. Most students say that its to much work and we don't get anything from it. That is not true because we do get something from helping out. We get the feeling of pride and joy knowing that they have helped someone with less things than they have. You get a feeling that nothing else can really ever replace.

In conclusion, I think that there should be a requirement of at least a few hours to help out in our community. It shows us what is happening in the world around us and how to help it. Community service shows us how to be a better person and how to embrace being that person. Not only does it look good on a college application but it helps shape our lives in ways we can never dream of.",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Do you want to know every big choice our country makes? Don't you want help deside that choice? But with Electoral collage we as american citizen do not get to do that. The reason why I belive we should change Electoral collage is because citizen should controll any big desition, we have the right to vote for what we want,and we most know whats goes on in the goverment.

First and foremost why I aruge that we should change Electoral collage is that citizen should be in controll of our conutry. We should be able to vote for what happens in this conutry. It not fair that people in higher leves gets to say what right for our conutry. Every one should have say in this. Its unfair to voter to be treated like this. This is why I belive that we should change Eletoral collage.

secondly why we need to change is that citizen should dircetly vote  for candidates. we most know who were voting for but if we don't what the ponit of of voting then. If we can get to know each candidate we can be able to see which one do we want to help run the conutry. This is why I disagrue to this qutoe by Bradfrod plumer that ''voter sometimes get confoused about electors and vote for the wrong candidates? sametimes.'' No that amercia should have the right to vote for candidates because its our conutry.

The final reason I argue that we should change Electoral collage is that we most know what goes on in th goverment. We most be able to know is help rumming the conutry. that why I argue with Richard A. posner that ''its unfair for the voter.'' We need see and hear our candidates so we know the right choice for america. By doing this I know that america can will have less problems if the goverment and citizen worked togther more. This is why we need to change Electoral collage.

In conclsion we most change this system of voting. If we do america will be able to do bigger and better things. This is why if we I belive the Electoral collage wil be send america in the right dicetion.                                                                                               ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"First impressions are a fundamental part of human interaction, and they can greatly impact how people perceive and interact with each other. However, changing these initial perceptions can be challenging and difficult. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why first impressions are almost impossible to change and provide examples of how natural first impressions come to people, the role of the mind when forming first impressions, and how people are not prepared for the first impressions they experience.

First impressions are often formed based on physical appearance, body language, and tone of voice. These initial perceptions can be influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural background, personal experiences, and societal expectations. For example, a person may form a negative first impression of someone based on their race or ethnicity, even if they have never met them before. Similarly, a person may form a positive first impression of someone based on their physical appearance, even if they have never met them before.

The role of the mind in forming first impressions is also important. Our brains are wired to quickly process and categorize information, and this can lead to the formation of initial perceptions. When we meet someone new, our brains may quickly categorize them based on their appearance, behavior, and other cues. This categorization can be based on our past experiences and expectations, and it can be difficult to overcome.

People are also not prepared for the first impressions they experience. We often form our first impressions based on limited information and incomplete context. For example, we may meet someone at a social event and form a first impression based on their behavior and appearance, without knowing their background or personality. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, as we may not accurately understand the person's intentions or motivations.

In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change because they are formed based on physical appearance, body language, and tone of voice, and are influenced by our past experiences, cultural background, and societal expectations. Our brains are wired to quickly process and categorize information, and we are not always prepared for the first impressions we experience. It is important to be aware of these factors and to make an effort to form accurate and fair first impressions, in order to build positive and meaningful relationships with others.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Learning something new and helping others every day is crucial for personal growth and the betterment of society. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This quote emphasizes the importance of taking risks and exploring new ideas, which can lead to personal growth and development.

One reason why it is important to learn something new is that it keeps our minds sharp and active. When we learn something new, we are challenging our brains to think in new ways and to adapt to new information. This process helps to keep our minds sharp and active, which can lead to improved cognitive function and overall brain health. For example, learning a new language can improve memory, attention, and problem-solving skills.

Another reason why it is important to learn something new is that it can lead to new opportunities and experiences. When we learn something new, we are expanding our knowledge and skills, which can open up new doors and opportunities for us. For example, learning how to code can lead to a career in software development or web design.

In addition to personal growth, helping others every day is also important for the betterment of society. When we help others, we are making a positive impact on the world around us. Helping others can also lead to personal growth and development, as it can teach us valuable skills such as empathy, communication, and leadership. For example, volunteering at a local soup kitchen can help us develop a sense of compassion and empathy for those in need.

Overall, learning something new and helping others every day is important for personal growth and the betterment of society. By taking risks and exploring new ideas, we can improve our cognitive function, open up new opportunities, and make a positive impact on the world around us.

"The modern world dreams of many whimsical ideas that one day might be attainable. One of these dreams that is becoming a reality is the idea of driverless cars. Driverless cars are safer, cheaper, and allow more flexibility than modern cars.

New cars nowdays are expensive, with driverless cars there would be no need for a personal car because the driverless cars would form a public-transportation system. Also, driverless cars would cut fuel requirements in half due to their precise steering and breaking systems. The self-driven cars would remove the flaws that people make in driving further reducing wear-and-tear costs. Driverless cars are a step in the direction of cost free transportation.

Driverless cars are not only cost effective, but they are also very safe. They showcase many safety options that optimize the safety of those in the car and those in other cars. They will be able to sense and react to disasters much better than people do. The information relayed from the sensors better adapts the car to make the best possible decision whereas if a human would go by the fight or flight instinct and possibly hurt themselves or others.

Driverless cars are not only safer and cheaper than modern day cars, but they offer more flexibilty than them aswell. The idea that a car does not need a driver will enable the person in the drivers seat to do other things such as reading or doing thier homework. BMW is working on an assisted driving program named ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" that will enable the driver to do other activities while the car is driving itself and when the time comes that the car cannot overcome the obstacle that it has encountered, it will notify the driver to take control of it. The car company Tesla is working on a vehicle that is planned to be released in the year 2016 that is capable of driving on its own ninety percent of the time. These improvements are groundbreaking and will better the future.

The driverless cars of the future will better the world because they are cheaper, safer, and more flexible than modern cars. The possibilities that driverless cars bring are indefinite and are soon becoming a reality. The dreams of the past are becoming a reality in the present. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know that your trying to decide if the students at school should perform community service or not, and I would like to help you decide quicker by giving you some reasons and examples why you should require all the students to perform community service, to get credits before high school and learn how to take a part in helping the community.

To begin on why you should require all the students to perform community service is to help them get credits before they get into high school. I know that the teachers, principal, assistant principals and the rest of the staff at the school loves to see when a students achieve. Everyone at the school has a big part in a student life and a way to help them is to give them a head start. While the other students in high school is trying to get their credits so they can graduate from high school. The new comers which is the 9th graders would have most of their credits in that area and not have to worry about it that much then the 12th graders that can't find a way to do community service.

Another reason why you should require the students to perform community service is to teach them how they can help the community by doing simple things and saving the Earth without having to ""Go Green"". For example, if the students are sent off to pick up some trash in the sand by the beach , they will learn what the trash can do to the animals if it stays there in the sand. Some of the students might become heartbroken. So next time a student goes to the beach on their own time, they might just pick up a plastic rapper or a glass bottle because they know what those items on the beach can do to a sea creature or animal.

To conclude now you know the reason why should pick yes to require all the students to perform community service, so they receive credits before high school as well as take apart in helping the community.

"Advanced technology, has led to differences in school education. Smartboards, tablets, and laptops are all extra technology to help with students ability to learn in the classroom. Currently there has been an idea that some families may argue that is better for there child, which is at home learning. Learning that takes place at home via; videos, video chat, online class pages, and home school teachers. Students can benefit from homeschooling because it has a positive effect on there mindset and the maturity of that student. Families and students should be able to speak up about better means of education for that child.

Some children may have to overcome disabilities and or face those disabilities for the rest of their life. Those situations alone help that child in the long run. Going through what these students go through helps with positive mindset, but so does being home schooled. There are cases where students with disabilities bodies act different then the regular students at the school. For example; Amps, is a physical disorder that comes from the mind. Children that have Amps tend to lose control of parts of their body and just shake, but that also comes from the mind losing total control of those parts. It's unsafe to attend any school under this condition. Therefore; the importance of an education for these students is imperative. Homeschooling a child helps there self confidence and understanding that having a disability doesn't make them any less of a student then the others that physically go to school. Maturity comes from the mind; so by understanding the process of home school education students are better off, then most students that attend school. Getting well to attend school is the ultimate goal for children with Amps and other disabilities and being home schooled allows them to mentally see a future for themselves, in an education and health wise. These students with disabilities need a push and distance learning is all they need.

More then often, there are behavioral distractions in classroom by a handful of students. In that handful there are one or two that physically can't function accordingly in a setting with their peers. Students with that issue shouldn't only be handled or punished, they need to be in a setting where they can benefit and others can as well. Homeschooling takes away the problem for distraction and allows for maturity and growth within the mental state of a child. A student; constantly getting out of their seat, yelling out answers, and never doing classwork alone, can't only mean that the child has a disorder. Looking further into the child there may be situations where discipline isn't used at home and the child comes to school with no clue what's right or wrong in a public setting. Most of the time you can't blame that on a child, but the only thing families of those students and educators can do is make a plan such as, distance learning to help with both education and behavioral issues. One on one student and teacher education with classmates or desks can only benefit the child mentally. Understanding that the only person capable of their learning now is that child. They will show remarkable progress in the long run. Thinking, understanding, learning, and growing all components of positive and matured minds.

Hearing that the purpose for some parents enrolling their child into an athletic program, is to keep them out of trouble and for disciplinary issues can be very beneficial for the child. What happens when your child happens to become a well developed athlete at the sport, while in school? Most households could and would say that education is the main focus. Training Olympic athletes; such as gymnasts, which happen to be a very popular sport have demanding schedules. Their schedules require gymnastics to train at least five to eight hours everyday. What time do they have to attend school? Well these training athletes are home schooled which allows these student athletes to create a routine and schedule that works for them. Managing your time and efforts between both is a clear sign of responsibility and maturity, that can go a long distance in the real world with real jobs. Understanding the way of life now while in school and at a young age, helps for years to come. The earlier you learn the easier your life will be in the long run. Watching Gabby Douglas' movie about her life growing up training for the Olympics opened up a clearer visual. Homeschooling wasn't the first option for her because she came from a low income family. The way she understood what she needed to do to accomplish her goal, was how she allowed herself to make a way for homeschooling to work along with her career. Distance learning taught her self accountability and maturity her whole life.

Years ago education used to be different. Students had two choices they either went to school and got their education or they didn't. The ideas of these students actively receiving their education at home is brilliant in most ways. There are people that would differ about the benefits of distance learning, like how can aren't learning to work with others and how isolating a child to only learn at home mean they're going to follow through with there work. Complete and respectable thoughts, but learning at home for students with certain circumstances still is as beneficial and or more beneficial, then physically going into a school. Maturity counts for a substantial amount of success,also a plus positive minds comes with it. Accomplishing both those things; for students being taught at home goes to show that being at home and being at a school house aren't the same, but aren't totally different and that being at home while receiving your education is indeed more beneficial.        ",0,persuade_corpus,1

I strongly beleive Driveless care will be useless in in the future because it is illegle in most state and i will lose my driving skills. Even if we can afford them but if its illegle how are we going to drive and get around? First,nobody want to go to jail,just for driving a driveless car. Forexample,only California,Nevada,Florida and the district of colombia are the only states that allow the Driveless car because the other states knows that;it is just waste of time. Third,i rather drive a a normal car because i had already passed my lisence so i do not want to lose my driving skills. Finally,I still want to the driver,i dont like the ideas of car being its own driver.

I strongly beleive Driveless cars will be useless because it will be over price.

First,most of the Americans are middle class and most of us can not afford cars like this. Second,Most people buy used car because they can not afford the new one or they want to save up the money. Driveless car will waste alot of monet. Forexample, the gas and battery price willl cost alot because it uses battery for mostly controlling it self with gps. Finally,Driveless car will cost you alot and it does not gaurentee for a ssafety so there is no piont of wasting money on something useless.

I strongly beleive Driveless cars will be useless in the future because most people in USA hate changes. Forexample,I hated when my teaches changes my classes,and I hated when my coaches changes our practice time. People like the same routine,nobody want to charge their car over night or changes the oils with more expensive stuff. Third,most people like what they are driving everyday because they like the routine and it is affrodable. Finally,Driveless car will changes all the routine and it will cost alot more.

I strongly beleive driveless cars will be useless in the future. I beleive the engineer will pull it off in 2020 but it will not worth the time. First,Driveless cars are illegle in most state. Second,dirveless car will be over priced. Third,People hate changes so what is the point of making something that is useless. Finally,we love what we have and Driveless cars will just be useless for most people.        ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Some people say that the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. Others say it shows traces of civilzation on Mars in the past. There are many statements in the article that show evidence that the ""face"" is a landform, and not an actual face. I think it is a natural landform. Others say differently than I do.

There is plenty of evidence proving the ""face"" is a natural landform. The text states that the picture is actually a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A butte or mesa is a landform that is common around the American West. Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in thr Snake River Plain of Idaho."" The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa the same height as the ""Face on Mars."" This evidence proves that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform.

As you can see, there is planty of evidence proving that the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. After seeing this evidence, I still believe that the ""face"" is a natural landform. Others may still feel different, even after seeing this evidence. All we can hope is that NASA eventually figures out if it is a natural landform, or a face. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"We use cars every day, but have we ever actually stopped to realize the stress and pollution they cause? Now think just how many advantages there would be if we limited car usage. There would be less stress, it would be less dangerous, and there would be less pollution. Not only would we be helping the enviroment, but also helping to protect our families from the harm cars can cause.

Stress we all experience it. It's become such a big factor in everyones life. One of the most stressful things is sitting in a traffic jam when you are already late to work, but think, if we limited the usage of cars, there wouldn't be so many traffic jams. In the third essay, by Andrew Selsky, a man and his wife state ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress"". Traffic jams are stressful no matter where you are going. They make you impatient and easily annoyed. Stress has a very big impact on your health too. Sitting in a traffic jam every day and being under that kind of stress can start to affect your health poorly.

Cars are a very dangerous piece of machine. They are man-made and sometimes they have flaws. Some of these flaws might be a quick fix, but others may be fatal. Many people have lost their lives while at the wheel of a car. Many people have lost loved ones to terrible car crashes. Limiting the usage of cars will end up resulting in a lower crash rate. With a lower crash rate we can ensure the safety of our families, more than we ever could before.

According to the article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emmissions, just behind power plants."" Pollution is a dangerous thing. It may seem like nothing, but it has a bigger threat than any of us realize. Pollution is taking away all of the clean air we have left to breathe. With power plants emitting such harmful fumes, and now cars, our air is being polluted quicker then we ever thought possible. Helping to reduce car usage will reduce the pollution in the air. We will be, not only helping our environment, but also helping our children. As kids grow older, we can help them have a healthy earth, and clean air to breathe.

Considering all of the advantages to decreasing the usage of cars, we may want to join in on what parts of Europe and Colombia have already started to work on. According to the article by Andrew Selsky, Colombia has a ""Day Without Cars"" that happens once every year. This has been happening for three straight years. In German, there is a suburb where people live, and most do not own cars. While in Paris they have also started having a day of no driving. This has helped to clean up their air and decrease the amount of stress people go through while driving. Cars are very convienent, but are they so convienent when they cause so much harm.

"After-school homework clubs are becoming increasingly popular among parents and students alike. While some people believe that these clubs are a great way to help students stay on top of their work, others argue that they are a waste of time and resources. In this essay, I will argue that after-school homework clubs have both pros and cons, and that it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they are worth the time and effort.

On the one hand, after-school homework clubs can be a great way for students to get ahead of their work. By attending a club, students can get help from their peers and teachers, which can be especially helpful for those who struggle with certain subjects. Additionally, clubs can provide a structured environment for students to work on their homework, which can be especially helpful for those who struggle with procrastination.

On the other hand, after-school homework clubs can also be a waste of time and resources. For example, if students are attending a club for every subject, they may not have enough time to focus on other important activities such as extracurriculars or spending time with friends and family. Additionally, some students may not need the extra help that a club provides, and may prefer to work on their homework independently.

In my opinion, after-school homework clubs are worth the time and effort for students who struggle with their work and need extra help. However, for students who are already doing well in their classes, clubs may not be the best use of their time. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not an after-school homework club is right for them.

In conclusion, after-school homework clubs have both pros and cons. While they can be a great way for students to get ahead of their work, they can also be a waste of time and resources. It is up to each individual to decide whether or not an after-school homework club is worth the time and effort.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Adopting a 10 p.m. weekday and midnight weekend curfew for teenagers is a somewhat divisive issue, as it has both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, after-hours access to teenage hotspots would be restricted, and fewer late-night incidents involving minors would be reported. Furthermore, research suggests that teenagers’ brains may be wired to operate better when they receive sufficient amounts of sleep. With a 10 p.m. curfew, concerned guardians can be more relaxed about knowing that their children are getting enough rest and are safe at home. 

On the other hand, implementing a curfew could be perceived as the city council being overbearing and intrusive to the lives of minors, violating their freedoms and liberties. Furthermore, the enforcement of this curfew may be difficult and costly. Teenagers could also be discouraged from engaging in extracurricular activities and after-school programs that might satisfy their educational and/or creative needs, since these activities often run past 10 p.m. Even worse, the curfew may be seen as an invitation for teenagers to break the law, thus leading to further crime and legal issues. 

Overall, it is important to weigh the positives and negatives of imposing a citywide curfew for minors in order to make an informed decision about its adoption.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2

"It is a well-known fact that people have different personalities. Some people are outgoing and extroverted, while others are introverted and reserved. These differences in personality can have a significant impact on how people interact with each other.

One reason why people can have a bad day is due to their personality traits. For example, an introverted person may feel overwhelmed by social situations and may struggle to connect with others. On the other hand, an extroverted person may become easily frustrated or agitated in high-pressure situations.

However, it is important to note that people can also have bad days due to external factors such as stress, anxiety, or a difficult situation. These factors can affect anyone, regardless of their personality traits.

Despite this, people can change their first impressions of others. This is because first impressions are often based on superficial factors such as appearance or behavior. By getting to know someone on a deeper level, we can form a more accurate understanding of their personality and character.

It is also important to remember that people can change their own behavior and attitudes. For example, an introverted person may work on developing their social skills in order to feel more comfortable in social situations. Similarly, an extroverted person may work on managing their stress and anxiety in order to handle high-pressure situations more effectively.

In conclusion, people have different personalities, and these differences can have a significant impact on how people interact with each other. However, people can also have bad days due to external factors, and these days can affect anyone. Despite this, people can change their first impressions of others by getting to know them on a deeper level, and they can also change their own behavior and attitudes in order to better handle difficult situations.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
community service is a good thing to do but some kids just need to take care of other things like watching little brothers or sisters while your mother is a way working and i think that community service should only if the children volunteers in this. The children should not be forced to do this and also this can be used as a punishment if the boy or girl has done some thing really bad to were it goes to a point the child must perform community service for an mount of time depends on what they have done but. Community service is a good thing for the school and if the service is recycle things you find at your school floor maybe there can be a class for this. Were the students go and help the school by cleaning up trash up off the floor and putting the right items in the right bin or clean the windows and other things like help teachers file things and do things like a T.A. But the students must be the ones that volunteer in this or it can be used as extra credit for some classes and that way students will join in and help by doing community service at there schools or at home. community service can help you and help others around you and might enjoy the school or were ever you are helping at and by you doing this you not only help others and your self but you are also helping the earth be a better place.

"Driverless cars are the future of technology.

I am for the development of driverless cars. I feel that it would make life easy and more simple for people. The combination of todays technology in cars already consists of video cameras, sensors, GPS recievers, bluetooth audio, and more. All of which were made to make driving fun and different each time you would want to go somewhere. I feel that sensors will eventually be the brain of all technology. The article states that the information from sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far more better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

In my opinion, driverless cars would be safer because it wouldn't be the cause of any accidents or harm to pedestrians. GM has already developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger, other options under considersation are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. I also think that driverless cars would interpret driving in such a new way that it would make it both, fun and safe. Automakers have already started on making driverless models; Telsa has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz,Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive by themselves by 2020. The advancement on autonomous cars are already in the works, maybe we'll all own one sooner than we think.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear State Sentor,

Why should we change whats already been working for us? You would never know how the outcome of thing will turn out. I think we should kep the Electoral College out founding father established it for a reason. Would u rather vote for President congress or citizens i pick congress because they already know what u have to do in order to do certain thing, our citizens dont know as much.

According to Richard Posner "" the Electoral College is widely regarder as an anachrinism"" how can u say that now after years and years of this going on.  It advoids problems of elections. Even though states thst know their votes will not have aeffect it still can help. It doesnt belong in the past if it help us pick this many president. Electoral College help reduce when there is pressure for run-off to chose a winner.

Toss up states that can make a diffrence in the voting. Campaign focus on those the most cause they knowow important it is to them winning. In 2012 toss up states help the winner out because they are the most thoughtful voter. And the most thoughtful voter should be the ones the vote. Say's Richard Posner "" and for the futher reason that thye will have the most infromation and attention"" tell you how make of a imapct the toss up states our.

Just like a toss up states of course you going to want to go somewhere there more people to hear you. Thats why you chose a big state to help you out with that. Larger states will catch the capaign more attention rather than a small states becuase of the populations of people to help them out ask President Obama.

"I don't really think that it should be required to take community service, because people aren't always the cause of liter, polutants, biohazards, etc in their own community, however, if people would like to volunteer to help out in their community and get graded on it by the school then I would be open to the idea of that. People shouldn't be forced to do things they don't want to do. That's the only thing i have against this. Even though it would be benificial to the community. I would say let the kids that get detention and do bad stuff help with the community, to give them something to do outside of the detention room. Students that are proven avid literers should be held responsible for their own actions. But also another reason why I'm against this idea is that most citys pay a crew to drive around town, water plants, clean town monuments, pick up liter, etc. this could potentially take away their jobs. A great reason why the idea is good is it helps give the students a sence of responsibilty, and helps them know what work is about at an early age. Plus it gives the school a reputation as being good and caring for the community. But that isnt always what its about and the students should have an option to. It would be great assistance to the community though, teaching students how to keep things the way they should stay, clean. And give them a sence of respect to their own community. Right picture, Wrong idea. Now tutoring other students is another thing, students arent always open to the idea of helping other classmates with their work, but others are, again, being graded on volunteering would be fantastic for some of the helpful students.",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Thomas Jefferson's quote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" and how it can impact our lives and abilities.

Being idle or not doing anything can have a negative impact on our lives. When we are idle, we are not using our time and energy to improve ourselves or the world around us. This can lead to a lack of progress and growth, and can even cause us to feel stagnant and unfulfilled. On the other hand, always doing something can have many benefits. When we are productive, we are using our time and energy to make a difference in the world. We are constantly learning and growing, and we are helping others to do the same.

Being productive can also make us stronger and more helpful to others. When we are always doing something, we are constantly challenging ourselves and pushing ourselves to be better. This can help us to develop the skills and abilities that we need to be successful in life. Additionally, when we are productive, we are able to help others to be successful as well. We can share our knowledge and experiences with others, and help them to achieve their goals.

It is important to note that being productive is not always easy. It takes effort and dedication to constantly be doing something. However, the benefits of being productive are well worth the effort. When we are productive, we are able to make a difference in the world and we are able to help others to do the same.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson's quote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" is a powerful reminder of the importance of being productive in our lives. When we are always doing something, we are able to make a difference in the world and we are able to help others to be successful.

"""My fellow americans,"" a phrase said by many important people, like current president Barack Obama, implicates that the speaker is trying to portray a message. So I use that phrase for a reason, ""My fellow americans, there has been a current movement to limit the amount of time a person spends driving."" There are many advantages to limiting car use, that could make a big difference in the amount of greenhouse gases.

Take Vauban, Germany for example, a neighborhood where 70 percent of its residents do not own a car. This neighborhood follows a growing trend across the world, and is flourishing. Source 1 states, ""In the United States, the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously."" This statement is a perfect example of this growing trend. If many suburbs follow Vauban's example, then the amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere will plummet. This will then cause the ozone to repair itself and global warming can be stopped. Source 1 also states, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" This statistic is shocking! If the United States is responsible for a majority of the greenhouse emissions, then why has the United states done nothing to fix this. This is not the only example of this growing trend.

Another example is Paris in 2014. Due to the abundance of smog in the air, Paris banned driving cars for a limited amount of time. This fixed their problem, but Paris removed the ban after only one week. Source 2 states, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" Why would France stop the solution to their smog problem. The answer is, loss of revenue. Many companies during this ban lost revenue due to not being able to deliver their goods. Source 2 also states, ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has ... [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe."" This is a key factor in France's smog problem, and could be stopped by making a law limiting car usage.

One influential example is Bogota, Columbia. The citizens of Bogota have a tradition called ""the Day Without Cars."" They have been honoring this tradition for three years straight, and other countries around them are starting to take notice of its effects. Source 3 states, ""For the first time, two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event."" This statement shows how much of a pressing matter smog is to normal ppeople around the world. Source 3 also states, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" A day without cars not only helps the enviroment, it also mentally helps a person. If this could lower stress world wide, then less people would suffer from stress related injuries. Source 3 states, ""... and new restaurantsd and upscale shopping districts have croped up."" This tradition also helps the economy and can lower the percentage of people under the poverty line by creating jobs and helping people start their own business.

Three examples of cities or countries that have, at one time, stopped the usage of cars were shown in this essay. If all of the benefits from limting car use, like strengthening the economy, are true, then why has the world not caught on to this idea and helped it flourish. This essay has shown the benefits of limiting car use, but it is up to you to make a difference.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"My position on driverless cars are that its a good idea. I think its good idea beccause it will cut down on fuel, not as many deaths because the people won't be driving it, it will be more comfortable and flexable. Driverless cars are a good idea to stay safe and get to somewhere more efficient, better than a taxi.

To have driverless cars mean that they could cut down on fuel. In the text it says that one of their cars used half of what taxi cars use right now. They will not have to deal with deaths because the driver is not driving. In the passage it shows that the car ddrove half of a million miles and did not crash once. Many of accidents today are because of people that are drunk driving, but because of the driverless cars there wont be as manny deaths as there is right now.

Other ideas are that people are not comfortable in the car. They could finally be comfortable in the car because they dont have to drive. Just think of this you can sleep in the car and no accidents could happen. You could get to places farther in a more efficient time.

Therefore, I think having driverless cars are a good thing to look forward in the future. You could have no more pollution and no more crashes and deaths. So look at the bright side of driverless cars instead of the bad sides. Driverless cars are a good thing to think about having in the future.   ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Long summer vacations have been a topic of debate for many years. While some students believe that long summer vacations are beneficial, educators argue that they are detrimental to students' academic progress. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the opinions of students and educators on long summer vacations.

On one hand, students argue that long summer vacations are beneficial because they provide a much-needed break from school. During the school year, students are constantly bombarded with assignments, tests, and deadlines. A long summer vacation allows students to recharge and relax, which can lead to improved mental health and overall well-being. Additionally, students argue that long summer vacations provide an opportunity for students to pursue their hobbies and interests outside of school. This can lead to personal growth and development, which can benefit students in the long run.

On the other hand, educators argue that long summer vacations are detrimental to students' academic progress. They believe that students forget what they learned during the school year and lose their academic momentum. This can lead to a decline in academic performance when they return to school. Additionally, educators argue that long summer vacations can lead to a decrease in students' motivation and engagement in school. This can be particularly problematic for students who are already struggling academically.

Personally, I believe that long summer vacations have both advantages and disadvantages. While a long break from school can be beneficial for students' mental health and personal growth, it can also lead to a decline in academic performance. As a student, I have experienced both the benefits and drawbacks of long summer vacations.

During my summer vacations, I have had the opportunity to pursue my hobbies and interests outside of school. This has led to personal growth and development, which has benefited me in the long run. However, I have also noticed a decline in my academic performance when I return to school after a long summer vacation. This can be particularly frustrating, as I feel like I have to spend the first few weeks of school catching up on the material I missed during the summer.

In conclusion, the opinions of students and educators on long summer vacations differ significantly. While students argue that long summer vacations are beneficial, educators argue that they are detrimental to students' academic progress.

"Technology has had a significant impact on the way humans live their lives. From smartphones to smart homes, technology has made everything from communication to daily tasks easier and more efficient. In this essay, I will discuss the positive impact of technology and how it has made our lives easier in various ways.

One of the most significant ways that technology has impacted our lives is through communication. With the rise of smartphones and social media, people can now communicate with each other from anywhere in the world, at any time. This has made it easier for people to stay in touch with friends and family, even if they live on the other side of the planet. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to connect with others who share their interests, through online communities and social media platforms. This has led to the formation of new friendships and even romantic relationships.

Another way that technology has made our lives easier is through the automation of daily tasks. Smart homes and smart devices have made it possible for people to control various aspects of their homes with just a few taps on their smartphones. This includes everything from turning on lights to adjusting the thermostat. Additionally, technology has made many jobs more efficient, by automating repetitive tasks and allowing people to focus on more important work. This has led to increased productivity and efficiency in many industries.

Technology has also had a significant impact on healthcare. With the rise of telemedicine, people can now receive medical care from the comfort of their own homes. This has made it easier for people to access healthcare, especially for those who live in rural areas or have mobility issues. Additionally, technology has made it easier for doctors to diagnose and treat illnesses, through the use of medical imaging and other diagnostic tools. This has led to improved health outcomes and a reduction in the number of deaths caused by untreated illnesses.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on the way humans live their lives. From communication to daily tasks, technology has made everything easier and more efficient. Additionally, technology has had a positive impact on healthcare, by making it easier for people to access medical care and for doctors to diagnose and treat illnesses. While there are certainly some negative aspects of technology, the positive impact it has had on our lives cannot be denied.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Hey, guys! For our class assignment, we have to research the pros and cons of short and long summer breaks for students and how it affects education. I know, it sounds like a total snooze fest, but trust me, it's actually pretty interesting! 😅

First off, let's talk about the pros of short summer breaks. One of the biggest advantages is that it gives students a much-needed break from school. Like, can we be real here? School can be super stressful, and a short summer break can help students recharge their batteries and come back to school feeling refreshed and ready to learn. It also gives them a chance to relax and do things they enjoy, like hanging out with friends, playing sports, or traveling. 🌴

Another pro of short summer breaks is that it can help improve student motivation and engagement. When students have a longer break, they might feel more motivated to learn and engage in school activities. Plus, they can explore their interests and passions without feeling rushed or stressed about schoolwork. 🎉

Now, let's talk about the cons of short summer breaks. One of the biggest disadvantages is that it can be difficult to fit in all the learning material into a short period of time. When students have a longer break, they can spread out their learning and take their time to fully understand and retain the material. With a short summer break, they might feel rushed and struggle to keep up with the curriculum. 🤔

Another con of short summer breaks is that it can impact student's physical and mental health. When students don't have enough time to relax and recharge, they might feel burnt out and stressed, which can negatively impact their mental health. Plus, they might not get enough physical activity, which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and poor health. 🏋️‍♀️

Now, let's look at the pros and cons of long summer breaks. One of the biggest advantages of long summer breaks is that it gives students a chance to explore their interests and passions without feeling rushed or stressed about schoolwork. They can take on internships, volunteer, or participate in extracurricular activities that can",1,llama2_chat,1
"Our principal has decided that every student must be at least one extracurricular activity. In my opinion ,I strongly disagree with the principals decision and I think students should have the option and freedom to choose whether they want to participate in school activities or not. So today I'm here to explain why this is a bad idea and hope you will agee with me as well.

First of all,most students after school are busy, at least I know I am. When I'm done with school and go home I immediately get ready to go to the gym with my mom, I go to the gym at least 2 hours ,after that I go do my homework ,then prepare for my piano lessons at the community center ,and now adding an activity I'm forced to do my schedule gets pretty tight . Thats also a main reason why students dont go to school activities, they simply don't have enough time. But after the principals decision , students have to re-organize their schedules making them have less time to do the things they really want to do.

Secondly , what if students don't like the activity they are forced to do. Yes, I know they are plenty of choices to choose from , but theres a chance students won't like any of them. It will make them feel pressured, stressful, and not joyful about going there. The student may also rebel , leading to them acting bad around the students and making the activity simply unpleasant.

Lastly , this school activities makes it feel like an extra hour of school. We already have enough homework and stress coming at us, so why should we get more? I get that the school is trying to make us be productive and help our school in a fun way with our friends , but whats the fun if we are getting forced to do them, also when students are getting forced to do an school activity it makes students feel like they have to do an extra class that doesn't even help our grades , nor does it count as a grade.

In conclusion, this are some of the reasons I disagree with the principals decisions. I hope this could change your and the principals mind and take in considerate on students opinions as well.

Students should choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities and not be forced to. Thank you for taking your time reading this :)  ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear principal,

As you may know many of our students are either against the decision of changing the grade average to participate in a sport from C average to B. Or they agree with you. In my opinion i think its unfair, because we already work hard to maintain a 2.0 to be in a sport we love. and now with you changing the grade average. Honestly its going to be hard for some of us students, because some of us struggle already to maintain a 2.0. In my case and for the sake of my fellow peers please we ask of you to not change the grade point average many of us are outraged for your decision. If you can see and put your self in our shoes you will see and learn how hard it is for us students to go from a 2.0 to a 3.0. Consider this many of our students have a C average, and 'it takes a C average for us to join a sport right. Now with you changing the average there's going to be less students to join a sport that they love such as football,soccer,basketball etc. With the changing of the grade average sooner or later no bodies going to not join there favorite sport because its going to be very difficult to get in. So i ask of you for you in behalf of the students don't change the grade average, leave as is.

Sincerely an outraged student)&",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Have you ever wondered why we, American people dont get to choose our electors? I always ask my self that question and never know why. In my opinion i think that the election should be by popular vote by the American citizens. The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair to voters and irrational.

The first reason why the electoral college is absurd is because it is not fair. It has a winner- take- all system in each state. Candidates dont spend time in states that have no chance of winning. Into that, the article ""

The Indefensible Electoral college

"" states ""

State legislatures are currently resposible for choosing the electors

"". So technically they give us a category of presidents to choose from!

The last the second and final reason is it is irrational. Although the founding fathers of the countries establlished the electoral college, that doesn't mean its still valid. There have been many mistakes and disasters in the previous years. In the same article it says ""over sixty percent of the vote would prefer a direct election over the one we have now"". This proves that im not the only one who dissagrees on the electoral college.

It makes sense why people will actually like the electoral college. Considering that it is an easier way for us to vote and takes less time. However, a direct election really gives us the freedom that American people deserve. What is the point of voting for a president when you dont have the freedom to vote for the one you want?

"This picture on the right shows more and more detail as the years go by. It starts to get more and more focused when the cameras improve. This is one of the reasons why it can't be aliens.

As you see, throught the years, the world has devolped better technology. We've made better cameras and have found out a way to make things even more clear. In 1976, the picture appears blurry. It doesnt look focused on it at all. So what I am trying to say is, that this could not have been clear at first and that they didn't know what they were seeing at first. It could have been there the whole time.

The texts states what the picture actually shows. It says, ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West."" This is a landform. Garivn states that it reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho. People have seen this types of landforms on Earth too, and there is no aliens on Earth. they have said it's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa.

In the text, it says that scientists figured it was just another Martin mesa. They even said it was common around that area, Cydonia. The only thing that was different was, that it had shadows around it. That is completly normal for shadows to appear.

According to the research I have learned, I believe that this was not made by aliens. I believe, that this is a landform. There is no scienitifict proof that an alien had decided to make this. There is no actual evidence.      ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Hey there!  So, for this essay, I had to research the effects of inactivity on people's ability to accomplish their goals. And let me tell you, it's not good. Like, at all.

So, first off, when we're not active, our brains start to slow down. It's like, literally, our brains are like, ""Ugh, I'm bored. Can we just take a nap?"" And then we can't focus or think straight. It's like, super hard to get anything done. Plus, our bodies start to feel all lazy and stuff, so we get tired easily. It's like, ugh, I can't even.

But, you know what's even worse? When we're at work or school and we're not active. Like, imagine you're sitting at your desk all day, just staring at a computer screen. It's like, your brain is just, like, ""What's the point of even trying?"" And then you get all grumpy and stuff. And you can't even focus on what you're supposed to be doing. It's like, boo.

So, what can we do about it? Well, we can set aside some free time. Like, I know it sounds weird, but it's actually really important. When we have free time, we can do stuff that makes us happy, like play games or hang out with friends. And it's not just fun and games, though. It actually helps us relax and recharge. It's like, our brains are like, ""Oh, finally, some time to chill."" And then we can come back to our work or school stuff feeling refreshed and ready to go.

But, there are also some downsides to setting aside free time. Like, sometimes we can get so caught up in doing fun stuff that we forget about our work or school stuff. And then we're like, ""Oh no, I didn't finish my homework!"" Or, ""I'm going to be late for work!"" It's like, super stressful.

So, what's the solution? Well, it's actually pretty simple. We just need to find a balance",1,llama2_chat,3
"To Principal TEACHER_NAME:

Cell phones have been in every household for the past couple of years.

They are completely changing not just communication, but ways of life.

I have heard that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy.

The policy right for our school is to not allow students to have phones in school at all because they cause a distraction, could get broken or stolen, and students can cheat easily with cell phones.

Initally, cell phones should not be allowed in school at all times because they cause a distraction.

If teens were allowed to have phones out during free periods and lunch time, almost everybody would be texting and talking on the phone.

With over one hundred people in the lunch room or just fifteen occupants in the library can become really loud.

Others around them may be trying to do work or study for an exam, but it will be difficult with the constant noise of cell phones.

Also, all this speaking and music that can be played on a phone will disturb classrooms nearby.

A teacher giving a lesson in the room next store will have a difficult time raising his or her voice to talk over the chatter close by.

To continue, it is safer to just keep phones off school grounds.

A person can drop his or her cell phone in the cafeteria and have it trampled on by many students walking around.

Phones can also get stolen by others.

Someone might take another student's phone out of jealousy, revenge, a joke, or a different reason.

The person who lost their phone could even go as far as pressing legal charges to the stealer.

Now this all seems like an ample amount of issues just to bring a phone to school, so it's better off left at home.

Next, phones can lead to students cheating.

Picture this: two students have a free period.

One is in the library studying for a big chapter test, and the other is eating lunch in the cafeteria.

The person eating just took the exam his friend is cramming for, so he helps out his buddy by texting him the answers.

The student in the library makes a pneumonic device to remember the multiple choice answers and he cheats on the test by doing so.

Even though the cell phones weren't used in the classroom, they still caused problems and took away from a teenager's education.

"Dear, State Senator,

I think that we should not change the way we vote we should keep the Electoral College. Maybe instead of changing everything we should keep what we have. Most likely everthing will be a total disaster. If we change everything it will all fall under the pressure. We really dont need change in the world today as it is. It will be hard to get up after this big of a fall.

Well what is bad about the Electoral College is that it is unfair for the voters that is doing the voting. Because it is all about the system of winners taking all. Some candidates dont spend time in the states. If they really know that they do not have the chance of winning. They say that this stuff is outdated and irrational. They are thinking of abolishing the Electoral College instead of keeping it.

But on the other hand what is good about it is that it is widely regarded as an anachronism. It is a non-democratic method of selecting a president. But it is not a democratic in a modern sense. But it is good because the people vote for a trusted slate of electors. But the trusted electors vote for the party`s nominee. Even though the Electoral College has a lack of most everything.

Everyone has that one good argument. Everyone calls the Electoral College a disaster factor. It says that the people in America should consider themselves lucky. Well because in the year 2000 a election called fiasco was one of the biggest election crisis in the century. The legislature`s are technically responsible for picking the electors. Well also the electors can defy the will of the people.

Also this thing can be argued. Well about changing and also maybe keeping the Electoral College. Because there is some pro`s and con`s to this situation. There is going to be up`s and down`s when it comes to this topic. There might be many more to come in the near future. This topic is one topic that everyone is arguing about this day in time.

Well thank you for taking your time and reading my essay. This was a good topic to argue about. I hope my responce will help to understand my point of view of things. I really do hope that we do keep what we have going on with the voting thing. I really do not think we should not change anything. So have a good day and once again thank you for taking the time and reading this.                        ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Apple, Samsung, LG, Google Pixel, etc. all these company's make and design smartphones. Most people in the world own smartphones. People use smartphones so much that it can become a distraction. A big distraction is while driving people start using their phones and put themselves and other drivers at risk. Texting and driving is a big distraction putting people in harm's way because people cannot do two things at once and most accidents occur because of texting and driving.

Cell phones can be a big distraction in the world. Most people get addicted to their phones that they can't live without them. People need to have their phones on them all the time. When they get notifications they have to look no matter what they're doing. When they get a notification while driving they get distracted so now they're not focused on the road that puts them and other people in danger. Cell phones distract people from the road which may lead to an accident. Some people think they can multitask by driving and texting but that's not the case.

Multitasking is a hard thing for human beings. Even if you think you are multitasking the human brain can only process things one at a time. While people are texting and driving they are only focus on one thing so they can crash at any moment because they're not focused on the road. This puts everyone in danger. This is why states have put strict laws so that people wouldn't text while driving. This is why texting while driving is a leading cause for car accidents.

When it comes to car accidents, most of them occur because the driver was distracted.

Most likely they were using their phones. It was reported that, "" A distracted driver is a motorist that diverts his or her attention from the road, usually to talk on the cell phone, send a text message or eat food."" As it states most accidents are because of cell phone distraction this is why they made laws to try and stop texting while driving. Right now this is the leading cause for car accidents and we have to try and prevent it from continuing.

Texting and driving should not be permitted anywhere as it distracts the driver putting everyone in danger. All this causes people to die or get severely injured this is why people need to put their phones down for a while and focus on the road. This way we have a safer environment for everyone.

"Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth and is also reffered to as our sister planet. We have sent many probes to Venus, yet many have not survived more than a few hours. Venus may be very close to us compared to other planets in our solar syestem, but it is far different in its characteristics. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author shows how Venus is dangerous but still worthy of studying by giving us evidence and examples about Venus and its features.

The author gives us statistical evidence on how our planet is different from Venus. He explains that its temperature, atmosphere, and its acidic clouds are making the planet uninheritable for humans. The author writes, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planets's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (3) The other spits out many facts that support his claim that exploring Venus is a very dangerous job. 800 degrees Farenheit is very hot and would not eb suitable by a human. In fact, all of these feaures would make it hard for a human to live on Venus. All these points can help prove that Venus is still worthy of studying even though there are many dangers because it should interests scientists and others to find out how these conditions came to be, what could survive in these harmful conditions, and even possibly how to make it possible for humans to live there.

The author also uses examples to support his claim that Venus is inhospitable for humans. Humans have many needs in order to survive on a planet and Venus does not qualify for many. The author writes ""such an environment woud crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to teh deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals."" (3) In this quote the athor is referring to the pressure of the planet inside the atmosphere. If a submarine could not survive the pressure, I doubt a human could either. The author also says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system"" and it has ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This is impreessive beause even probes that are specifically made for going to Venus, cant even survive on Venus. This proves that Venus is very dangerous but still worthy of studying because it challenges scientists to find new ways of making stronger probes and new ways to study this planet that prove effective.

The author uses many peices of statictcal evidence and examples to prove his point that Venus is worthy of studying even considering the dangerous conditions. It is worthy because it has insanely harsh temperature, atmosphere, atmospheric pressure, and other harmful characteristics. Would you want to study Venus considering its deadly differences?",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Making the right choice is easier said than done, but what an unfortunate amount of people don't realize, is that all the help they need to make a better choice, is a simple solution. They just need to talk. Although a simple solution, a sizable amount of people don't even bother to ask others for advice, even when there's enough benefits to fill up an entire essay. Seeking multiple opinions or advice can help someone make a better choice because he or she will acquire advice from different people, learn advice that was earned by experience, and will be able to use advice and opinions from the past.

Conversely, opinions from different people may help an individual make a better choice, for a number of reasons. Firstly, advice from multiple people gives you different perspectives on a matter. Using differing points of view lets you think about a problem in a different way, letting you take a different approach. Varying perspectives may even help you come to a better choice quicker. Not only that, the right choice to a problem almost always requires a diversity in perspectives, but the usefulness of others' advice doesn't stop there. Advice from multiple people also means different opinions. Even if no opinions are satisfactory, advice can be tweaked to one's liking, a combination of some, or compared.

Then, there's the opinions that don't need change. The ones that have been earned from others' experience. These essential opinions help make better choices because they're based on experiences that have actually happened. For obvious reasons, these opinions are reliable, not to mention the person sharing said advice believes that it would help your situation as well. That's not all. Opinions from experience narrows down the choices to make. This can really help making a better choice that much easier. Not only does it show a perfect solution, it helps to make the decision faster, without stressing too much over it.

Finally, a solution that doesn't require asking anyone for help, is remembering advice gained before. This solution also helps to cut down on time to make a better decision, and could amass more advice than if one had asked for opinions from others. This solution doesn't restrict itself to just oneself. Individuals may also look into their friends and family's past. Because friends and family are the closest to a person, one may easily be able to recall events and advice given to close ones.

These are some easy solutions one shouldn't try to miss when faced with a decision. You could learn different points of view, real advice that could be applied to yourself, or learn to remember the past, but in the end, they're all telling the same thing. Something that ""...an unfortunate amount of people don't realize."" Just talk. It's easier than you might think.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Growing up, watching shows that had futurisic characteristics, i have always dreamed of having a car that could drive its self. A car that would go the speedyou would tell it to go and let you sit back relax and let you enjoy yourself. Although i have always wanted one in the future,I realize that they are very dangerous and require a lot of cooperation at some times

The driverless cars could make a great impact on society if people started to obtain them. They use much less gas and not give off as much pollution. For example, the first paragraph states ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" But although i see the many pros that come with the driverless cars, i aslo see the cons. Paragrap seven states ""This means the juman driver must remain alert and be ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. The quote shows that although the cars are technically driverless, if they get in a complicated situation that they can not handle themselves, then the driver must be able to quickly react to change the situation. This would lead to lots of dangerous accidents. For example if the driver falls asleep and the car needs the humans help, the human may not be able to wake up in time befor the problem occurs. Also im guessing that the car would not have much time to alert the driver before a problem or accident occurs. One last thing that is bad about these cars are that if they get into an accident then the driver is fully responsible for them. Why should the non driver be blamed for the vars theat are suppose to be ""driverless.""

Driverless cars can bring many new things to us such as lower gas milage and less polution but overall, the driverless cars are not needed and can cause many problems. The car can get into accidents that humans are not responsible for and require a lot of human assistance which really would make the car ""driverless.""So if the problems could be fixed with the current condition of driverless cars then i would be happy to see them on the road, but until then I think it is much better to use the same cars that we have been using for years.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Concerning your choice on whether to make all students do community service or volunteer. I think you should let each student make their own choice. Many people probably have things to do and people to see, so therefore they won't be able to attend the event. I can understand that you may assign everyone to attend the event because some of us can be lazy. I would prefer to come down and help with the clean-up because it would be the generous thing to do. Being able to clean-up your community is wonderful and you should be proud to do it. Taking care of your surroundings is just like taking care of your home, because it is your home. Sure, i would love to come and pick up trash, waste, and recycle a little too. I wouldn't care what my friends who didn't want to clean-up say i would go and help out my community. There is too much time in a day for you to just sit around and waste it, so get up and help out and show some respect to those who really care. To show elementary students that you should clean your community will make them appreciate this world instead of making it into a litter ball. For example, i would wanna be one of the leaders of a group as a position.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"These summer projects that some schools require students to do should be teacher-designed. If the project is teacher-designed it will challenge the students on what they know and what they might need to learn. Since the projects are teacher-designed you can always ask a teacher for help if needed. Because the projects are designed by teachers, they could also be preparing you for the subject for the next school year. These three points help prove why a teacher-designed project is better than a student-designed one.

The teacher-designed project will challenge the students on topics they would have already learned during the school year. It's a good way of challenging them on what they already know so that they can see what they remember and what they might need to relearn. Some may argue that the students would be too stressed during the summer from the project that they won't really enjoy their summer. However, if they take time and pace themselves the project shouldn't take that much time; since it's based on what they previously learned.

If the projects are teacher-designed you could ask a teacher for help if need, for they would already know the topic of the project. If students have problems or ever get confused they could ask a teacher for assistance. Some may argue that during the summer; teachers won't be willing to help or they might be to busy to be able to do anything. However, most teachers are still reachable through their school email or any other way that you would use to contact them to ask questions.

Because these projects would be teacher-designed, they could also be mentally preparing the students for that subject for the next school year. These projects would be testing the students on new information that they would need to know for the start of the new school year. Some may argue that the teacher-designed projects would be more stressful than it would be useful. However, it would be more helpful to challenge the students on new topics to see where they are at, at comprehending the new topic.

These three points help provide examples on the claim. In conclusion a teacher-designed project would be more resourceful and helpful than a student-designed project.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Ummm... hey there!  So, like, I know this might sound kinda weird, but I think when things go wrong, they can actually be, like, a chance to do your best!  Yeah, I know, it doesn't make sense at first, but hear me out! 

First of all, when things go wrong, you learn from your mistakes.  Like, you might mess up a project or get a bad grade on a test, but if you take the time to reflect on what went wrong, you can figure out how to do better next time.  It's like, you're not gonna keep making the same mistake over and over again, right?  So, even though it's hard to learn from your mistakes, it's important to try your best to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.

Secondly, when things go wrong, you get to show off your problem-solving skills!  Like, you might encounter a problem that you've never faced before, but if you're determined to find a solution, you can use your creativity and resourcefulness to figure it out.  It's like, you get to show everyone that you're not gonna let a little setback hold you back! 

Lastly, when things go wrong, you get to grow as a person!  Like, you might fail at something, but if you don't give up, you can use that experience to become a stronger and more resilient person.  It's like, you're not gonna let one little failure define you, you're gonna keep going and keep trying until you succeed!

"Dear, senator the Electorial College should be riden of. The people do not have much of a vote. We actaully vote for our candidates electors, the defenses of the system is wrong, and the winner-take all system is unfair. The people should make their own decisions and not be fooled about it.

We are told our vote counts. We have been fooled. We do not vote for the president directly. We vote for the state of electors who elect the president. These electors are our candidates electors. The electors could turn the other way and vote for the other candidate. It almost happened in 1960. The Office of the Federal Register states that the Louisiana legislature almost used new electors for the Demeocratic electors who would have opposed John F. Kennedy. He would have not had a popular vote. So, ask yourself, who do we really vote for?

The defenses of sytems is a joke. The most popular vote of a candidate should be who wins. The Office of the Federal Register described a situation in 2000 Al gore won the popular vote, but lost the presidency. It is a shame that this can happen. Now, ask youself, why can we not have the say on who is president?

Candidates do not spend any time in states they think will not win due to the winner-take-all system. Their main focus are on the ""swing"" states. As if we do not matter. The Office of the Federal Register says in the year 2000 campaign seventeen of the states did not see the candidates, and twenty-five of the largest media markets did not see a campaign add at all. Again, think about it and ask yourself, do we really matter?

It is not fair that we are underminded and fooled. we should have a say and not the electors. The people should have the power. The electorial College is outdated and should be riden of. It is our time.                            ",0,persuade_corpus,4

Now that drverless cars are here that can all change. Second example, Many people who are usually tired while driving ccan rely on the car itself to do the driving while they are snoozing, now I know that they still need some human skills to get them going sometimes, but now that technology is advancing that can all be improved in a matter of years. Third and final example, It is more efficiant on the planet than most other cars, in the article it stated that the driverless cars will use half of fuel that regular cars take up. There are electric cars but those discharge very quickly and gasoline cars will damage the planet , now i'm not saying that driverless cars will not run on fuel but they will use half of what other cars do reducing the amount of polluton that is getting spread into the air.

"Modern day technology allows for discovering many new possibilities that were not open in the past. One of these possibilities is the ability for students to attend classes online. This option gives students more choices in how they want to approach school and take classes. As the popularity of online classes increases, many may find themselves wanting to see what taking a virtual course would be like. The ability to not be required to show up at school may seem especially appealing. However, the perks of taking online classes may not necessarily be as desirable as one may think. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because teachers are not able to provide in-person assistance, student performance would see a sharp decline, and the convenience of attending school from home would come at the expense of students' overall health.

Virtual classrooms have no significant advantage over real-life ones. In fact, students would be unable to receive in-person help from instructors. This would negatively impact the atmosphere of the in-person classroom, as there are less students showing up to class and actively contributing to discussions. The presence of an online course would take away from the students' general feeling of unity in their respective classes, resulting in the school community appearing to become more separated. Plus, regardless of whether they teach in a classroom or over a computer, teachers' salaries remain the same. This means the school board will not be able to save money by having instructors teach a virtual course, while instructors become much more limited in their ability to teach because they do not see their students in real life. Some students genuinely require in-person instructors to help explain challenging concepts, and online courses take away that freedom.

Students would like to believe that they would generally do better in online courses compared to normal classes. However, it is extremely likely that students may face a decrease in academic performance when enrolled in a virtual course. The primary reason is that students may be unmotivated to learn on their own. When the initial excitement of taking an online course wears off, students may find themselves struggling to complete their work during their own free time. Without an active in-class instructor to push students to keep studying, students are much more likely to slack off and spend free time enjoying fun activities rather than complete work for an online class. Even the most disciplined students may face their own problems. Students have a lot more going on in their lives than one might think, and in the midst of the chaos they may forget to sign in to their online course every once in a while. In just a few days, online courses can have students drowning in late and/or incomplete assignments, drastically raising stress levels and lowering grades. While the option of enrolling in an online course can be beneficial to some, others may find that these courses significantly lower their academic performance.

Being able to study from the comfort of one's home is a warm and inviting concept. On the other hand, students would find themselves staying in their homes for much longer than is recommended, negatively affecting physical and mental health. When students cannot move around or leave the house during the day, they are more likely to adapt a sedentary lifestyle. When attending school in-person, students are at least able to get some form of exercise traveling from one class to another. Virtual classrooms do not encourage students to become active and form healthy habits, increasing the risk of hypertension or having a heart attack later in life. Additionally, students are unable to see their friends in real life. Many, if not most, of a student's friends are made at school. Staying at home constantly will result in diminished social skills, weak relationships with friends, and a general sense of feeling unhappy or lonely. Overall, an online course load promotes unhealthy/unnatural behavior for growing students and results in unintended consequences.

Technological advancements have allowed students to take classes in ways past students could not. While offering the option of attending classes from home was well-intended, how beneficial it would be to the student still has yet to be decided. The comforts of home and the leniency of the class scheduling would come at the expense of being unable to receive hands-on assistance, a lower level of academic performance, and a decrease in general health. Some students may find themselves thriving in an online atmosphere, but for most students, the cons will outweigh the pros.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I think you should join and participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you like helping others this would be a good thing for you to do. Why would u want to go?

"Yes seeking help from others can help you make better choices, for you can make new friends, make choosing much easier, and others who have gone through the same situation as you can help you make a good choice.

If you ask someone to help you make a choice it can lead to you making a new friend that you can depend on when you need it the most with any situation and give you advice that will help whenever you need it and make you a better person as well.

Also, asking for help from others can making choosing much easier since they have no bias opinion on what you should do and they could choose for you on what to do instead of you making a hard choice you do not have to worry about all that given that someone helped you make choosing easier.

You could ask for an opinion from someone who has been in the same situation as you and they could tell you which choice is the best choice to make that will make everyone happy and no conflict at all.

However, asking for advice from others can make it harder to choose, some people believe that some choices can end frienddhips, and sometimes advice from people who have gone through the same situation can give terrible advice and can lead to you making a bad descion and you regretting your descion.

"Hey there Principal Generic_Name, I would like to say that I personally disagree with you.

I disagree because some students may already have an a extracurricular activity outside of school and because many of the students parents may not have the money to pay for any extracurricular activity.

For one, many students often already have extracurricular activities outside of school that they love to do.

Such as, playing baseball, football, basketball, dancing, and other activities.

So, if all the students have to participate in extracurricular activities after school.

Many students won't be able to do the activities they love during outside of school.

And most importantly, some students parents may not have the money to provide to the school for the extracurricular activities.

Most of the time when you are playing a sport you have to pay for your jersey, cleats, and other things you need to play that sport, and also the dues that come with playing that sport.

But first, you got to consider that many parents are probably struggling with paying the bills, putting clothes on their child back or children, paying for food, and other things that children need.

So, I hope that you put into consideration that before just saying that every student have to do an extracurricular activity after school.

Be sure that every student have everything they need for that activity, everything is alright at home, and other things that will help the student do that extracurricular activity.

If not, I hope you reconsider about any extracurricular activity for all the students.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Business management is a complex field that requires a wide range of skills and knowledge. There are many different types of business management, each with its own unique set of responsibilities and challenges. In this essay, we will explore some of the most common types of business management and discuss the pressures and complexities associated with each. We will also analyze different approaches to managing business operations and reflect on the importance of responsibility and commitment in business management.

One of the most common types of business management is financial management. Financial managers are responsible for managing the financial resources of a business, including budgeting, forecasting, and financial reporting. They must ensure that the business has enough cash flow to cover its expenses and invest in growth opportunities. Financial managers must also be able to analyze financial data and make informed decisions about how to allocate resources.

Another important type of business management is operational management. Operational managers are responsible for ensuring that a business runs smoothly and efficiently. They must manage the day-to-day operations of the business, including production, logistics, and supply chain management. Operational managers must be able to optimize processes and reduce costs while maintaining quality and customer satisfaction.

Marketing management is another important type of business management. Marketing managers are responsible for developing and implementing marketing strategies that will help the business attract and retain customers. They must be able to analyze market trends and consumer behavior and use this information to develop effective marketing campaigns. Marketing managers must also be able to manage budgets and measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.

Human resource management is another important type of business management. Human resource managers are responsible for managing the people within a business, including hiring, training, and performance management. They must ensure that the business has a motivated and productive workforce that is aligned with the company's goals and objectives. Human resource managers must also be able to manage employee relations and address any issues that may arise.

Business managers often face a range of pressures and complexities in their work. These may include financial pressures, such as managing cash flow and meeting financial targets. They may also face operational pressures, such as managing supply chains and meeting production deadlines. Business managers must be able to adapt to changing market conditions and respond quickly to new challenges.

Different approaches to managing business operations can be effective in different situations. For example, some businesses may benefit from a more traditional, hierarchical approach to management,",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Despite growing concern of student debt, students still have the right to pursue any career they deem fit. While working in college can offer financial relief, this should not be the only reason. All students should be aware of the value of work experience and should seek to demonstrate their ability to make the most of their time and effort in any job they secure. 

Before committing to any job, students should consider the following factors: Are they interested in this job, will it offer them the experience they need, how will the job benefit them in the long run? Education should also be a factor, as certain jobs may require more training and qualifications than others. Lastly, student should take their parents' advice on their career journey into account. Parents have attained their wealth of knowledge through life experiences, and their advice can help students to make better informed decisions on their first steps.

Ultimately, the right to continue our education or choose a career should be balanced with the responsibility to ensure that the career path pursued helps us to develop our skills and provides us with meaningful experiences. Working in college and making the most out of these opportunities has the potential to open more doors to further career advancements, enabling students to become independent. In this way, we all have the right to make our own decisions regarding our future, and strive towards success in any way we can.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Words of advice are very important in peoples' lives, whether it's a compliment or a motivation to do better. And in times of trouble or desperation, many people find help from more than one person. Seeking for more advice can help people make better choices in their lives because it helps a person find their mistakes and it can increase a person's confidence in difficult situations.

Finding multiple words of advice can help a person find his or her mistakes. For example, if a student didn't do well on an exam, most people, teacher and peers for example, would encourage the student to study harder for the next exam or retake the exam. However, part of finding advice and telling advice takes empathy and a motivation to succeed. Another example includes a system of elimination method, which means that if more people are noticing a person's mistakes, the more likely it is wrong. To conclude, having more people to point-out a person's mistakes through their advice would not only help the person to fix the problem in the future, but would increase the person's confidence and motivation.

Seeking for advice or a motivation can boost a person's confidence especially when difficult problems arise. For example, renound Basketball player Michael Jordan was one of the greatest players in Basketball. However, in his high-school Basketball years, many scouts and universities did not want to recruit him, until the North Carolina Tar Heels coach went to watch his game. In short, even though many greats have been criticized, they never gave up , and they used criticism as an advice for their motivation.

In conclusion, people should seek advice from more people because it helps make better decisions in life and advice builds a person's motivation and confidence through criticism. Criticism and advice takes an understanding of someone elses life, and helps them acheive greater goals and a greater aspiration, and the first step to a person's goal is to encounter his or her mistakes and learn to fix them. Without anyone to criticize someone's game, without anyone to help someone suceed, and without a second chance, then no one would be able to look out for someone's mistakes and point out a better choice, and no one would then be able to suceed in life.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Not needing anymore cars in the future ? that would be awsome and you could just teleport? that sounds so fun but scary at the same time. this really would change the world a lot.

Another thing would be cars with out people needing to drive on the drivers seat. such as like getting in a taxi, you just tell the car where you would like to go and where its locatced at just like you would to the man in the taxi. exept this time you dont have to pay your car for the distance it drove you just like you would pay a taxi man/woman.

This car would have to be like a ohone in order to drive its self but more technalgy put into it , because it has to have sencers so it will not hit another car that it is in front, side or behind you. and also it will need to have a very very advanced gps that will be have to be updated everytime there would be traffic, road blocks, road floding, construction on the road that is getting fixed, where all the new reaturants that have been just barley been built and open for service. This car need so much things installed to it for it will need to be perfect but not also is it just the car that will probably need to have things installed to it, also we would need to install chips on the stop lights. so there for the car can know when the light is on green to go, yellow to slow down for a stop, and red to atomaticlly stop. it would need to signal the car and give it a message letting it know what color the stop light know so there for it would give the car time to react to what it is instructed to do.

I was thinking, what if we had to install sincers on to or into the road so there for the car will not go off road and it will know what lane it has to stay on or take. then also guss what ? we would have to also maybe install sincers to the speed limit sign to where it will notificate the car how fast it should be going on the road or how fast it should be turnning on a certain road.

Know you see all the stuff we will need to do in order for people to have a car that will drive itself? this will cost a lot of money ! i mean a lot ! because you would have to bulid all of that and install all of that to the whole untied states ! thats a lot of money just for a car that drives itself. its cool but i mean this will only make people lazy to not drive at all.

"People ask for advice from others all the time. Sometimes people go to one person for advice, and at others they go to multiple people for advice. For a couple of different reasons, in order to make the best choice it is better to ask several people for advice rather than just one person.

One of the reasons that asking multiple people for advice can lead someone to making the best choice is when he/she hears several different opinions. Hearing these different opinions will allow he/she to choose which opinion is the best for the given situation. Where as if he/she only went to one person for his/her opinion, it may not be the best possible advice for the situation. That is just one way asking multiple people for advice can lead to the best decision.

Another reason asking several people for their opinions can lead to the best choice made is when someone is looking for advice on a certain topic. When getting advice on a certain topic people want factual information and advice from someone who knows a lot on the topic. The problem is some people know more than others on certain topics. But the more people asked for advice, the more likely someone who is educated on the topic is to share his/her advice. Later whoever was searching for advice on the topic will be able to decide which one is the most factual and which one to actually follow through on in the scenario. That is the second way asking more people for advice can lead to the best choice made.

In the long run it is not smart to only go to one person for his/her opinion. Asking multiple people for their opinions will lead to more factual and correct advises as well as allowing whoever is asking for advice to make the optimal choice possible for the given situation.",0,persuade_corpus,0

"As an eighth-grade student, I have experienced both the advantages and disadvantages of attending classes from home and attending school in person. While online learning provides flexibility and convenience, it also lacks the social interaction and structure that comes with traditional classroom settings.

One of the biggest advantages of attending classes from home is the flexibility it provides. I can attend my classes from the comfort of my own home, which means I can learn at my own pace and on my own schedule. This is especially beneficial for students who have other commitments or who struggle with time management. Additionally, online classes often offer a wider range of courses and programs, which means I can choose from a variety of options that may not be available at my local school.

However, attending classes from home also has its disadvantages. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of social interaction. School is more than just a place to learn, it's also a place to make friends and build relationships. Without the face-to-face interaction that comes with attending classes in person, it can be difficult to form connections with other students and teachers. Additionally, online classes often require a high level of self-discipline and motivation, which can be challenging for some students.

Attending school in person also has its advantages and disadvantages. One of the biggest advantages is the social interaction that comes with attending classes in person. School is a place to meet new people, make friends, and build relationships. Additionally, attending classes in person provides a structured learning environment that can help students stay on track and motivated.

However, attending school in person also has its disadvantages. One of the biggest challenges is the commute. Depending on where I live, I may have to spend several hours commuting to and from school each day. This can be time-consuming and exhausting, especially for students who have other commitments or who struggle with transportation. Additionally, attending classes in person can be expensive, as it often requires purchasing textbooks, supplies, and transportation.

In conclusion, attending classes from home and attending school in person both have their advantages and disadvantages. While online learning provides flexibility and convenience, it lacks the social interaction and structure that comes with traditional classroom settings. Additionally, attending classes in person provides a structured learning environment and social interaction, but can be time-consuming and expensive.

"The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classrom is valuable. The technology would help to see what a student is feeling. If a student is sad, a peer or tecaher can help them get through what they're going through. If a human can't read facial expressions that good, a computer can. Technology is a good source for reading students' emotions.

Technology could help an individual see what another individual is feeling. In the text it states that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" that's what the Facial Action Coding system is there for. If someone can't tell how their peer is feeling, they should use this technology. Computers are smart. Technology can tell how you're feeling. The Facial Action Coding System is a good way to communicate your emotions.

If a student is not in the best mood, a peer or a teacher can help them with what they're going through. ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face,"" humans can't tell what people are going through that wears a neutral face. The Facial Action Coding System reads all of your face muscles and movements. ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar add might follow,"" this tells the audience that computers can tell how you're feeling. Computers can read emotions better than humans.

If a human can't read facial expressions, a computer can. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your muscles not only expressed emotions, but may even help produce them,"" the Facial Action Coding System tells you to smile in a certain way and it may make you happy. An individual may look at another individual and mey think nothing's wrong when there really is something wrong. Computers are capable of uplifting your mood if you're sad. Humans aren't good at reading facial expressions.

Technology that can read your face in classrooms are valuable. You never know what a student is going through. That student or teacher may need somebody to comfort them. You can make somebody happier with this certain technology. Do you think people would be less sad if this technology was used?      ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Hey there!  So, you're asking me to write an essay about why you should hire me for a job position?  Well, I guess I'm up for the challenge! 

First of all, let me tell you that I'm a super hard worker.  I mean, I'm always eager to learn new things and take on new tasks.  I'm like a sponge, soaking up knowledge and skills like a pro!  And I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty, either.  I'm not afraid of a little hard work, no sir! 

But, you know what?  It's not just about being a hard worker.  It's about being a good person, too.  And I know I'm a good person because I'm always respectful to my customers and fellow employees.  I mean, who doesn't love a friendly face and a smile?  It's just good manners, you know? 

And let me tell you, I'm not afraid to go the extra mile.  If a customer has a problem, I'm always willing to listen and help them out.  I don't just do my job, I do it with a smile and a positive attitude.  And that, my friend, is what makes me stand out from the crowd. 

But, wait!  There's more!  I'm also super organized and detail-oriented.  I mean, I can keep track of all those pesky details and make sure everything runs smoothly.  And I'm not afraid of a little chaos, either.  I can handle it like a pro!

"Its valuable to use a technolgy that can read the emotional expressions of a student. I find it important to know how someone really feels and what they may be going through. For an example, many people hide what they truly feel, because of what others think. I have a great friend that really does not express themselves when we go out and hang, she always seems to be bored. The reality is that she has fun and likes the things I like, She may seem like she is bored, but you can tell when she is enjoying herself, she makes a small smile and looks over to the other side when she does not want me to see that she is having fun.

Having Leonardo da Vinci's painting of Mona Lisa is a great way to tell others an expression of all six basic emotions. The way Leonardo used his painting to get every single muscle to go with its roll in each six basic emotional expression of Mona Lisa.

We all have six basic emotions, which are: happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and saddness. It is a surprise knowing when we humans are surprised an expression is shown in our faces, in the third paragraph the author says "" your frontails pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow"" when you're surprise. The most common facial expression is happy. In paragraph 7 it talks about how the instructions above were a happy face instuction, it also includes how their is a difference between a real and a false smile. Us humans have real emotional expressions. Our true expression never lie how we truly feel, as said in paragraph 8 "" faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politican or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

In todays world many people express themselves and many people don't. In the reality many people hide what feel and make a lying expression, with noticeable information on the lying expression. In instance in paragraph 7, with the instuctions of making a smile, Having a false smile is different than a real smile. For example, in paragraph 8 the author talks about the muscle in the smile, "" muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make a crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This tells how a false expression can be noticable and yet use to make a lie.

A technology that can read an expression of a student would be great, so that a teacher may know how a student is feeling and can help or observe. As known many famous people lie about how they feel and we as humans are no different than a celebrity. We all have emotion expressions that we express and falsely express to fool someone. Helping the ones who are sad and angry, fear and disgusted to succed and the ones who feel happy to succed as well.

Having the technology that can read emotion expressions in a classroom of student is valuable. Since most students don't want to express their feeling phiscally. These are my reasons why having a technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable.       ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Everyday the world makes advances in the frield of techonology. But what would the world look like with driverless cars? The results can be only one of two outcomes, a world that is a ittle bit easier or a world of complete chaos. Driverless cars only make for more lawsuit cases, job loss, and dangerous glitches. Yes, the correct, safe technology could eventually be worked out and perfected, but that calls for trial and error, a risk the world should not take. Driverless cars are not something the world is ready for and this will only cause more problems.

An accident in a driverless car has occured, and who is to blame the owner or the manufacturer? Driverless cars are just lawsuits waiting to happen. The owner nor the maufacturer are going to want to take the balme when things go wrong. This then leads to a long drawn out court case of several individuals wasting time and money on something that could have been prevented. Several accidents happen everyday between cars with drivers, but there is already a set way on how to handle these accidents. Driverless cars will have to have a whole new set of rules and regulations. Just as the article states, there will need to be a new set of laws initiated to handle liability. The only problem, no one wants to be liable for wrong doing. But there is a simple solution, forget the driverless car and let the driver do the work.

The next issue with the driverless car is the fact that it will only create job loss. The economy already struggles with job loss as it is and with driverless cars it will only suffer more. The car will of course bring in engineers to work out glitches and fix software, but what about mechanics and taxi drivers? Sergey Brin elaborated on how he felt the driverless car would create a whole new form of public transportation. The mechanics will be replaced by engineers, and only visited every so often, if at all. The taxi system will be jsut about extinct, no taxi driver will be needed because the car will drive itself and give the passenger plenty of warning when needing assistance. This new technology will only destroy what is already working conveniently now.

Finally, all around the world there are struggles with technology. In the case of a driverless car, what happens if the car begins to glitch? There have been several cases in which a company has released a ""perfected"" product only to have it glitch or mess up in the long run. No matter how many test there are, you can never be sure that the car is one hundred percent safe. There is also no promise that a car with a driver is one hundred percent safe either, but at least that person has control. Why should someone trust a car with their life? There are so many things that could go wrong at any moment. There are hackers, glitches, and a whole list of technolgy failing things. The engineers at Berkley have made advances with a magnetic road, but the magnets could easily malfunction at any time. A car with a driver in full control is the best bet, driverless cars are just to risky.

There are so many amazing things the world has done with technology, but a driverless car is just not one of them. There are to many faults that could occur, and people's lives could be the consequences of these faults. With all the hackers and glitches out there, people can harldy trust that their cell phone will work at times, so why would anyone trust a car? A driverless car is a big risk, accidents will happen they happen with drivers behind the wheel. These accidents will only cause huge, drawn out lawsuits. Also a driverless car will take jobs away from the people. Just remember the next time you are asked to support a driverless car say no. Do not let a car make the decision of life or death for you, choose to drive the car yourself.        ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The use of technology is widely used today and is making our world diffrent and more easier everyday. Technoldgy could be used for good things but, also used for bad. But either way we made it and its ours to use. Technology helps us look into many things that are important to us. Technology tells us what the weather is, or whats happening in a city far away. Either way it helps us look deeper in what we wanna know. Would you want to know how someone felt really by one scan of a machine/computure?

There is a new software, latest innovation of Prof. Thomas Huang. He and his colleague are making ways where technology and humans could commuinicate better. They are trying to see how people really feel and are they okay. This technology could be vary valuable, since now a days we use it like crazy. if we had gotten software that could see how we feel maybe students could be better at many things and technology would know how to help us interact with them.""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" paragraph 6, lines 5-8.

We as the users of technology should have our computers know what we want and what we don't want, if we use those and we use Dr. Huang's idea and we get what we want and many providers could be outreached and many providers will get the audience they wnat and what the users of technology will also get what they really want.""so computers need to understand that, too.""paragraph 6, line 11-12. Dr. Huang expresses that technology needs to understand us so we coukld let them knoiw what we want and what the consumer wants.

There is also many peopel who go undiagnosed for what they have. Many people show how they feel or what they are thinking by their expression. People could be depressed, have anxiety, have mnay diffrent conditions and they go undetected. We could use this technology to help out many diffrent people an dwe could use this to better our society and how the people in it really feel.""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" paragraph 5, lines7-8.

Technology that could help us read emotional expression of many people, especially our upcoming youth in classrooms everywhere. It will help us get to know an dteach better than the old ways we use to have back in the day. We must become inventors to make our selves more accesible and more expressive.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have always believed that having a longer school day for high school students would be beneficial. However, after conducting research, I have come to the conclusion that while there are some advantages, there are also potential disadvantages to having a two-hour longer school day.

One of the main advantages of having a longer school day is that it would give students more time to learn the subject material. With more time to study, students would be able to absorb more information and retain it better. This would lead to better grades, which would be beneficial for students in the long run. Additionally, having more time to study would allow students to work at their own pace, which would be particularly beneficial for students who struggle with the material.

Another advantage of having a longer school day is that it would give students more time to participate in extracurricular activities. Many students are interested in participating in sports, music, and other extracurricular activities, but they often struggle to balance their academic and extracurricular responsibilities. A longer school day would give students more time to participate in these activities, which would be beneficial for their social and emotional development.

However, there are also potential disadvantages to having a longer school day. One potential disadvantage is that students may become burned out. With more time to study, students may become overwhelmed and stressed, which could lead to burnout. Additionally, some students may struggle to adjust to the new schedule, which could lead to disruptions in their daily routines.

Another potential disadvantage of having a longer school day is that it could lead to a decrease in the quality of education. If students are not given adequate time to rest and recharge, their cognitive abilities may suffer. This could lead to a decrease in the quality of education, as students may not be able to fully absorb the material.

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to having a longer school day for high school students, there are also potential disadvantages. It is important for schools to carefully consider the pros and cons of having a longer school day and to make a decision that is best for their students. Ultimately, the goal should be to provide students with the best possible education, while also taking into account their social and emotional well-being.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, provided they are used only during lunch, recess, or any other designated time outside of class. By having phones available, students can keep in touch with their parents, say if they need a ride home, or in case of an emergency.

In order to avoid distraction from student phones, teachers should set clear expectations for when and how students are allowed to use their phones. For instance, phones may only be used during breaks or lunchtime only and must remain off and away from sight during class. Teachers should also enforce consequences if rules are broken, such as temporary removal of the device.

On the other hand, students need to take responsibility for their own phones. It should go without saying that they should abide by school policies and not use their phones during class. Also, if there is a policy in place to keep phones away from sight during class, phones should not be used at any time in the hallway, classroom, or any other public area until students are out of class. Students should also be aware that if they are found to be breaking these policies, their phones can be taken away by teachers.

All in all, students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, provided they are used responsibly and only during the times designated by the school. With clear expectations and penalties in place, students and teachers can work together to ensure that the phones stay out of classrooms, and that students remain focused and productive during the school day.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"The Electoral College is a way of deciding the President by having an amount of electors for each state. And the President that gets the most votes wins all [In most states] the electoral votes. Elecoral college is a great way to decide the President because having every one decide the President from popular votes is not fair because most people vote for what they hear from other people and if the others are voting for a President they are going to get more than one vote from one person. so having the Electoral College is the more fair way of deciding the votes.

People that are chosen are more cnoledgable and smarter to vote than people that vote just to say that they voted without looking and knowing why they voted for that President and not for the other. Because in the passage it says ""It is entierly possible that the winner of the electroal vote will not win the national popular votes"" and that suggests the point of this essay.

The Electoral College foucese more on all states than the popular votes. because big states like (Florida, texes, etc) have way more people than other states so if a state has 15 electoral votes and a diffrent state had 11 when the first state has double the amount of people in the second state. so that means that the President has to focuse on all the states so no state feels that their votes don't matter.

"It is true that there are some advantages to pursuing a career at a young age. For example, young people are often full of energy and enthusiasm, and they can take on tasks with a great deal of vigor and determination. Also, starting out a career at a young age can provide a foundation for future success. However, there are also some potential drawbacks to starting work at a young age. For instance, young people may lack the experience and critical thinking skills that come with age, making it difficult for them to effectively plan ahead and make connections. In addition, adolescents can often be easily taken advantage of by those with more experience in the workforce, making it difficult for them to make the best career decisions for themselves. 

Overall, I believe it is not always necessary for students to start a career as teenagers. Instead, young people should seek to find balance between pursuing their interests and furthering their education in order to be prepared for their eventual career. It is important for teenagers to take the time to explore their individual goals and get the most out of their high school experience before taking on the responsibility of a job.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Yes I do feel that kids should do sports but this isnt my choice to make. The principle should not be able to ethier it is against are laws. In this cuntrey we have the right to have a choice and vote, and that cant be taken away.

Now I do feel that kids are not getting out into the world enough. This is because of technolgy, kids dont want to go outside with there friends. kids are staying inside playing video games, and that is a fact. Now a mix of both is great and brings the best of both worlds to are comunity.

People have the right to chose, and if you are taking away this then you are taking away from rights. It is a great idea, but it won't work all of the time, because kids have things to do when they get home. And if they are already playing sports outside of school, how are they going to fit this into there schedule. The school does not know what they do at home so how can they expect them to do homework and everthing else in just one week.

This issue can be fixed, by sending home a letter. This letter will ask the parents if they can make the kids play sports. This will eliminate the issue because parents can say if they play a sport already. And if they already are busy, and cant, then they dont have to do a sport or an activity after school.

All in all this is a great thing and a horrible thing because it does not always work. Kids need the right of choice, it is an essintial right, that we even as adults need.

"Phones & Driving

Texting and driving is a major issue today. Although most people own and operate cell phones daily, there is a time and a place that they should be used, and while driving or operating another vehicle isn't one of them. People should not be able to text and drive because it causes accidents, it is a distraction, and it can seriously injure or even kill you or someone else.

Texting and driving can cause accidents. Many people think they can multitask, which leads them to believe that they can text and drive. This is incredibly dangerous especially since it has been scientifically proven that it is impossible to multitask. ""Trying more than one thing at a time - especially anything potentially dangerous, like texting while driving - seriously compromises our ability to complete the tasks safely and well. Equally important, repeatedly switching back and forth from project to project, like a hummingbird darting from flower to flower and then back to the original flower, can impair our ability to function at our finest."" According to https://health. clevelandclinic. org/science-clear-multitasking-doesnt-work/ .

Texting while driving is also a distraction from driving. This can be very dangerous because if you are distracted while driving you are most likely not driving safely. This can not only put yourself in danger but others as well. Even simply changing the song on your phone can put you in danger. While driving you should be completely focused on the task at hand, driving.

Finally, texting and driving not only puts you and others in danger, it can seriously injure or even kill. There have been countless news stories about people who were texting and driving and they got in an accident and died. We need to prevent this especially since a lot of those people were teens. Teens are especially at risk for this because we have a hard time putting the phone down in class let alone in the car.

In conclusion, I believe we should not be able to text and drive because a lot of people can barely text and walk. Even though owning and operating phones is a daily activity, there is definitely a time and a place for them to be used.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Phones and Driving

Is it hard for you to put your phone down while driving? Hopefully it isn't because there are so many things that could be prevented.

Most of the time, people who text and drive think they can do both things at once.

Previous studies have shown,""In the United States,3328 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes that involved distracted driving in 2012 alone..."". This shows that it's become very common which is absolutely wrong,your keeping you eyes off the road each time you glance over at your phone. As we know, anything could happen during that time you kept your eyes off for a few seconds.

Also a main reason why you shouldn't operate both things at once, is simply because it's illegal in some states. You don't want to be paying a fine much less do jail time. It's definitely not worth you being on your phone. And most definitely not worth your life or the life of others. For example,""A Minnesota woman sent and received 240 texts while driving one morning, before hitting and killing a motorcyclist on a highway exit ramp. she was acquitted of felony criminal vehicular homicide and instead convicted of careless driving,which carries a penalty of a month in jail and $50,000 in restitution"". It's very common for officers to check how long ago you were on your phone before the accident to see if that was what lead to it.

These accidents could be easily avoided, considering the fact that companies have built bluetooth in cars so that if you get a call you can pick up through the car. Or as plain and simple as it sounds just don't pick up the phone at all.

"Students should not have to participate in activities because some students might not have any interests in the activities the school provides them with. Teachers, and parents always tell me ""school comes first"", but the principal is more worried if a student makes practice on time. Now cm not saying activities are bad for students, but why does every student have to participate when they should be more worried about their future. Kids are more worried about missing their clubs than missing the notes that the teacher is providing before the test. Students should not participate in activities because some kids might not have any interests, kids should be more worried about their education than their clubs, and last but not least, kids are missing missing the notes that the teachers provide for the kids so they can pass their test.

Not only does this situation affects students, but it also affects teachers and parents. Most teacher are anxious for kids because they have doubt that the students will not pass their assignments or even their class. Parents are terrified of the school calling them because their kid is not passing. Getting an education should be a kid's top priority because not one dream will be possible without an education. This situation can affect teachers and parents because they both get anxious when their kids are not passing a class, A kid's top priority should be getting an education.

School activities are good when students are still doing good in school. activities should not be in front of education but kids will put it there when teachers are forcing students to take an extracurricular course. Most students only want to learn when they walk into school. But they are being forced to join an activity that has no relevancy. School activities are good when kids are passing, a kids education should always be first, being forced to join an activity is not right.

When I was 13 years old in seventh grade, I was on a basketball team. When I walked into practice my coach called me in to talk about my grades and why I was failing, he didn't care about what I had to say so he cut me from the team. When I walked home my anxiety level went through the roof because I was trying to find a way to bring up my grades before the school year ends. When I told my parents what happened they started panicking and hitting and told me it was way too late to bring my grades up and I might fail. My body felt cold and I was depressed, I begged my teachers for help everyday but they told me that it still would not bring all of my grades up. Because I didn't care about my school work I had bad grades, I had anxiety, and last knowing I couldn't do nothing to bring my grades up gave me depression.

Students should not have to participate in school activities because most kids might not have interests in them. activities can affect a kids grades which can have teachers and parents worried. Kids will put their activity as their top priority when getting their education should be. Students, and the school staff should be more productive with students education. Activities are not a bad idea but forcing kids to join a extracurricular course is not right because that is not what school is about.",0,persuade_corpus,3

I think that Sports is a good decision for the student to participate in because they get to work out,Have fun with thier friends,and meet new people that like the same things as them. Plus when they win in the games they get to spe nd a fun time with their teamates,and can learn how to work as a team and leadership skills.

"Even in the age of modern technology, where we are more informed than ever before, people feel the need to talk to more than one person for advice. We are faced with important choices daily, choices that we can't decide by ourselves. As previously stated, more opinions produce a better solution. Seeking more people's advice is much more helpful as opposed to just one's, because those who still feel uninformed can get a better opinion, receive criticism, and avoid bias.

Often times, you and your friend don't know the answer to something. Whether it be a math problem, or what to cook for dinner. Asking more people for their advice gives you new suggestions, and makes you consider choices that you haven't thought of before. For example, I wanted to get into sports, but my friend and I didn't think there was anything that would suit me. We were certain that we had thought of everything. Fortunately, a classmate recommended ice skating for me, and I have been doing it for several months now. I never thought that I would get into ice skating, yet now I frequently visit the local ice arena with my friends. It's hard to think of every possibility, so a third, fourth, fifth, or even a hundredth opinion, can give you a better solution that you never considered before.

Going back to the chance that two people could still be unsure of their solutions, the two opinions could either clash or agree on the same thing. More opinions will either reassure or criticize an idea, providing important feedback that is crucial to making the best choice possible. In my experience, I have disagreed with my friend on what I should dress up as for Halloween. As non-important as it sounds, I still wanted to make the most beneficial choice. So, I went to more people for advice, and they agreed with my friend's idea. I knew that if many people agreed on something, it was most likely a better choice for me. Overall, criticism is necessary in making a decision, and multiple opinions will surely deliver that to you.

Absolutely no one is completely free of bias, and a single opinion from someone might not always be the most honest one. Bias matters; if your friend said your haircut was nice just to be polite, you have the potential to be walking around with a really bad hairstyle. Or, if a friend told you to vote for a candidate just because they like them, you could end up voting for someone who doesn't fit your criteria. You always want to get advice from someone else, to steer clear of dishonest opinions. In conclusion, multiple opinions give you a higher possibility of eliminating bias, because there's always a chance that the next person will be more honest than the first.

In order to make a better choice, you should always ask for more than one person's opinion. That way, you can get a solution you didn't think of yet. You could receive thoughtful feedback for a solution you're unsure of.

And, you could get very honest advice, which might hurt, but would also be very important in your decision-making. To sum it all up, seeking advice from more than one person helps you make a better choice, by giving solutions you haven't thought of, getting feedback on ideas, and avoiding bias.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I go with using technology to read emotion expressions of students because I find it smart if the teacher or principal wants to know how people feel in a certain classroom or even to test the emotions of teens during a time of stressful events like a big test or Final Exam.

I only support using technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom because It would be a good way to evauluate how students and teachers feel during situations in school classrooms. I believe that I should only be allowed if the student that is being tested approves of it because besides experiments or testing for big tests its none of the schools business. In a middle of a test a evaluator could put a computer near the student testing and get a 3-D model of the face and see all of the 44 major muscles in the face (according to paragraph 3) and see how you feel, during the test you can figure out with the technology if the student that is testing is happy, worried or confused during it all. THe FACS can even help when a teacher is doing a lecture to see how students in a classroom feel about the teachers teaching like if they are bored or confused about what is going on, as it says in paragraph 6 of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile.""

I am all for the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of a student if the student agree's to be a example or test for the Facial Action Coding System. It's a good idea for a classroom atmosphere for testing.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write about the potential benefits and disadvantages of a four-day school week! 🎉

First of all, let's talk about the benefits. If we have a four-day school week, we'll have more time to focus on our studies and extracurricular activities. For example, if we have an extra two hours in the day, we could have more time to work on projects or do homework without feeling rushed. Plus, it'll be easier for students who have part-time jobs or other commitments to balance their schedules. According to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, students who have more time to focus on their studies tend to perform better academically. 📚

But, there are also some potential disadvantages to consider. One of the biggest concerns is that students might not get enough sleep if they're in school for longer periods of time. Sleep is super important for our brains and bodies, and if we don't get enough, we might feel tired and grumpy during the day. Plus, if we're in school longer, we might have less time to spend with our families or do things we enjoy outside of school. 🛋️

Another thing to think about is that extending the school day could be difficult for some families to manage. For example, if parents have to take time off work to take their kids to and from school, it could be hard for them to make ends meet. And, if students have to take public transportation, it could be hard for them to get to and from school safely. According to a report by the National Education Association, some families might not have access to reliable transportation, which could make it hard for them to take advantage of a four-day school week. 🚌

In my opinion, the benefits of a four-day school week outweigh the disadvantages. I think it's important for students to have enough time to focus on their studies and extracurricular activities, and I think it's important for families to have enough time to spend together. However, I also think it's important to make sure that families have access to reliable transportation and don't have to sacrifice too much time with their loved ones",1,llama2_chat,2
"The advantages of limiting car usages is a suggestion idea about car-free cities. Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of movement called ""smart planning.'' The reazon why they are trying to expand this plan is because the use of car in the cities is growing every day like five times more than the usual. Cities are full of of car and you dont have to read these to see that. I know that these is a period of time in which tecnology is what take the first place in are life, and am talking about those new model of car. In one part of the view we can see that those care are very atractive and they dont cause any risk to society. But in the other side I will like to show you what especialist people think the cities full of cars. Experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission from tailpipes. Passenger cars are resposible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emision in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

Let see these in other point of view. Think about your son or your little brother or sisster or just tink about any little baby that is born in those cities full of cars . The greenhouse gas emission is reduced by 50 percent so the other 50 percent that those kids are breathing is just toxic air. Taths why the hospitals are full of people whit pulmonary cancers and asthma. While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. But its basic precepts are being adopted aroun the worl in attempts to make suburbs  more compact and more accessible to public transportation, whith les space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk  away, on a main steet, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Something that also affect the society is the obesity. People depend a lot on their cars and forgot about to walk. It is a simple example but it had cause a lot of death and heart attac in the past two decades. ''All of our  develpment since World War II has been centered on car, and that will have to change,'' said David Goldberg. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoring ''car reduced'' communities, and legislators are starting to act.

It was just an informative essay to let the people know about the adventages of limiting car usages. I hope this essay help you to understand and realized about all risk that cars can cause includind cars accident. The limit car usage will help every body starting with those who accept the Environmental Protection Agency promotion ''car reduced''. You can be part of taking care about the environment, and remember ''How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.

"In the United States, limited human contact due to technology has had many positive effects on our lives. Technology has given elderly people more opportunities to remain healthy and connected with others, while providing a safe space to discuss important topics that may have been difficult to discuss before in person. Similarly, technology has benefited less academically-oriented learners by providing easier and more convenient ways to learn. On a larger scale, technology has successfully saved lives, contributing to a more equal learning environment, and has had an overall positive impact on society's well-being.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1

"Dear Principal,

I understand that you are not very pleased with some of our grades and I know you probably would want us to try harder and to do better, but taking our extra activities is not going to help.

Taking our activities away could even make things worse, it could trigger some students to do even worser because of the fact they have nothing in return. For example, if students have sports or any other extra activity, then they have a reason to have a good grade. I know that most likely you want to take this decision because you want to punish some of us, and that is reasonable but instead of at least having a B average why cant you make that a C average?

In my opinion, i think you should let the students at least have a C average because it can be like a warning to them saying that not only will they be not eligible for sports but that they are also at risk of failing. Some students can't be expected to have straight A' s and B' s because some students may not be good at a specific subject. They could just be having trouble and they really want a another chance. That's why instead of not letting them join other activities you should just provide tutoring for these kids.

Tutoring would be a great help for the students that are at risk of not being eligible for activities. Not only would tutoring give them the chance of being in activities but it would also help them in actually catching up on there work. It would actually bring their grade up and maybe make the subject easier for the student.

Sports, band, choir, and all the other activities is the only thing that kids probably look forward to at school. Don't take this away from them, give them another chance and your help. Sometimes students need a break from all the school work and they rely on all these extra activities and it really shouldn't be taken away from them.

I as a student have straight A' s and B' s and even thought this is not a problem with me I know that if I was one of those students, I would hate to have band and sports taken away from me. I love band, I have been in band for almost 4 years now and I do not want this ever taken away from me. I'm sure I am not the only person that thinks this way, so take it to second thought. Think of the agony you would put these students through. Please Principal, do not do this to us. Its the only thing we have.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student against extending the school day:

Ugh, do we really have to talk about this? I know some people think it's a good idea to extend the school day, but I'm here to tell you why it's not. First of all, let's be real, it's already super long. I mean, I know some schools go until like 4 or 5 pm, but that's just ridiculous. I'm already exhausted by the end of the day, and adding more time to it is just going to make me even more tired.

And don't even get me started on how it limits my free time. I mean, I already have to do homework and stuff after school, but if we have to stay longer, I won't have any time left to do the things I actually want to do. Like, I love playing video games and hanging out with my friends, but if I have to be at school longer, I won't be able to do any of that. It's just not fair.

And let's not forget about how extending the school day makes me hate school even more. I already don't love being there, but if we have to stay longer, it's just going to make me even more miserable. I'll be like, ""Ugh, do I have to be here again tomorrow? Can't we just be done already?"" It's not a good environment to be in, and it's not going to make me learn anything better.

I know some people might say, ""But it will help you learn more!"" But honestly, I don't think so. I mean, I already learn enough during the school day, and adding more time isn't going to make a difference. It's like, I get it, you want me to learn more, but there's only so much you can cram into one day. It's not like I'm going to magically become smarter if we stay in school longer.

So, yeah, I'm definitely against extending the school day. It's just not worth it. I'd much rather have a shorter day and have some time to myself after school.",1,llama2_chat,0
"Limiting car usage will have many advantages. Not only will it reduce pollution ,but it will also incourage a more healthy lifestyle. Also limiting car usage may help ween us off of our dependence on foreign oil. Car usage has caused a lot of problems economically, environmentally, and physically for the United States.

To start off, car usage is very bad for our environment. The number one cause of air pollution in the U.S. is transportation. So, if we found a cleaner and more environmentally-friendly way of transportation that help a lot. One way would be to reduce car usage. It would be much better if once or twice a week people would ride their bike or walk to work or where ever they are going. I understand that some people live to far away from where ever they are going to ride a bike or walk ,but if you carpool with people who are also going to the same place you save on gas money and you will also be helping the environment.

In addition to helping the environment, limiting car usage will also promote a healthier life style. With the united state's obesity rates sky-rocketing we could use all the healthy lifestyle promoting we can get. By limiting car usage we can encourage people to walk and bike to where ever they are going. Which will influence people to add a little excersise into their daily routine.

Along with promoting a healthier lifestyle, limiting car usage can also help the U.S. withone major problem. Over the years the U.S. has had many great presidents,but almost all of them have promised the same thing, that they will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. But nothing has happened. I believe that limiting car usage will help us in reducing the United states' dependence on foreign oil because if we aren't driving our cars as often we won't need as much oil.

In conclusion, the advantages to limiting car usage are that it will reduce pollution, promote a healthier lifestyle, and it will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. So next time you go to drive your car just think, is it really that far?     ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"There are many challenges stated in the article about exploring Venus. In the next paragraph I will write a claim on how well the author supports the idea of studying Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers and an explanation of the evidence to my claim.

In my opinion, I think that the author didn't do a very good job on explaining the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because the author didn't give much evidence that it is about the pursuit being worthy. In the article the author explains a lot about the challenges of exploring Venus like the extremely hot temperatures and the ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,"" but doesn't explain very much about it being a worthy pursuit. The most that is talked about it being a worthy pursuit is getting insight on the planet like getting samples of the sediment on the surface of Venus and possibly getting the history of the Earth-like planet that is in our solar system.

"I disagree with the principal saying that we should have at least one extracurricular activity. It's beacause students struggle with school and forcing them to keep using their brain for no good reason at all. We need time to relax and I also disagree with the principal for other reasins to. It's also more work for teachers. I don't know if even the county board would agree with the principal.

Students would hate this in my opinion. Also the brain has it's own schedule to work. By adding more time to that schedule it could mess up the human body and tire out the brain. Students are here to learn not to participate in extracurricular activities. I know some students would want to participate. So that's why I said it should be a option and not be forced to partcipate so students can get there way. Also if a student is behind in any work at school,forcing the student to participate would put more weight on his back. So in clunclusion to this paragraph I think the students would disagree with the principal.

Teachers work so hard to grade,make test,plan and help all the students. So by making the teachers work more by making them teach the extracurricular activitys would also tire out there brain. Even if they didn't make them teach the activitiys it would stll affect the teachers. When the students brain is tired out it stops listening and it makes the student stop foucusing which makes it harder for the teacher to teach. So in conclusion to this paragraph I also think the teachers would disagree with the principal.

So to finish this off I think the principal is out of its mind and before deciding the principal should consult with the teachers and the students. Sometimes whatever you think is the best for people really could be the exact oppisite.

Also the principal would have to do more work because the principal would somehow have to fit it in our schedule. By doing this it would just make everyones life harder. So in conclusion to this I,maybe the teachers and maybe everyone else wouldn't agree with the prompt.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Performing acts of kindness is a selfless act that can positively impact individuals and society as a whole. It is a way to show compassion and empathy towards others, and it can create a ripple effect that can change the world. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of performing acts of kindness and provide a personal example of how it can positively impact people.

Firstly, performing acts of kindness can improve mental health. Studies have shown that helping others can increase happiness and reduce stress levels. When we help others, we release feel-good hormones such as endorphins and oxytocin, which can improve our mood and overall well-being. Additionally, helping others can give us a sense of purpose and fulfillment, which can be especially beneficial for those who may be struggling with depression or anxiety.

Secondly, performing acts of kindness can strengthen social bonds. When we help others, we create a sense of trust and connection with them. This can lead to stronger relationships and a more cohesive community. For example, if a neighbor is struggling with a difficult task, such as moving or cleaning, offering to help them can create a sense of camaraderie and support. This can lead to a stronger sense of community and a more positive outlook on life.

Finally, performing acts of kindness can have a positive impact on the environment. When we help others, we can encourage them to do the same for others. This can create a chain reaction that can lead to a more sustainable and eco-friendly society. For example, if a friend is struggling to reduce their carbon footprint, offering to help them find ways to do so can encourage them to continue their efforts and inspire others to do the same.

One personal example of the benefits of performing acts of kindness occurred when I witnessed a stranger help a homeless man on the street. The homeless man was sitting on the side of the road, looking cold and hungry. A stranger walked by and saw his situation, and without hesitation, they offered to buy him a meal and give him some money. The homeless man was overwhelmed with gratitude and thanked the stranger profusely.

This act of kindness had a profound impact on both the homeless man and the stranger. The homeless man felt a sense of comfort and security, knowing that someone cared about him and was willing to help. The stranger felt a sense of purpose and fulfill",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"""Hey Mom, I need advice on how to get a job,"" said Generic_Name. ""Well Generic_Name, I would go online or read the paper for jobs and maybe you will find one you like,"" Her mom replied. ""Yeah, I'm going to ask dad for a second opinion because two is better than one,"" Generic_Name said. ""Alright you go do that,"" Said Generic_Name's mom. So, why is more advise better? Getting advise from more than one person is good because you get a better understanding, more experience, and you can make better choices.

Getting a better understanding of what your doing is great because you don't worry. Say your worrying about a test and you go to only your teacher about it and she says ""well just study""and then you get a bad grade, but next time you go to three different teachers and they all give different advise and then you pass. If you go to more than one person you get how they would handle the situation and so now you have exspernce in it. If you don't know what you are getting yourself into than how are you going to be successful. You have a higher chance of being successful of you ask for advise than of you don't. Asking for advise may be hard but it is very much so worth it because you know how to handle that situation when you are in it.

That person might have more experience than you so when you ask them they will know how to over come that situation. Learning about what someone else went through makes you more likely to not go through what they went through. Old people have been through the most so if you need advise you will get a better answer from them. At some point in your life you will need advise whether it be for teaching or how to get out of a bad spot so just ask someone most people are willing to help. If you ask someone it doesn't make you a wuss it makes you smart for knowing how to ask for help when needed.

When you ask someone for help you are less likely to make a dumb disision. If you don't know how to go through something you have a better chance of going through worse things. Better choices equals a better life and no one want a bad life. Mistakes are made but that is how we as humans learn and if someone else made the mistake before us and tell you you won't make the same mistake as they did. Say no one makes a mistake in this world would we really know how to live and how to handle situations? Knowing your mistake and helping others who are going trough the same mistake that you went through is so rewarding and helpful.

Getting advise from more than one person is good because you get a better understanding, more experience, and you can make better choices. When you don't know how to do something you worry and no one likes to worry about anything and getting advise gets rid of worry. If you haven't gone through that situation and someone else has there advise will help you not go through what they went through. Not knowing what your getting yourself into is scary and no one likes to be scared about something they shouldn't be scared about. So next time you need advise with something don't hesitate because you never know what the future may hold for you. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principle,

I have wrote this letter to discuss with you about cell phone use in school.

Cell phones should not be aloud in school at all.

Kids should keep their cell phones in their locker and leave them in their for the rest of the day.

I have suggested this to you for the safety of the everyone.

In this letter I will show how dangerous cellular use during school can be.

In middle school bullying is common.

One of the most common forms of bullying is cyber bullying.

You as a principle would discourage bullying to keep the school a happy safe place.

With cell phones aloud in school cyber bullying will be more common.

Other children may take embarrassing and hurtful pictures of others.

Bulling is very serious and sometimes lead to death and with cell phones aloud in school a students life could be put into jeopardy .

Children and teens are put into school so they can grow up to having a successful life.

Cell Phones are a huge distraction to learning.

Even though the cell phones are not aloud in class kids will still use them in class secretly.

In free time kids should be doing something productive to help them learn.

Instead of reading a book a student would be texting.

Cell phones destroy the school's safe learning environment.

At any school the hallways are a dangerous place while students are trying to get from class to class.

Cell Phones would make the hallways hectic.

Students would be texting while running into each other because they are not paying attention to where they are going.

Someone will get hurt and if it is a serious injury the school could suffer from losing money we need.

Cell phones are a safety hazard and should not be aloud during school hours.

Thank you for your time and I hope that you have taken some of things that i said into consideration for the safety of our school.

"Summer Projects should never be student-designed, strictly teacher-designed. Many students wouldnt be able to teach themselves or even complete their own projects. Especially during summer, school is fresh out and for awhile. No student would wanna actually take their time and effort to work on a school project when school's out. Majority of students would be focused on having fun, as well as being on vacation.

First, students will be focused on having fun and enjoying their vacation. Also, summer itself is a vacation for the students, they dont see it as a time to be working on ""school"" projects when school is out. They'll usually find it pointless and a bother to be worrying about a project while it's summer. Which is a main reason on why if any summer projects are given, they should be teacher-designed. Many students wouldnt be able to be trusted with such a task, also depending on their grade level.

Therefore, all projects given out strictly over summer, should be teacher-designed. Students cant teach theirselves something they haven't learned. That's the whole point of the role and title of a teacher, to help the students they oversee. It could work like, teachers giving one final lesson at the end of the year and they assign a project with the information they had just taught. The information taught should have some sort of follow up into their next class for the school year after that summer.

Lastly, even if the projects handed out over summer are teacher-designed, there will still be a small amount of students who dont bother with it. It's a difficult thing to complete and follow through with, nobody wants to have to do a summer project. That small amount of students who dont complete the project, usually are the ones who are the less educated students. Of course the students who do complete the summer project will be the same ones that prosper in life, that small amount of students who dont complete the project usually sink more and more over the years. No matter what that small amount of students cant really be helped or changed, it's more of a work ethic to complete a summer project.

In conclusion, most students will be focused on enjoying their summer vacation and having fun, which means giving out a summer project will be a problem for most. It isn't like nobody will complete it, it;s just something nobody wants to volunteer to do. Which makes teacher-designed projects the better option compared to student-designed. There will definitely be a small amount of students who wont complete the project, its not something that can be typically helped. As said before it's usually the person work ethic, which can conclude with an unfinished project. Also, any given project over summer should be related or relevant to the students upcoming year class.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principle _______,

Cell phones should be allowed in schools, but only during lunch periods or on their free time. Cell phones are a very big distraction for a student, especially if they're a middle or high schooler. Many schools these days don't really care if a student has their cell phone out during class. But having their cell phones out is hurting themselves and their education.

For example, like I said before, cell phones is a huge distraction. Especially for their education. School is for learning, not for talking or texting their best friends. Texting can affect how a student can learn. Instead of paying attention to what the teacher's talking about, they might be paying attention to the plans they'll be doing this weekend. Having your cell phone out during classes is a huge problem, but during lunch periods or their free time isn't that much of a bad idea. For example, maybe a student needs to call their parents to see if they can go over to a friends' house after school. Or they need to see if they'll be getting picked up from practice. Students can do that during their free time, which isn't bad at all.

Secondly, texting can affect a student's grammar, punctuation, vocabulary, and their spelling. It could basically hurt their English education. For example, ""hey. wats up. do u wan2 go 2 my house 2nite"" That sentence there has a major problem! If students get used to texting like that, they might as well get used to writing and typing like it. There were many errors in that sentence. For example, that sentence didn't have any capulization or the correct punctuation. There were many spelling errors and numbers and words do not make a good couple at all. Texting will affect a students' education with how they portray their words and writing them.

Lastly, with the subject of their education, if students have their cell phones out during class, it can cause to cheating. If a quiz or a test is taking place, students can easily whip their phones out of their pockets and text their friends the answers to the problems. That, I think, is totally not acceptable. Also, there are tools on a cell phone that a student can use to cheat on their assignments or tests. They can use their calculator in math when they are not supposed to, or they can use a dictionary to look up a word or definition when a calculator is not needed. A cell phone will not also affect their education, but it can help cheat with it also.

As a result, cell phones are only used during free times, not during school. Communication with friends and family electronically is not appropriate during classes. School is meant for students to learn and get a better education. Although cell phones aren't acceptable during classes, they can give a student in much use in case of an emergency. All in all, cell phones and school are two different things that should not be combined together. It can hurt a students' education such as cheating, as a distraction, and with their grammar, spelling, punctuation, and vocabulary. Cell phones should not be allowed in use during classes but only during a students' lunch period and their free times.

"Imagine the World with driverless cars. Is creating driverless cars too expensive? How many mph will the driverless car be able to go? If technology fails and causes an accident, who will be responsable? The driver or the manufacture? Making driverless cars is not a good idea for the future.

Are driverless cars too expensive? Driverless cars would be too expensive to keep developing. Driverless cars would need a lot of technology for the roads and the car, and to create every piece of technology for each car would be expensive. In paragrah 3 the article stated ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but the required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" If driverless cars worked well on smart-roads, will they work the same way on regular roads?

If the car is driverless, how many miles mer hour will the car be able to go? The auther states in paragrah 7 ""Ther car can handle driving functions at speeds up tp 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Will only going 25 mph slow up traffic? Slowing up traffic will interrupt the drivers daily life. The driver will have to begin leaving the house early so they will not get caught in traffic an so, they can make it on time, considering the car will only be going 25 miles mph. If the driver has to keep their hands on the wheel, is that really a driverless car?

Will making driverless cars change traffic laws? ""Traffic laws are written with the assumtion that the only safer cars has a human driver in control at all times."" If manufacturs create driverless, who is driving? The person behind the wheel or the car? If a persom gets into an accident no one will know who to blame, new laws will have to be created.

"I agree with the principal's decision to have students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons are it will help students make friends and get to know each other better, students will learn how to work with others better, and it will help keep kids out of trouble by keeping them occupied. These benefits will make students happy, and help the well being of them in school and outside of school. Students will have a group to fit in with at school and people to support them when they are struggling.

It will help students make friends and get to know each other better which can make students feel more comfortable at school especially for people that just moved to the school and are new. The school will also be a better place with more friendships and with more familiarization between people throughout the school. Whether or not students already have lots of friends, they will still be able to make more friends or develop friendships. The school will have more positive relationships between students.

Students will learn how to work with others better. That will help when a student has to work with people they don't know well or maybe even don't like. Students will have to work with new people when they have a job and work on other group projects. Students will probably get better grades on group projects when they know how to work well with each other and divide up the work. They might even become happy to work on group projects in school. The teachers also won't need to teach students how to work well with each other, which is one less thing to teach.

It will help keep kids out of trouble by keeping them occupied. Some students probably get bored at home after school and decide to cause trouble to pass the time and keep themselves entertained, but that is less likely to happen when they are engaged in an extracurricular activity. Students might decide that they don't have to cause trouble anymore when they are happy with the extracurricular activity they are involved in. Students that cause trouble can learn better behaviors the more they are working together with other people.

Students will be better at creating friendships when they meet new people, they will be able to have good people skills after working with different people, and more kids will avoid bad behaviors from getting bored. Extracurricular activities will help students later in life with things like college and jobs, when having good people skills will be critical. Overall students will learn how to be better people, have more joy in their lives, and will have more success in life with extracurricular activities. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The quote from the essay serves to illustrate the huge importance of examples and money in influencing others. For instance, in the essay the author cites the example of a group of people who decided to raise funds for charity. Despite their genuine cause and strong motivation, they had a hard time enticing people to donate to their cause. However, when they offered small rewards such as chocolates and movie tickets, individuals decided to contribute, proving that offers of money can indeed be an effective way to get people to act. Both using an example and offering money to the public allowed them to influence others and garner support for their cause. This example perfectly highlights the quote's notion that examples and money are the only influences on others.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Dear Principal,

I feel that it would be wrong if you passed this policy. Some of the sport players are not that smart but if they try they will get a B or C. I think that if they get a D or under they should not be able to play. Some of the sports take up a lot of time for the players have less time to study or do homework. Some sports make you work hard so it gives them a good work ethic and not to quit. For some lower grade kids it good for them to make friends, sports help that a lot. Some kids are just not good a school work but they try and a C is average why do kids have to be above average to play a sport. Different kids are good at different thing so why punish the kids at the thing they a good at, since there not good at another thing. Sports are good since they make people fit, if you took that away from not smart kids then they could become stupid and fat would not be fair.

"People are planning to make driverless cars thanks to thee technology we now have. However, how are you going to teach your children how to drive when these cars come out? How are they going to get their license if they don't know how to drive? Lets not forget that technology can also malfunction at any time.

People have been talking about creating driverless cars and have those be the cars of the future. Right now there are many teenagers learning how to drive. They want to be able to pass the test to get their permit/license. If the cars were to come in now, there would be no point in teaching them how to drive if the cars do it for them. There is a small point while driving where the driver actually has to drive themselves, but that would be hardly ever depending on the situation.

Money is also another situation on our hands. These cars aren't just made of scrap. They need the high-end technology that the car would need in order for the dream to be accomplished. That technology comes with a price. It stated in the story that there was a device named Radar that was placed on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars itself. That's more than buying a single car that is set and ready for you to buy yourself.

The technology used might be high-end, but it also isn't perfect. There can be a malfunction at any time with the sensors and everything that's mentioned in the text. Technology isn't always a reliable source for everyone. There can always be a glitch, and everything blows over. What would happen if the car were to malfunction, and that was to cause an accident? That definitely wouldn't be a good thing.

These are a few reasons as to describe my position as against driverless cars. People wouldn't be able to learn how to properly drive a car, money doesn't grow from trees in order to help create these cars, and technology isn't our best source when anything can happen to it. Although it may seem cool to have those cars come in the future, not everything is as it seems.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" tries to explain the several complications of sending a mission to Venus. They provide tons of factual evidence about the geography and climate of Venus. They give many good points, but ultimately fail at their task to convince readers that Venus exploration is worth it. Along with a failed point, this author tends to go off on side-tangents that have minimal importance to the story.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is an article about the positives and negatives of trying to land a spacecraft on Venus. He has a decent build-up into his first point while giving more and more small facts about our second planet. Venus is likely the most similar planet to Earth, with its rocky surface, hills, and mountains, but it has much more limiting factors to deter us from traveling there. It has terrible weather in comparison to Earth, with acidic carbon dioxide filling 97% of the atmosphere and with heats of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The authors gives plenty of information about this planet, most of it relevant to the topic at hand, and therefore succeeds in teaching you about Venus.

Even after succeeding in information given, the author fails to promote the idea that travel to Venus is worth all the cons. They write about NASA wanting to know as much as possible about one of our closest neighbors, but don't give enough reasons as to why it's worth it. With acidic atmospheres ripping through machinery, technologies don't stand a chance on the Venusian surface. With the science that we have, the most we can hope for is a jet-like expirience, flying several miles above surface so that the pressure doesn't crush us instantly. Venus is additionally prone to constant volcanoes, earthquakes, and storms deadly enough to take out machinery. Given all this information, it seems like the author is trying to deter us from missions to Venus instead of promoting it, as they planned.

The final point to take into consideration when reading this article is the authors' side-tangents. Multiple times, the author delves into a side-topic as opposed to continuing on with the topic of Venus exploration. They start off the article with two sentences that have no relation to the story, yet confuse readers. The sentences are about Venus' nickname, the ""Evening Star"", and how even though it is a planet, it is still called this. This is completely irrelevant to exploration, as everyone knows it is a planet, and the ""Evening Star"" name is never mentioned again. Later on in the passage, the author rambles on about World War II-age computers and how they functioned properly even before the digital age. Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus.

Overall, this article about Venus is less than ""stellar"". The author attempts to prove why Venus missions are a neccesity, but doesn't quite get their point across. They provide great knowledge and information, despite being off-topic occasionally. This article is full of great facts, but the delivery is off and could have potentially been a better read if the author was on the other side of the argument, which has more proof to back it up. All in all, the author does not support their idea the best.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear

Principal,

Cell phones in schools has been a controversial policy since cell phones became widely used by today's youth. Cell phones should be allowed in school during breaks and free time for the following reasons: students would be able to call for help during an emergency, students would be less likely to use them in class, and because there is no logical reason in not allowing them.

Imagine this scenario: an unknown and man walks into a classroom holding a firearm and says that anybody who yells will be killed. Students with out cell phones available would be unable to call for help in anyway. If the students had cell pones they would be able to quickly text there parents or another trusted person about the situation and ask them to call the police. Cell phones would greatly help averting a possible tragedy like this.

If students were allowed to use cell phones during lunch or passing periods they would be much less likely to do so in class. This is because the majority of students who use phones during class are sending short messages reminding another person of something or are sending messages to their parents telling them to pick them up because they are sick. These messages are usually not very urgent so most students would be glad to wait a few minutes until class is over if it meant they had no risk of getting in trouble.

The most important reason for allowing cell phones in school while students are at lunch or passing period is because there is no logical reason not to allow it. Students would not be able to cheat on tests if they could not use them during class. Although they could ask a student who already took the test what the questions were like they could also just as easily ask them in person.

There is absolutely no benefit to banning cell phones outside of class.

In conclusion students should be allowed to use cell phones during breaks because it could help students reach police during a tragedy, they would be less likely to use phones during class, and there is no reason that students should not be allowed to.

Although this has been a controversial topic for years, this is easily the most logical rule regarding cell phones in school and should be used immediately.

"To whom it may concern,

Recently, I have been informed that students must have a grade B average. I believe that this a positive action for our schools. Doing so will give each and every individual student encouragement and leverage to do better with their academics. It is a shame that students have a grade C average, and something drastic has to be done.

When we represent our school, we would like to show others the best we can be which is not average. Putting this policy into action lets the students know that we will not settle for C's, nor should we. The student body needs a wake-up call, notifying them that in life you will not get the privileges you want if you cannot work to high standards.

This whole idea could change the school for the better. The words ""what if"" come around often, but what if our grade average for the entire school was a B? What if the students absorbed all of the information we gave them and used it to better our world? We are not asking for Einstein or a Lebron James for that matter; We are asking for better than average. Is that too much to bargain for?

If there has been no improvement, then maybe we can negotiate a better solution. We will not settle for anything lower than a grade B- average. Once you get it that low of expectations, students will just slack off and wait till you lower it to a C+ grade average. That is too close to a C average (the average they have now), if you ask me.

In conclusion, I presume that we are doing a fantastic action by allowing only students who have a grade B average or higher to participate in sports or after school activities. Keep up the good work!

"The invention of the car was a revolution in itself, developing a new, faster way to get to far away places. However, the more people use transportation the more it seems to affect our everyday lives in both positive and negative ways. Transportation can cause a lot of pollution which could in later years really affect how people live their lives today, but a new car-free revolution could be just what the world needs to delay that probable outcome.

Pollution comes from all different kinds of things like cars, factories, and even smoking. Right now this is the only world in which is sutible for people to live on and all these things that pollute the air could risk how much longer people get to have it. Andrew Selsky says that in Bogota, Columbia the 7 million citizens have dedicated a day in which no personal car transportation is used. This one day has not only helped reduce the pollution, but also benefit the town in many different ways. Such as new parks and stores have been able to open, sidewalks have been re-paved, rush-hour restictions cutting the traffic down, and also the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. This ""Car-Free Day"" has also reached out into other countries as well and according to Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.""

A businessman named Carlos Arturo Plaza says that the ""Car-Free Day"" in Bogota is, ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Just one day without having to drive and worry about the risks of driving can take a weight of stress off of some peoples' shoulders. In Vauban, Germany there are no residents that own a single car. Elisabeth Rosenthal described the city saying that, ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district..."" Some of the towns residents said that having a car would always have them tense and they were much happier living in a ""no car city"". Having to deal with every day stress is hard enough, but when you have to deal with additional driving stress it can really take a toll on some people.

""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fower cars, driving less and getting fower licenses as each year goes by,"" says Rosenthal. America has long been known as one of the world's prime car cultured countries in the world, but since the peak of miles driven in 2005 these miles have been steadily decrreasing with every year. Studies have shown that there has been a big drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds who get their license. The percentage of young drivers getting their licenses has decreased by 23% between the years 2001 and 2009 in America alone. A decrease in people owning their own vehicles means that there could be a decrease in the pollution that cars burden the earth with every year.

Bogota, Colombia is a great example of a new revolution soon to come. This hopeful revolution will not only decrease pollution, but stress as well. A decrease in the popullation of young people getting their licenses could also greatly affect the way in which the world transports people from place to place. Transportation can cause a lot of pollution which could in later years really affect how people live their lives today, but a new car-free revolution could be just what the world needs to delay that probable outcome.

"Dear Principal,

Students should not be required to perform community service in order to pass a class or grade. Community service should not be a requirement, because community service is only useful if the person does it with enthusiasm. Otherwise, it becomes a chore instead of a personal choice to do the right thing. Also if somebody does, for example, cleaning up the beach as a community service project, they will likely miss trash and litter. This would be due to a lack of enthusiasm, and the person did not really contribute to society. So it is a lose-lose situation to be in, the kids complain that it eats up their time and the job does not get done.

However, a student that CHOSE to perform community service, IS usually getting the job done, and done right. If the same student was REQUIRED to do community service, he would make mistakes and would get the job done, but NOT right. There is many solutions to getting students involved with community service. One, for example, is to give extra credit to those that CHOOSE to do community service. Another possible way is to promote using flyers in hope someone will look at it and say something like ""Hey, this beach really is messy, and I can help"". So there are other options than to REQUIRE community service hours.

Okay, to recap, no community service requirements, because to some kids it will be a ""chore"" and won't get done right. Community service is good, but if it is not required the job will get done right. There are other options than to require community service, such as promoting and extra credit. So you should listen so this letter so doing community service is a win-win situation.

People should ask multiple people for advise because some people are much more wiser. They know what they are doing and know hoe to help out. They can help with making tuff choices for tuff situations. They can also help you on living a fun and safe life. Dont be scared to ask for help.

People might have gone through the same situations as the person in need of help. They can teach them how to prevent bad things happening. How to make life more fun and opened. How to make life interesting and successful and even. How to feel free.

"Imagine you are sitting down in the cafeteria alone because you have no one to talk to, and then you hear about an interesting extracurricular activity so you sign up. That is how most students find something that they really like to do. Extracurricular activities are a way for students to explore there talents and find what they are good at and what they can improve. I believe all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they have something to look forward to, get to make new friends, and get to try something new.

One reason reason students should do an after school activity is because it gives them something to look forward to. Most students agree that school is boring because they learn about stuff that they don't find useful. some students even drop out of school because of those reasons. However, with extracurricular activities you get to do what you want to do after the school day. Instead of people dropping out of school so they can start a music career, they can join a music club after school. Then they can work on both their academic work and perfecting their music talent without dropping out

Another reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they can make friends. Most friends people make at school are through extracurricular activities because everyone there has similar interests. At the beginning of my first year of middle school I auditioned for the middle school musical

Rock of Ages . I didn't have many friends at the beginning of the year, but I made a lot of friends through the musical who I am still friends with now.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they get to try something new. School should be about learning what this is you can do well naturally and what you might need improvement on, and this is exactly what extracurricular activities do. There are different types of activities for different types of students. You cans sign up for the school play, a sport that you like, a club that helps the environment, and countless others. If students didn't sign for an extracurricular activities they wouldn't be able to experience everything that their class mates did and they might regret their decision later.

Extracurricular activities are something every student should do because it lets them try something new, helps them make friends, and it gives them something to look forward to. Some people don't think every student should be forced to do extracurricular activities because it takes time away from students being able to spend time with family or do homework, and they are right. However, even though they will have less time to spend with their family and on homework the students will still be happy because they got to do an extracurricular activity. ",0,persuade_corpus,4

"Dear principal ,

This letter would be to try to inform you about the issue that has been notified . Such as the new ""Phone Policy"" as you know there are two rule's in which you are trying to decide and so I hope this letter can help you decide into making the right choice .

My opinion , about the ""Phone Policy #2 ""

would be that it should be selected . The reason would be because many students often don't pay attention during schools when having a distraction in their hands. Policy #1 does state to let kids use phone's during free times or so and to turn off their phone's during class sessions . Now it's not a bad idea but the problem would be that some students would not just turn their phones off when entering class because some of them don't really follow the rules as you know . Second , of all if students are let to have the freedom into having their phones in free times they can be texting each other the test answers or so . These would obviously be a major issue within School education system . Now if the #2 policy is chosen then students would not have the distraction of checking or playing around with their phones during class times or texting about tests answers or , homework answers . By this happening the students would have the ability of paying attention to their lessons as they are commanded to do .

Many kids take their phones to call their parents for when to pick them up or an emergency . Now if they need a phone for one of those emergencies they can use the office phone where there can be a supervisor that would secure that they are using the phone for a good purpose. As you may know parents send their students to learn and so in some situations this doesn't happen because kids are getting often distracted with their ""Technology! ""

In conclusion , that would be my opion about what policy should be selected for the school . Well thhis only explains my opion about it but at the end the final desciocion is yo

"My thoughts on the "" Facial Action Coding Sytems"" is that it may work but it also may not work cause we can't always count on technology to tell us if it's right or wrong, or true or false. The "" Facial Action Coding System"" is supposed to tell the reader how you feel with percentages on happiness, sadness, madness and even fear and depression.

We dont really need this machine cause it can put out false information to see how you really feel. Say you are actually really happy and you arent sad at all but then you go to the machine and it tells you that you are 70% mad, 15% sad 10% fearful, and 5% happy. That is putting out false information on how you really feel because you feel happy.

When you look at someone you can usually tell how someone is feeling by there facial gestures. We don't need the ""Facial Action Coding System"" to tell us how someone is really feeling and most of the time if you ask how someone is feeling they will tell you they will be straight up with you. They will behappy that someone actually cares enough to know how they feel.

Personally i don't think we need the ""Facial Action Coding System"" because that is a waste of money and research. Why would we do research on something that we can go up to someone and ask them how they are feeling we dont need percentages or anything to wild we just need a simple answer like ""i'm fine how about you?"" or "" I'm good how about yourself?"" or "" I'm fantastic, How are you feeling on this wonderful day?""

I think it is a waste of money to do research on something we can do in person when we ask someone how they are feelig today. You just have to ne polite and nice when you ask someone on how they are feeling. Just cause the "" Facial Action Coding System"" tells you the persentages on how you fell doesnt mean anything because for all we know it can be false and it can produce false information on how you are feeling so to end this off i don't think we need the "" Facial Action Coding System"".",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear principal,

I think we should just have only a C or above to be able to go out for sports or other activities. I think this because if most students have a C then the team will have less people to support the team and if you don't have a lot of people on the team then the less the chance of that sport being able to compete. Also the less the people on the team the less chances of people going out for sports and not being able to do it. If they don't have many people with a B then they won't be able to do different activities or sports that they want to do. Plus the less people on the team the less chance the team will win. If everyone had a C then there wouldn't be anyone to be on the team and if nobody is on the team then the school won't be able to go out and verse other people. If the kids can't verse the less experience they will have for the future when they do get good grades to play sports. If the students have less experience then when they go to collage and join a sport they won't have a clue on how to play. If they don't know how to play then they won't make the team. If they don't make the team then they would be upset and could blame it on the school they went to. If they do that it would make the school look bad. Also the more experience that we have the better we will learn. If students could only have C and up to play they will have a better chance of getting into a good collage and joining a sport and getting to be on the team. Also it wouldn't be fair to the students to not be able to play sports and get a good scholarship to a sports collage and learn even more about the sport then they did when they where in school. Also if the students cant play sports and most people have C then there wont be to many people to go out for the team and then the coaches will barley have a team to have represent the school and hopefully win and put a good name to the school. Then their parents could be proud of them for how good they did on that sport. You should really consider these possibilities for the students future and how it would impact them when they go to collage, get a job, and have a family. I think you should only have people who have D's or below to not be able to play sports, but let the people who have a C and up be able to play sports. Just remember these ideas and how it could impact the future of those students and how they will live the rest of there lives wonder how to play that sport and teach there kid to learn that sport, but they wouldn't be able to do that if you do not change the grades to have them play sports cause of a grade rule that you put up.

"Good afternoon, fellow students. Today, I would like to talk to you about the importance of community service.

Community service is an essential part of our lives. It is the act of helping others and contributing to the well-being of our community. As students, we have a unique opportunity to make a positive impact on the world around us. We can volunteer our time and energy to help clean our school and its surroundings, assist our fellow students with their homework, and discuss the importance of community service with our parents.

By participating in community service, we can make a difference in the lives of those around us. We can help to create a cleaner, safer, and more welcoming environment for everyone. We can also help our fellow students to succeed by providing them with the support they need to complete their homework.

But community service is not just about helping others; it is also about learning valuable skills and developing a sense of responsibility. By volunteering our time, we can gain experience in leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving. We can also learn to manage our time effectively and prioritize our tasks.

Furthermore, community service can help us to build strong relationships with our parents. By discussing the importance of community service with them, we can show them that we are committed to making a positive impact on the world around us. We can also learn from their experiences and gain insight into the challenges they face in their daily lives.

In conclusion, community service is an essential part of our lives as students. By volunteering our time and energy, we can make a positive impact on the world around us. We can also gain valuable skills and develop a sense of responsibility. So, let us all make an effort to participate in community service and make a difference in the lives of those around us.

It really made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs. This is only one reason becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity.

Another reason you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is that you get to see and experience lots of the world. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, on my nine trips, I got to see many parts of Europe and China. The most special parts of my trips were seeing the Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gonola ride in Venice, Italy. When you join the Seaging Cowboys, you will get to see much of the world like I did.

The last reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is it is lots of fun, especially after the animals have been unloaded.

It's not just working with animals, feeding, and watching over them. You have lots of fun playing games like baseball, volleyball, and boxing. You have lots of down time with the long trips there and back, and not having to care for animals on the way home after they are unloaded. It is a lot of fun being a Seagoing Cowboy!

Now are you thinking participating in the Seaging Cowboys program? It is a great opportunity and experience for anyone who wants to join. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys is a great opportunity because, you get to help many people that are in need, see lots of the world and have great experiences, and have lots of fun. You really should join the Seagoing Cowboys. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal ,

I think community service would be wonderful for anyone to do. Community service could really come in handy one day, it could also be fun. There are a lot of reason why I think we should all do community service but I'm only going to name three. The first reason why i think we should take community service is because its very nice, it helps others out with some stuff and also it makes you feel better about yourself. So lets turn this around and get to talking!

Being nice to someone is always the right thing to do, nobody really knows how much that means to someone else if you just do one little nice thing. Community service is always about being nice some of the students thinks its a waste of time, but they don't know what it is until they actually see the peoples faces when we be nice and jump out of our way to make them happy. Its amazing how one person can actually do that.

Helping out others could really be a drag sometimes but when the work is done it looks a lot better. This world would be a lot of a better place if people would just help each other with some little things. For an example: Some lady is getting very old and she needs someone to cut her grass every week. Someone could be so nice enough and just go cut the grass for free and see how she's doing. Helping others and being nice is all in the same concept. We all need to just do it maybe for a week. Trust me if people would realize how much we can help in this world I think we all could do it !

Community service is not only good for them its also good for yourself. Doesn't everyone love the feeling that your a hero ? Well if everyone did a little bit of community service everyone would be a hero everyday! Feeling good about yourself is the best thing about life. But making someone else happy is amazing. Nobody understands how community service could help them but its not only about helping them its about doing the right thing and helping others. Be good to yourself and make yourself proud for once go out and help others.

Its all three in one being nice, helping others and making yourself feel good. And I would truly love to do that with people if you Mr. Principal would allow every student to do so. Its all called common curtsy. Not most people have what we have so if we cleaned, did jobs, painted. Whatever made someone else happy I think I could persuade every other students to help also. Thank you for your time TEACHER_NAME hope to see you there helping out others with us!      ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Cars can be a good thing or a bad thing. They're good in the way that they help you get from point A to point B quicker then you normally would, but overall they're bad for the enviroment. This is why limiting car usage can have many advantages to it. Not only will it help reduce pollution, but it can also help you get closer to people in the community and even the world and overall it makes the world a better safer place.

Limiting car usage helps to reduce pollution in the world. An example of this is Paris banning driving do to smog, yet getting rid of the ban cause eventually the smog cleared up (Source 2). This provides proof that by limiting car usage we can reduce and prevent some pollution. Additionally by limiting we'll be making the world a lot less polluted especially if people were to follow Paris's example and put a temporary ban on cars to reduce pollution. And considering just Paris having and it helping them reduce pollution, it'd be safe to say having a temporary ban on all cars around would have a huge impact on the world  and the pollution.

Something else that would be an advantage of limiting car usage is getting closer to people around the world. The reason being the is fact you and other people would be more obligated to use walking or bikes as a means of transportation. And by doing that you'd be seeing other people more often in turn allowing for more chances to talk to and get to know others. An example to help support this is that (source 3) they say how in Bogota, Columbia they had a car-free day and even though it raining it didn't stop people from participating. They also mention how a guy named Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

Also in limiting car usage it'd make the world a better,safer and more manageable place. To begin with there wouldn't be as much car accidents or danger of being hit by a car. Additonally it would probably make people feel more relaxed and happy. An example to back this up would be when Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,..."".

In conclusion limiting car usage has many advantages to it. From reducing pollution, to getting closer to people around the world, to making the world a safer,better, and more manageable place.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Policy 2

Bringing your cell phone to school is just a stupid thing to do. For some reasons its will get you in trouble if you get caught with it out during class, and you will loose focus on what you are learning or what your doing.

Lots of kids get in trouble for using their cell phone during class . Students are either texting someone or talking to someone on their phones in class. Teachers just take your phone away until the end of the period. So after the period the student can just do it again in the next period. I think teachers should keep it for the rest of the day so they don't do it again.

If you texting someone during a test, quiz, or worksheet you will loose focus on what you are doing. Eventually you will be getting bad grades and then you will be in trouble be your parents for getting the bad grades. Before you know it you'll haft to take your grades over again.

Cell phone lead to alot of trouble so please take my word on reconsidering the school's cell phone policy for it is just a wait of time in the students in our school!",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Giving details and information, I think the author explained well the dangers of Venus. He explained the temperatures and how hot it can get there, how it can melt metal things and that it's just not worth living there. But it is worth exploring as in studying it, the rocks and maybe they can find something that could possibly live there. The author supports the idea of studying by saying in paragraph 8 how ""Venus has value"" and how ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limilted by dangers and doubts but she be expanded to meet the very edges or imagination and innovation.

The author says that it gets over 800 F in Venus, says that it could've been possibly like Earth years ago, where humans can live in. But NASA has to do more studying on rocks and other sediments and onjects on Venus. The author explaines how much carbon dioxide is covering Venus, and I believe carbon dioxide is so good for a planet.

"Cars are a very usable objects in the kind of society that we are living in today. But with great things comes bad things too. The limit of car usage in any places of the world would have an effect on every one . It could be good, it could be bad. But when it comes to the envirenment, limiting car usage can even help prevent certain problems that people don't realy pay attention to. Prolems like pollution and the government wasting money in highways for cars than trying to find safer ways for transportation.

Like many factories, cars give out bad smoke from the pipe under the back of the car. When that smoke goes in the air and get mix with the air, it would create pollution. Now the pollution would create bigger  problems like the rise of the greenhouse gas emission and  it could also create global warming wich could lead to much worse stuff that I would not get into. All you have to know is that global warming could lead to the destruction of the earth.

In France, their government decided to enforce a driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Based on facts cited in source two, the city of paris was near-record pollution. On my personal experiances, I know what car smoke can do to people. One of my uncles died in Haiti because he inhale too much car smoke. It knind of messed up his lungs.

People are suprisinly over the crisis of cars. But apperently the government deosn't realise that, since based on source 1 it stated ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. Bycicles are a much safer way to travel. Though cars are faster, but it is way easier to crash in cars, and bycicles does not release bad smoke that can culminate to pollution .          ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear principal,

I think it is a wonderful idea to have all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME to have to do community service. There are a lot of things we could do to help our community out. We could go around the city and city parks to pick up trash that nasty and lazy people didn't put in the trash can. We could have a babysitting service for single parents who cannot afford to pay for daycare or a babysitter. We could have a club were we go around to old homes and take the old people to places like the zoo or the movies.

You can also use community service as something you have to have an amount of hours to past middle school. Instead of just high school. I believe that if we all take a part of community service we would have less drama on the streets. We could have teams were kids that need help(special ed) could come and have fun without having mean people make fun of them. Every once in a while we could have a game were the money we raise goes to a type of sickness that they are trying to find a cure for.

If we all come together we could come up with a lot of ways to improve the community that involves with helping the community. Some people don't know that if you help the community out every once in a while you fell good inside. If some of these people fell good inside there wouldn't be as much killing as there is. that would be an awesome thing. So I really think that community service should be required.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"From what I've read, I believe that the Face is a natural landform. There are three reasons that I think this, and I'll explain them all in this essay.

My first reason for believing the Face is a natural landform is that if NASA knew anything about aliens or artifacts, then they would probably tell us. In paragraph 5, the author states, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" It's their job, and they would get paid more if they discovered something about aliens.

My next reason is that even if the first photo taken of the Face looked like an alien artifact, the second photo proved that wrong by having a much higher quality.. According to the author in paragraph 11, ""if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were,"" which proves that the Face isn't an alien structure or artifact.

My last reason is that the Face is a mesa, just like the kind we have on Earth. In paragraph 12, the text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West,"" showing how the Face is just a normal landform with strange shadows.

In conclusion, there are probably many other arguments that prove that the Face is just a natural landform, but the reasons above are the most convincing ones I found in this article.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Okay! Here is an essay I came up with based on the prompt you provided:

Self-reliance is a great quality to have, but it's important to recognize when it's time to seek guidance from experts and authorities. Self-reliance means being able to take care of oneself and make decisions without relying on others. While this can be a valuable skill in many areas of life, there are some important matters where it's crucial to seek guidance from those who know more than we do.

First and foremost, experts and authorities have extensive knowledge and experience in their respective fields. Whether it's a doctor diagnosing a medical condition or a financial advisor making investment decisions, these individuals have spent years studying and working in their areas of expertise. They have a deep understanding of the complexities and nuances involved, and can provide valuable insights and recommendations that a self-reliant individual might not consider.

For example, let's say someone is considering a major life change, like switching careers or moving to a new city. While they might feel confident in their ability to make this decision on their own, consulting with a career counselor or a relocation expert could provide them with valuable information and advice that they might not have thought of on their own. These experts can help identify potential pitfalls and opportunities, and provide guidance on how to make the best decision for their specific situation.

Another reason why people who value self-reliance should seek guidance from experts and authorities is that they can save time and energy. Making important decisions can be time-consuming and emotionally draining, especially when it comes to complex issues. By seeking the advice of experts, individuals can avoid the stress and uncertainty of making these decisions on their own, and can instead focus on other areas of their life.

In conclusion, while self-reliance is an important quality, it's not always necessary or advisable to rely solely on one's own judgment when making important decisions. Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can provide valuable insights, save time and energy, and lead to better outcomes. So, the next time you're faced with a major decision, don't be afraid to seek the advice of those who know more than you do.",1,llama2_chat,2
"While there have been presidents that have run without earning the popular vote, it does not mean that the Electoral College is inefficient, bad, or unnecessary.  The Electoral College, chosen by our founding fathers, is a process in which people elect for electors.  Then the electors vote for the president.  Each state gets a certain number of electors, or electoral votes, depending on their population.  This way, no single group of people can sway the voting largely.  Instead, only the state would be effected.  Without a doubt, the Electoral College has been working well for centuries, and I see no good reason to change it.

For starters, it is much easier than a popular vote to decide.  Yes, the chance for a tie is there, but to count each state rather than each and every single vote is much easier nowadays.  Counting such a plurality of votes is already a difficulty, even right here in the Sun Shine State.  Imagine counting all the votes right down to the last one!  Even though a tie is more likely this way, the odds of a tie are so rare, what does it matter?

Another truly great thing is the fact that any president must have appeal to all states, or at least most.  Having the favor in the south and concentrating it there will not give you more votes.  In fact, it is more likely you will not be president if you yeild strongly to any one region.  Doing so may lose you many votes in other areas that may be difficult to recapture.  If a president was for say, leaning towards big old California and Florida, but not going very much for the other states, then yes, he may win many, many votes from California and Florida and possibly win the election, if it was a popular vote.  But this is not the case.  In an electoral votes, winning all votes in a few states is hardly useful.  That, of course, plays majorly into elections, which is a reason why some of your favorite presidential candidates didn't win.

Another great thing I am to mention is loss of plurality.  What if my buddy and I each got only 40% of the votes.  The other guy in Tex. got the other 20%.  Who would win?  In the Electoral College, the Tex. dude may win a few votes in each state, but rarely will he win any.  With the Electoral College, other minor candidates are less likely to screw the whole thing up.

It is true there have been faults.  Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO have all antagonized the Electoral College.  One reason is that electorals do not have to vote for whom ever they chose in the beginning.  If my vote gets some Bob McShnuffle into the electoral voting system, but he votes for someone other than my choice, then there is going to be major pandemonium.  Is it fair that your vote and so many others gets flipped just because Bob McShnuffle was unhappy with that president?  Perhaps, but this does not happen often.  Usually, it does not cause too much of a balance tipping.  But the true problem is the word of the people.  We have so many speakers for us, but they don't always say the right things that we want.  Fortunately, these incidents do not happen all the time.  To fret over such things only offers you more problems and less solutions.  By having an elector, a representative, someone can't say something stupid and pull the whole country down with him.  Instead, this is the best way to address the majority of the people without conflict.

On that happy note, I must mention the electoral college is not perfect.  Nothing is.  But it is easier than popular voting, counts all states and regions, and naturally avoids run-offs.  Of course, its still got its flaws.  But you have to admit that those founding fathers did pretty good.  Arguably, it has been the best way for the presidential election, and it still is...

"Do you think that reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I think that it can be a good idea if used properly because if the system can detect how someone is feeling it can adept to the person emotions and make it more intresting or entertaining for the student. This is good because this will help students stay on task with whatever their doingin class. But the only problem i could see with this is some students probably would not want system knwoing how they feel. This could bother the student even more or maybe the system would not even have an effect on certain student's emotions.

But i belieave it would be good to have something like this for exmaple the passage say's ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. I thinks is a good exaple because he say's if the student is happy of what he is being shown the computer would continue to do similar things to keep the student going. Also if the computer detect's if the student's makes a frown it would continue to change and adept to the student intill he or she shows signs of change or entertainment.

Another supporting detail is that the computer can also recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored. I think this is really important because not all students would learn at the same paste. An if the computer can dectect this and help the student this is really helpful because some students or shy or don't know how to ask for help when confused on something. Having the computer detect when a student is bored is good becuase it could change the way infromations is being brought up and make it more useful and entertaining for student's. This would help them remain on task as well as help them learn even more.

My last reason why i belieave this would be a good choose is the way it can change the students mood. Imagine if a student all day was feeling sad/mad about something during school then they go on the computer and it changes its way of teaching to appeal to the student. This is really good because if that makes the student happier they would most likey but more in the mood for school. An example form the text is that ""(Putting on a happy face""actually works!) A reowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy(feeling someone else's emotional sate) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.

So in conclusion i do belieave that having a system that can read student's emotions is a good idea. I Belieave this because the way it can change so quickly to help a student. As well as it can determine if a reader is bored or if he/she is enterained .Overall i think it would help student's improve as well as stay on task. But this is what i belieave do you think that reading the emotional expressions of a student is a good idea?",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principal,

I think students should be allowed to bring their cell phone and only use it during free times. It is better than not bringing it at all because even when they're not suppose to bring it they still do and get caught. Teens now just like texting and using their cell phone. Cell phone are needed because of an emergency , forgot something, or of other reasons. During free times, students get bored and want to use their cell phone for entertainment. Not bringing their cell phone get people in some trouble because they still bring it. Bringing their phones won't get many students in trouble because they're allow to have it and the population of breaking the rule will be less and less.

"Phones and Driving

I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating vehicle. Its puts innocent lives at risk. It's more likely to cause a wreck. And also is illegal in many states. Cellphones should be put up so everyone can safe while driving.

Being on your cellphone while driving vehicles can put innocent lives at risk. You make decisions to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives around you. For instance, in the passage ""Reason to Stop Texting and Driving"", it says ""Actions of ""answering a text"" or just looking at a text, means that you will selfishly put other people's lives in danger"". The innocent people such as young children, friends, and etc. did nothing wrong to cause you to risk their live due to your poor decision. Its one thing to put your own like in danger, but unfair to risk lives of others.

Texting while driving can most likely cause a big wreck. In the studies of drvivngtest. org, it shows that those who text and drive are 23% more likely to be involved in a car accident. Wrecking your vehicle will cause you to pay car insurance, also pay for the car to get fixed. You basically just risking life and others around you, which will cause you to pay even more insurances. You will have to [pay the price for the mistake of texting and driving.

And also, texting while driving is illegal in many states. In passage ""Reasons to Stop Texting Fines and Driving"" it says ""punishments for texting and driving range depends on what states you live in"". For some states, the fines is $20, however, it can be up to $500. If action of texting and driving get anyone injured, you can end in jail. This is the icing on the cake as to why you shouldn't text and drive.

When driving a vehicle please put your phone AWAY! If you don't want to have to pay for anything or get hurt, it's best to follow rules. We all have to stay safe.         ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"We do not think that the face was created by aliens. Although we do belive that it is just a natural landform that happens to look like a face.

"Dear Principal,

I have heard that many students are arguing on whether community service should be done by the students and i just wanted to share my opinions with you to help your decision.

Community service, i believe, is a great way to help people who need assistants and it helps us become better people. There are many things us as students can do such as: reading to the elderly, babysitting, and picking up litter from the parks or streets but also children like to have time to do fun things.

Children always want to have fun by playing with toys, going to a boiling alley, or going to see a movie but life in my eyes has to have a little responsibility and in what better way than to help other people in community service.

I, as a student, have always done community service because it makes me feel like i have accomplished something important and because i have helped my community in someway while also having fun. So my conclusion to you would be that children should be requested to do community service but not so many hours were it takes the away the fun in life.

"Giving advise is like two ears, you always have to listen. When people ask for advise, they sometimes talk to more than one person. You should always ask for more than one person's opinion, for it's better to hear more than one person's opinion, seeking advise from multiple can help out a lot, and sometime's you may not like the advise that one person is giving you.

To begin with, it's better to hear more than one person's opinion. When somebody is giving you advise you should ask more than one person to hear what they have to say. You cannot just take someone's opinion and run with it because what their telling you might not be right and you could get in trouble for taking their advise. For example if I got in an argument and I ask for my friend's advise and she tell's me to do something bad than I could get in trouble for using her advise when I should have asked multiple people. So asking for more than one person's advise is better so you won't get in trouble.

Also, seeking advise from multiple people can help out a lot. If you need advise you could ask a few friend's that you're not that close to because they may give you good advise and you could build a stronger bond with them. Also if you ask multiple people for advise some might say they same thing and some might say different so you can choose from the one's who are telling you the same thing. For example, if I were asking people for advise and most people are telling me the same thing I would choose the advise that most people are telling me. Hearing multiple people's opinion's can help in different but good ways so you should always ask more than one person's opinion.

Finally, sometimes you may not like the advise that one person is giving you. Some people could give you bad advise or tell you something that's not in the right so you might not like that. If you don't like what one person is telling you could go ask someone else like a friend or a school councilor and they might give you better advise. For example if I was given bad advise I would go ask someone else that I know would give me good advise. If you were given bad advise maybe you should ask multiple people next time.

In conclusion, you should seek multiple peoples opinion's. It could help out a lot with problems that you're going through it could also help if you just need to talk. If you ever get bad advise than you should ask multiple people. You should not just take one person opinion because it might not be something that's good and you could get in trouble in the long for it. So if you ever need advise ask more than one person.            ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Failure is a natural part of life, and it can be a valuable tool for achieving success and personal growth. While it can be difficult to accept and understand, failure can help individuals develop a better life by teaching important lessons and building resilience.

One way that failure can contribute to success is by providing motivation to work harder and smarter. When faced with failure, individuals may become more determined to succeed and may take steps to learn from their mistakes and improve their skills. For example, a student who receives a low grade on a test may be motivated to study harder and prepare better for future exams, ultimately leading to a higher grade and a better understanding of the material.

Another way that failure can contribute to success is by building resilience and a growth mindset. When individuals experience failure, they may become more aware of their weaknesses and more motivated to work on improving them. This can lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and a more positive outlook on life. Additionally, individuals who have experienced failure may be better equipped to handle future challenges and setbacks, as they have already learned how to cope with adversity.

However, failure can also cause a decrease in hope, enthusiasm, and faith. When individuals experience repeated failures, they may become discouraged and lose faith in their ability to succeed. This can lead to a decrease in motivation and a lack of enthusiasm for pursuing new goals. For example, a student who has failed multiple exams may become discouraged and lose interest in studying, leading to a poor academic performance.

Despite this, it is important to note that success does not always come from failing. There are many factors that contribute to success, including hard work, perseverance, and luck. For example, a successful entrepreneur may have had multiple failures before finding success, but they continued to work hard and persevere in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, failure can be a valuable tool for achieving success and personal growth. While it can be difficult to accept and understand, failure can provide motivation, build resilience, and develop a growth mindset. However, it is important to remember that failure is not the only path to success, and that hard work, perseverance, and luck also play a significant role. By embracing failure as an opportunity for growth and learning, individuals can develop a better life and achieve their goals.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"In today's fast-paced world, technology has become an integral part of our lives. One of the most significant changes that technology has brought to education is the ability for students to attend classes from home via online or video conferencing. While some may argue that attending classes in person is the only way to receive a proper education, I believe that this type of learning has numerous benefits that outweigh any potential drawbacks.

First and foremost, online and video conferencing classes allow for greater flexibility in scheduling. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which means they can attend classes at a time that works best for their schedules. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for students who have jobs or other commitments that prevent them from attending classes during traditional school hours. Additionally, this flexibility can help students who have difficulty concentrating in a traditional classroom setting, as they can attend classes from a more comfortable and familiar environment.

Another benefit of online and video conferencing classes is that they allow for greater access to education. Students who live in remote areas or who have difficulty accessing traditional classroom settings can now attend classes from anywhere in the world. This is particularly beneficial for students who live in areas with limited educational resources, as they can now access high-quality education regardless of their location.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to online and video conferencing classes. One of the biggest concerns is that students may struggle to stay motivated and engaged in an online learning environment. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may be more likely to procrastinate or miss classes. Additionally, online and video conferencing classes can be isolating, as students may feel disconnected from their peers and teachers.

Despite these potential drawbacks, I believe that schools should offer online and video conferencing classes as an option. The benefits of greater flexibility and access to education far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Additionally, schools can work to mitigate the potential drawbacks by providing students with the necessary support and resources to stay motivated and engaged in an online learning environment.

In conclusion, online and video conferencing classes offer numerous benefits that make them a valuable option for students. While there are some potential drawbacks to this type of learning, the benefits of greater flexibility and access to education make it a worthwhile investment for schools to offer.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Say your in a dilemma would you want one persons opinion or more? Most people including myself would say more. A lot of people think in different ways and have certain opinions on certain topics. It cant hurt to get a second opinion on something either. In this essay I will explain the benefits of getting more then one persons opinion on the problem.

After all why do you think toothpaste companies say 9/10 dentist recommended the tooth paste? It's because the more dentists that agree with it make it more credible. Same thing with getting advice. Lets say you ask that one dentist that says the toothpaste is bad , now lets say you only asked him. Then you would think its a bad toothpaste and in reality its a good toothpaste, however you didnt ask any of the other dentist and stopped after one person.

My brother and I wanted to play outside, however i wasnt changed yet so I told him I would go change. Before I went to get changed I asked him if it was warm enough to wear shorts and he said yes. I wasnt sure so I asked my mom, she said no because it was gonna be windy. Just to make sure I asked my dad and he said to wear pants because of the wind. They where right if I would have stopped asking after my brother I would have been cold.

We make hundreds of choices everyday. From whether we should hit that snooze button or wake up. These choices we make will make us into who we are. We need to make sure we are making the best choices we can make. Asking multiple people about a topic will not only bring us closer to that person but also help us make good decisions.

So I hope after reading this essay you will know now to ask multiple people when you need advice. The more opinions you here about the topic the more knowledgeable you are about the topic.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Mr. Senator,

It has caught my attention that "" The Electoral College"" may not be the best suit voting system for our nation. The people expect a Democracy were every single vote counts. Unfortunetly that right is being stripped away, for the goverments own good. We go to vote for a fellow canadite, not a slate of electors. Electors in which are not guarenteed to to vote for your desired canidate. The states seem to over look the fact 60% of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind they have now.

Under the electoral college system, we the voters do not vote for president we vote for the electors,based on popular vote we choose the electors that repersent our state, that elect the president for us. The people involoved in the elections are those with political preferences, and it is not fair to strip them of there right to vote directly for the leader of the free world. For example many men and women follow the election when it comes time every four years, to see who is going to be the best head of house, he best comander and cheif, and the best leader of our country. The president should be a person the people respect and trust with everything they have. But unforutnetly the Electoral College does the deciding for us, all the devotion of politics and reaserch for our favorite candidates goes to waste.

In additon the next vaild argument against the electoral college is what many may call the disastor factor. Consider the fact that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors who could always defy the will of the people. For example in the 1960's the Loisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors that oppposed John F. Kennedy. And in the same cercumstance other electors have occasionally refused to vote for there party'd candidate and vote for whom ever they please. Yet perhaps one of the most worrying things is the situation in which the electoral vote becomes a tie. In that case the election would be given to the house of representatives. In which, the state delegations vote for the president and the senate elects the vice president. Beacuse each state only cast one vote, the single represenetive of california represents 35 million people. Hardly able to reflect on the will of the people.

To conclude, the electoral college is unfair, untrustworthy, and bias. This great nation is a democracy, the people choose . Not the representitives of the candidates who do not always express the will of the people. I must agree with my fellow 60% of voters in there desire to iradicate the electoral college.

"I believe students shouldn't have to participate in any extracurricular activity. Here is why I disagree, some students have to go home and take care of a sibling or grandparent, a student may have had a bad day or they might not have time to stay for the activity, and many students already stress enough with school. So why make it worse?

One reason why it shouldn't be necessary is, many students have to take care of their sibling or grandparent. For example, a student might have to go home and make food for a younger sibling because their parents are working and it is their job to care for them. Another example is, a student may have a grandparent that lives with them that is not very mobile or they simply can't take care of themselves.

A Second reason why it shouldn't be necessary is, a student may have had a bad day at school and they probably want to go home but can't. For example, failing a test can be very hard on students sometimes because they know it might affect their grade which could instantly ruin their day. Another example is, some students don't have time because they might have a sport outside of school or they might have a family problem and need to get home once school finishes.

A Third reason why it shouldn't be necessary is, school is very stressful for us students because we are expected to learn everything very quick and to have good grades but sometimes we just need time to relax. Another example is, forcing a student to do an extracurricular activity like a sport or serving on student council can make us start dreading school more than we already do.

These are the reasons why I disagree, students shouldn't have to participate in any extracurricular activity because students have siblings or grandparents to take care of, having a bad day or having no time for after school, and school make students stress a lot. Students have responsibilities and lives out of school we can't forget that.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"In the passage ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", cars are shown to be ""futuristic cars"" , that can run, drive, steer, and basically do everything a normal car would be able to do, except, it is ""driven"" by a computer. Arguments have been shown as some say it is dangerous, and as others say it is a good thing. These cars are, i believe, a bad thing, becuase cars are not safe at all to be automatically driven by themsleves. A human, is the safest and most effective way possible, to drive a car, not driven by a computer created so it makes driving ""fun"" or ""safer"". In fact, this is a very dangerous act, that should not be invented.

Evidence and details from the passage, in paragraph 9, it states that ""most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."", and this is saying, that, basically, a computer, or automatic self controlled car is not safe to drive, and that the safest way to drive a car is to have an alert human behind the wheel driving. I highly agree with this, becuase driving a car is much more safer and effective towards pedestrians, passengers, the driver of the vehicle, and other drivers, unlike an automatic- computer self controlled car, which is not safe or effective at all, and it is actually very dangerous. It also says that the car will be able to detect when it is too close, going too fast, or is about to wreck . As stated in paragraph 7, it states that ""the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."", also, ""they can steeer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to noltify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."", etc....

Futuristic cars ARE NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. at all. simply, becuase, more accidents could occur, drivers are not contolling the car at all, it is all the computer controlling it, even though the car has cameras inside it, watching the driver, making sure they are focused on the road, paragraph 7. This is not only safe and somewhat dangerous in a wya, but is also creepy. Imagine you were inside a computer controlled car that has cameras inside watching you.

Based on the evidence and details from story, it is proven that these cars are both safe and dangerous to drive. So, should we drive these cars, or no? I believe the answer is no, myself. Because, yes these cars are somewhat safe to drive, but they are also very dangerous to drive as well. All of this depends on how the driver and the car respondto certain things while driving thopugh, in way, but is still dangerous and they should not be created or permited fro a driver to drive.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I believe we should be required to do community service. I think its a big deal to us and others. People younger look up to us. It makes them feel that there is a lot of things that they can do. It makes people feel better on the inside. From reading to younger to picking up litter.

By picking up litter we are helping the earth. We are saving the animals and the people. We are helping animals because we are picking up things that can chock them. Or things that they eat but they shouldn't. We are helping people because its saving our earth. That produces more for us by us helping. If we helped we would have less things we would have to kill for.

We are also showing younger kids that taking a part in things like this is good. Even if it is reading to younger kids maybe that would encourage you to do more and you would want to make a big difference and you begin to take on more challenges. Then you start doing more and more. Kids would also like that other people care for them and they would like the fact that we want to help out.

People that think of it just as taking away there free time would learn a lot from the experience. They would start to enjoy it just as much as other people did. Also if you think about it, it would go good on a college application.

We should be required to do community service because it makes a very big difference. It makes people wonder a lot more about what else they could do to save the earth.

"I DO NOT think students would benefit from distance learning.

Distance learning isnt for everyone , My personal opinion is that i wouldn't have or want distance learning because I am more of a person that loves to interact with people and having a personal 1 on 1 with my teachers for help. There's a lot of pros and cons to learning at home , a con is that you wont have friends to talk to and socialize , a pro you don't have to rush to get up in the morning to get on the bus or get to class early after every period . Do you think learning at home is for you, lets find out.

The most problem I've heard from home teaching is that there's no socialization and no help. I had a friend that use to get home schooled, me and him talked about it. He said it was hard there wasn't anyone around to show him how to do the work, NO teachers, NO students he was struggling while taking some lessons and he had almost no friends to socialize with he was home all the time. Also, Video conferencing doesn't show students that they can learn from it, although It feels like you next to the teacher but people tempt to doze off or fall as sleep or not even do their work , I would love to have a teacher next to me showing me how i can do math or help use write an essay. But there are, also; some people that like getting home schooled, have getting been home schooled since they were a little boy or girl, the pros about distance learning is that you can sleep in, not worry about having to wake up at 5:30 in the morning or worrying about getting to class late . There's students that are use to it and can do individual work on their own. Having individual working skills is hard, having to not need help, everyone needs help in their at least once. Everyone hits a milestone in their life where they fall and need help to get back up. But being able to stay home feels great starting a lesson when every you have time, waking up at any time, as much as that sounds nice and fun I wouldnt want distance learning, Because going to school and being able to talk to friends and teacher is nice and easier than taking an online class.

Getting home school or taking an online class isn't easy. I wouldn't like to talk to a person on a computer or showing my work through a camera and not being able to correct it right after or show your teacher so they can correct it. It's the best staying home and taking classes online because to time limit to get up in the morning and you don't have to worry about needing to get to class early , I still haven't whether it's best to stay home or not. Having friend and teachers that can help is nice and fun and you can socialize a lot . Also staying home to do your work and relax sounds nice but it's still not the best. I rather come to school and socialize rather than staying home. Now, ask your self would you rather be at least or be home schooled/ Distance learning?",0,persuade_corpus,2
"People often take advice from their family members in order to shape their character. The family can become a primary source of positive influence during a person's formative years, providing an important framework for building important character traits such as compassion, communication, dependability, honesty, and self-confidence. Though a family can be invaluable in developing a strong set of moral values, it is important to remember that individuals must ultimately take ownership of their own character. Our character is shaped not only by the advice we take from those around us, but also from those we interact with on a day to day basis. From our fellow students to our co-workers, everyone has an impact on our character. 

Having a bad character can have serious consequences. It can lead to broken relationships, blocks on professional advancement, and loopholes in our moral compass. It is important to recognize the various influences on our character and to take ownership of our own thoughts and values. We must be mindful of the balance between taking advice from those around us in order to improve our character, while at the same time not allowing the opinions of others to override our own. Ultimately, it is through our own choices that we form our individual character traits and values.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Many schools around the United States offer a multitude of online classes that students can take from home. In matter of fact, these classes can be electives or actual course classes, like English or math class. Furthermore, students having the opportunity to enroll in online classes can be super beneficial in many different ways. For example, students who may have disabilities can take online courses to make school easier for them or students who do after school activities, like sports can take online courses so they will have more time to do homework or complete other classwork. Even though many people would agree that taking online classes is beneficial, others believe that it isn't beneficial at all.

First off, the majority of schools around the United States all have students who may have a disability. Unfortunately, for some of these students with disabilities, it may be hard for them get up on their own or even leave their houses. For these students to have the opportunity to enroll in online classes that their school offers, this can be greatly beneficial for them in a lot of ways. For example, these students won't have to worry about falling behind in school or missing anything important. Also by taking classes at home, will help them still get the right education they need in order to be successful in school, so they won't miss out due to their circumstances.

As a matter of fact, I have a personal experience with taking online classes. Personally, it helped me a lot and I really enjoyed taking an online course both my freshman and sophomore year of high school. Furthermore, I am athlete who trains for five hours everyday right after school, and I found it very challenging to juggle between student life and athlete life. I knew I had to do something that would help me balance my school work and my practices. Having the opportunity to enroll in an online class, so I would have more time to complete homework and other classwork and still be able to train for my sport was probably the best offer I have ever got and it really benefited me in both student life and athlete life.

Although many people would agree that online classes are very beneficial for students, there are others who would strongly disagree with that for many reasons. To continue, people think that students having the opportunity to take online classes won't help benefit them at all, because students will be distracted at home and won't pay attention in class. Also, others believe that students will cheat their way through the class and won't actually learn anything. Adding on, what these people need to realize is that the majority of students who take online classes take them for a specific reason, and it is mostly to help benefit them in school. In my experience with online classes, it greatly benefited me and many others who did the online class with me.

In conclusion, a lot of schools around the United States offer online classes for students to enroll in. These online courses are offered in a variety of different types of classes. Such as, English, math, and even art classes, that students can take throughout the year. Furthermore, having the opportunity to take these classes can help benefit students who may have disabilities or who are involved in after school sports. Although many people would agree that students having the opportunity to take online classes can be beneficial, there are others who would highly disagree and believe it isn't beneficial at all.  ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"As an 8th grader, I believe that creating a program where older students volunteer to help younger students with their academic studies and participate in recreational activities is a fantastic idea. This program would not only benefit the younger students but also the older students, as they would have the opportunity to develop their leadership and mentoring skills.

Firstly, the program would provide a platform for older students to review notes and study materials with younger students, particularly for important tests such as the SOLs. This would help the younger students feel more confident and prepared for these exams, as they would have the opportunity to receive additional support and guidance from their peers. Additionally, the older students could help the younger students with their homework and assignments, which would not only make their academic life easier but also help them understand the material better.

Furthermore, the program could also include recreational activities such as board games, reading, and sports. These activities would provide a break from the academic routine and allow the students to bond over shared interests. The older students could teach the younger students new games or sports, or even just play together, which would help build their relationships and create a sense of community.

Moreover, the program could also help younger students become better prepared to take their academic studies into higher levels of education. The older students could provide guidance and advice on how to study effectively, time management skills, and how to approach different subjects. They could also share their own experiences of navigating the academic system and the challenges they faced, which would help the younger students feel more prepared and confident.

In conclusion, creating a program where older students volunteer to help younger students with their academic studies and participate in recreational activities is an excellent idea. It would provide a platform for older students to develop their leadership and mentoring skills, while also helping younger students feel more confident and prepared for their academic studies. Overall, I believe that this program would be a valuable addition to our school and would have a positive impact on both the older and younger students.",1,llama2_chat,3
"Dear principal,

I agree with you that we should change the policy to maintaining a B average for being eligible for sports because, if someone has a C average they are just barely passing there classes. This could be a result in after school activities such as sports taking up to much time so that they cant do there homework and turn it in on time. Also a B average proves to not only the staff but to the parents of students participating in after school activities can maintain good grades while doing other things such as sports. Some students might find your reasoning a little bit harsh but, you know what they can deal with it because, if they don't maintain such grades other wise they will not continue on to the next grade with all there friends. Not only does this have a negative side but it also has a positive side. The positive side to this is that when they are not maintaining a B average is that they will have more time after school to finish there homework. Also they wont have to remember to pack there gear up and leaving something they need at practice. Instead they will be focusing more on there grades. so yes i do agree with your decision but, there is also a reason for me to disagree and that is that our students will not be getting there exercise in to keep them healthy. So if you do go threw with your decision than you should also increase the physical education to do more sporting activities and workouts. So yes i do very much indeed agree with you.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"For the average, 21st Century American, technology has vastly changed day to day life. Machines have taken up some of the work in manufacturing goods, Cars are starting to drive themselves, and theres even an app that can deliver a Big Mac to your door in under a half an hour. If society has evolved into a world of technology, why not let that technology change the way our kids learn for the better? Students would be better off with having an option for online education, because it would provide for a more flexible way to learn, a ""Plan - B"" in the case of a long term school closure, and another option to receive an education for children in unfortunate situations.

For some kids, going through the typical 8am to 4pm school day can feel pretty monotonous. Even your average core class tends to have lots of downtime that makes students wonder, ""why am I even here?"" With an online education, students who hate wasting their time are able to move through curriculum at their own pace, and whenever they see fit. No more sitting in a florescent lit room wondering if whether the asbestos or the sheer boredom will kill you first. Instead children will be able to set their own parameters for how to get through the days course load. Online school has the potential to bring efficiency to the forefront of education.

Another issue that becomes for and more relevant by the day is how education in America is supposed to continue in the case of a long term school closure. It has become increasing likely that the United States will end up closing all public schools due to the widespread intensity of the Novel Coronavirus. The virus has already infected around one thousand people in the US and that number is likely to rise exponentially. In the case of a massive school closure, an online option for public education would be a clever way to keep education in America from grinding to a halt. A close to normal way of life for the foreseeable future will almost certainly require an online education.

Finally one issue that an online education could partly remedy is how kids with unfortunate home lives properly receive an education. With the flexibility of online schooling, Older students who happen to live in poverty would be able to have a job during the day to bring money home to their families, While still getting a good education when they are off the clock. An online school would also help children with chronic illnesses or disabilities as students and parents would be able to structure the childs' schooling to fit with the needs of that specific child, resulting in a more personalized and thus more useful education.

While some might argue that online school could stunt the development of social skills for some children, I would make the case that, while online school certainly isnt for everyone, having an option for students to choose the way in which they learn makes the idea of school far more appealing for most students. Online learning provides for an efficient, flexible, and safe way to learn, and every American should have the option to be a part of it.               ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Principal makes kids do extracurricular activities. I sorry but I'm going to disagree on this one because, parents work and most of the activities have after school stuff so parents that don't get off in time can not pick them up from it. Plus students are given home work to do,so if they do there sports and things how are they going to do homework. my third reason is that sports and activities sometimes cost money to get into,like the club would want you to pay dues.

Next is the activities when kids do them it takes there learning time away. Plus the in sports can be hard to get into. And sometimes you have to have certain requirements to play ,and some people can't make those requirements. But theres also a due that people have to pay so thats why some parents don't let there kids play sports.

Finally the conclusion is that the principal should not make kids do sports or join a club ,because it is a hard time for the parents and the kids to do a sport and worry about a different thing. So some school should not make a students do something that they don't want to do. And the last thing I want to say is that you should never force a student to do something that they don't want to do.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because the person could be really down or mad a math problem. Also in the text it said that when a student is confused or bored it can tell that they are so the computer will give them a problem they understand. Plus if a student is having a bad day the computer can detect that so the teacher could ask the student if they need someone to talk to or if he or she needs to go chill out in the health office. the computer can tell that your mad, sad, or felling sick to your stomach because it reads the mucels in your face like when your eyebrows go up from getting suprised or how your cheek bones go up from smiling. Also the computer know the percentages of your feeling the computer can tell you that your 80% happy and that your 10% mad and your 10% bored.

The computer can also tell if you dislike the ad its showing so it wont show anything similar to it but if it shows that you like the ad the computer will put another ad similar to the one you smiled or laughed at. Dr. Huang and his colleague made this kind of computer so that we humans can have better computers and better ways to communicate with each other. So we would know if someone is mad, sad, or glad so we can help them out with what they are going through. But the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. But all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Huang relises that Dr. paul Eckman creator of facial action coding system has classified six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness then associated each with characteristic movments of the facial muscles.

plus the computer can also identify mixed emotions. the computer can also detect a painting of a face like Mona Lisa. Things like this that detect emotions can help schools parnets and friends to know whats going on with the person and so they can help. But one of the good things about it is that the things you see on the computer you like to see will have something similar to the ad or video you watch. Also the things you didnt smile at wont pop up on your screen because it didnt grab your attention. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Some schools require to complete summer projects to make sure students continue to learn over the break.

The pros of when teachers design summer projects they are preping students for the start of the new year and also seeing what students strengths are also, what weakens students. The pros of when students design summer projects are that, they can choose what they want to work on and find something that interests them. That position I am taking in this prompt is, student-designed and here's why.

Yes teachers want to test us on knowledgeable subjects and stories ,but sometimes I believe it is to much on a student not everyone learns the same. Students should be given an equal oppurtunity to do summer projects.

If a student designs the project he or she may actually fin it interesting because, they can do what they want to do instead recieving a designed project from the teacher. Like examples for boys would be different types of sports, all types of cars, marketing, music industry, and many more. For girls it would be cooking, benefits on keeping your hair clean, acting, traveling, and much more. This gives students the oppurtunity to express themselves instead of a teacher thinking that, maybe this is a good topic or that one. Also doing something like this is fair for each student.

As of being a student we also have a lot of activities going on over the summer such as working, sports, traveling to different states, and countries and even more. I think that's another reason why we should design it ourselves. Teachers should also get a break as well because they work all year round so it would make sense for us to do it on our own.

Although teachers can be helpful with coming up with projects and designs. I believe that us as students should be the ones creating and designing our own projects over the summer. It gives us an equal oppurtunity to express are feelings and gives us a voice. That's what I have for you today and I hope I persuaded you enough on why students should design there own summer projects instead of teachers doing it for them.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"This Face from Mars is just a natural landform. It can't be created from aliens because aliens do not exist. Also, no one has ever seen a real alien before. They could just be making this up for the entertainment and attention. The Face even looks like a human head. I can prove that by the evidence that NASA has.

The Face even resembles a human head. There's shadowing that makes the Face a natural landform. The shadowing gives illusion of eyes, a nose, and mouth. According to paragraph 7, On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of web surfers all over the world were waiting for the image to appear on a JPL web site. It revealed that it was a natural landform and not an alien monument.

It may look like the Face was created by aliens but it is really doubtful. There is not that much evidence that it could've been an alien's marking. Perhaps, it could've been the wind and water making rocks collide to form the Face.

I think that you shouldn't change the schools policy about having at least a B average because some people are not good at taking test or they forgot to do their homework. It should be at least a C average because most people would have a C average on their report card. because some where out their in ocean of students their is some one who is really good at sports but has only a C average.

If you want to have more people in the sports then you are going to have to keep the grade the same and not change it. If you want more people to be healthy then you are going to have to lower your standards. There will be people that are going to want to make the grades just to do some thing they like or to get in fit for the beach. I know I would because no one wants to be wherein a bikini or swim trunk when they are chubby. You are going to have to not change the grade standards and keep it the same but making the grades when you just be having fun or working out just doing of those things are good because then everyone will be healthy. And the future of America wont have a lot of obese people.

"Most people make good choices, but when they do not, some people seek for advice, while others continue to make bad choices. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Seeking out multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, for it influence them to do better, , and many people most likely have experience.

To begin with, humans will follow anything if they are influenced by it. In this time and age, lots of human's opinions matters to others. For example, Generic_Name made a really bad choice, and asked her friend for help. Her friend gave there opinion to her and Generic_Name is now making better choices.

Also, people like to get different intakes on things. They wanna see what other people think, and how they would do it. Just one person's advice might not be enough. For instance, Generic_Name got a F on her test, and chose not to tell her father. She asked Generic_Name and Generic_Name what she should do, Generic_Name said, ""tell your father, for he will help you, and maybe even find a tutor for you."" While Generic_Name said, ""do not tell your father, for you will get punished for your bad grade."" Generic_Name did what Generic_Name told her, and told her father. To her surprise he was not mad at all and found her a tutor.

Furthermore, asking a person with experience will help you out a lot. They will help you stay away from what terrible things could happen. The quote from a commercial, ""we know a thing or two, because we have seen a thing or two,"" is very valid, for someone who has knowledge on the choices you have made, will try to shift you on the right path. For example, my uncle does not have a job, and did not pay his rent for three months. He asked my mother for advice, and she said, ""I was in this predicament last year, and I found a decent paying job to help pay for my rent,"" so he took her advice and looked for a job, and once he found one he was well on his way to pay his rent.

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice will make life easier. It will help in the long run, and also help make better decisions. Different opinions is not always such a bad thing; receiving advice from many people will increase your knowledge. ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principle,

I do think that all students should be required to perform community service. I feel strongly this way because it helps make our community a better environment and a more friendly place to live. Also, by doing this, it would decrease the obesity rate in children because instead of playing video games, watching TV, surfing the internet, texting, or even reading, the children would be helping their environment and staying active. By doing so, you are also keeping people more healthy and providing this new way of life (for some people) to be a fun project- depending on what the service is. But even if this service is not pleasant, the students are still giving back to their community and staying active- two very important things in life! If they develop this healthy and caring lifestyle now as children, chances are more than likely that as adults they will still be healthy and caring. Besides this, it is also making a change in the world- no matter how big or small of an impact it makes right now, in the big scheme of things, it will make a change in someone's life; whether that life is human, animal or nature. Life is a valuable thing and people shouldn't waste it wanting this, that, and more; But rather giving back to the community.

This is why I think that all students should be required to perform community service.

Thank you for reading my letter, I think that community service being required would be an excellent choice!

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the benefits of determination and effort in achieving goals as an average 8th grade student:

Determination and effort are two of the most important qualities that can help you achieve your goals. Without them, it's easy to give up when things get tough or lose motivation along the way. But with these qualities, you can push through obstacles and reach your goals no matter how difficult they may seem.

First of all, determination helps you stay focused and motivated. When you're determined to achieve something, you're more likely to put in the effort required to make it happen. You'll be more likely to stay up late studying for a test, or spend extra time practicing a skill until you get it right. And even when things get tough, you'll be more likely to keep going because you know that the end result is worth it.

Another benefit of determination is that it helps you build resilience. When you face obstacles and setbacks, determination can help you bounce back and keep going. You'll learn to view challenges as opportunities to grow and improve, rather than as roadblocks to your success. And the more you practice this mindset, the easier it will become.

Finally, determination and effort can help you develop a growth mindset. When you're determined to achieve something, you're more likely to embrace challenges and view them as opportunities to learn and grow. You'll be more likely to take risks and try new things, which can help you develop new skills and abilities. And the more you practice this mindset, the more confident you'll become in your ability to achieve your goals.

In conclusion, determination and effort are essential for achieving your goals. They can help you stay focused and motivated, build resilience, and develop a growth mindset. So the next time you're facing a challenge or setting a goal, remember the importance of determination and effort. With these qualities, you can overcome any obstacle and achieve great things.",1,llama2_chat,3
"Studying a planet called Venus is worthy pursuit but it is dengrous. As we have seen in the paragraph exploring Venus can teach us alot of things and there is alot of things that we can learn in Venus like if there is a life in there or if we can grow something there but no man have put his foot on it because it is too dengrous and too hard to go over there.

As we seen in the first paragraph Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" because it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is also known as Earth's ""twin"" since it is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Venus is sometimes right around the corner and humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each pervious mission is no man which mean just airplane or robot because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, that is the reason the no man have ever step on it. For others reason it is too hot even though Mercury is closer to our sun. The averange on the planet surface is 800 degrees which can kill us and it has greater pressuer than earth. It is 90 times greater than earth. The others reason is that it has powerful earthquakes,erupting, and frequent lightning steikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. To get over there NASA is trying to make thing that can land on the planet and stay for a very long time, so that they can explore.

So alot of our people are trying to go to Venus but it is challenging. They are trying and become stronger. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited b dangers and adoubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I agree with NASA that the face was not made my aliens, and that it is a natural monument. My reasons are because the shadows are what makes it a face. Another reason is because you can really ress it unless there are shadows and your rihg tover it. My last reason is that Mars Global Surveyor Cyldonia took pictures of the Face and proved that it is natural.

The shadows give is it's face because there is bumps on mars, so that when shadows go a certain direction, it casts shadows and makes it look like a human face on Mars. In the article it says "" A few days late NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...whihc resembles a human head.. formed by shadows giving the illision of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The author reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and atrract attention to Mars."" This goes on to prove my next point.

Marc Global Surveyor Cyldonia has taken better picture of what they so call ""the Face"" on Mars.

It says

"" And so on April 5,1998, when Marz Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) team snapped a picture tem time sharper than the original Viking photos. THousands of anxious web surfer were waiting when the image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This goes to show that it was not formed by aliens and it was not created there on purpose.

My last reason is that you can really see it unless there is a shadow or you look at it at a exact angle. The article proved this by saying this "" Neerthe less, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enought for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degees to center the Face in the feild view,"" said Garvin. ""Malin's team caputred an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoltion."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meter, compared to 43 meter per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This is proving that with a better camera and a better view that it was naturally made and you have to look at it from certain angles to see the face.

Yes, I agree with NASA that ""the Face"" is nothing but a natural landform, and not something created by life on a different planet. My reasons being the shadows are the only thing that gives it it's face, Mars Global Surveyor took better pictures of the landform, and you can't really see it unless you look from a certain agngle or direction. The momument is VERY natual in my eyes. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"If you could buy a car that could drive you around, with you not having to do anything, would you buy it? Personally, I would not. There are to many things that could go wrong. We all know that technology can break down at times. Even our computers break down for no reason at times. So why let a car, that could end your life in a split second, drive you around? I wouldn't want to take that risk.

In the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" they explain that even at times the driver has to take over. They said, ""the cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" What if, one time, the car did not notify the driver or the driver falls asleep? This could end the drivers life and someone else's. Yes, in the passage they state ""the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" But, I know plenty of people, mostly teenagers, that would disconnect the wheel sensor. So again, why take this chance to end peoples life for some Driverless Car?

If we are going to have Driverless Cars then, they need to be a little safer before anyone can drive them. If we can't get our computers to work correctly sometimes, then why are we inventing Driverless Cars? If we keep working on Driverless Cars and they become safer, I will start to have an open mind. But again, anything could happen and cause a lot of people to get hurt. I would rather know I am fully incontrol of something, than not know.

Sometimes, inventing something new isn't always good. I think people are starting to become very lazy with all of the new technology today. We take these things for granted and then get hurt in the long run. So, I will stick to being against Driverless Cars because of everyones safety. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In a world of constant pressure to conform, it can be difficult to truly be oneself. Our society is constantly trying to change us, to mold us into the people that it prefers. But is this a successful pursuit? Ultimately, is the greatest accomplishment in the world being yourself in a world that is attempting to change the person you are?

To understand the answer to this question, it is important to look at the meaning behind being oneself. Being oneself is more than just the physical attributes that make up a person’s identity. It is about understanding who you are, and accepting it, even if that means going against the common norm. Being able to stand up for one’s beliefs, no matter how unpopular they may be, is a key part of being oneself. To be true to oneself in a world that is trying to change you is a major accomplishment.

It takes courage and conviction to stay true to oneself in the face of opposition. Doing so shows that not only have you accepted yourself, but that you are capable of standing up for something you believe in. In addition, it can be educational and inspiring to those that may follow a similar path. It may give them the confidence to follow the path of self-acceptance and discovery.

At the end of the day, though being oneself in a world constantly trying to change the person you are can be a daunting task, it is a great accomplishment that should be celebrated. To understand and accept oneself is a powerful thing, and it should be recognized and its power should be recognized. The greatest accomplishment in the world can be being yourself in a world that is attempting to change the person you are.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Dear principal TEACHER_NAME,

Most students spend their time and weekends texting, visiting friends, watching television, going to parties and getting into trouble. I believe that all students should be required to perform community service. Being active participants of community service will help students stay or become well rounded. Community service could better the way our towns and cities look. It would also give student an idea of what they would be required to do in high school and college.

I believe community service is a positive influence on all students. Just because it would take up some of students time doesn't mean it will take up all of their time.

Many students are lazy and complain they have nothing to do, if those same students could put there time and effort towards community service their perspectives would be changed. Community service wouldn't only change our community, but it would also change students and the way they view our environment.

"Phones and driving

Over the years technology has done nothing but advance forward with time. Resulting in two of many of society's most used technology; automobiles and cell phones. Cell Phones were created to make communication a lot easier, as well as mobile. So that one could easily contact or be contacted anywhere at any point. With vehicles it was somewhat the same deal, Find an easier, and quicker way to travel. Individually both inventions are credible to society, but is it safe for drivers to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? No, it is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving.

In order to use a phone your eyes, hands and attention must be on the device, looking through apps or sending messages can be very distracting while driving. Distracted is one thing one should not be when operating a vehicle, distracted driving can result in an accident which can either seriously injure or kill someone. When it comes to accidents caused by distracted driving the numbers are higher amongst teen drivers. In this generation teens are addicted to their phones and social media, it is harder for them to find a disconnect even when driving. ""In 2017, nearly 40 percent of high school students reported texting or emailing while driving."" ""Distracted driving is reported to be responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. In 2015, 391,000 injuries were caused in distracted driving related accidents. In that same year, distracted driving was cited as a major factor in 3,477 traffic deaths."" These statistics further prove how a cellular device should not be in use while driving a vehicle.

While using a phone when driving is extremely dangerous there is an alternative to using a device while operating a vehicle, bluetooth. Some people who have business related occupations may already have a bluetooth earpiece, but car manufacturers are now including bluetooth systems inside their cars. This feature allows one to connect their phone to their car, so that they can easily answer the phone by clicking a button on their wheel, and the car can read out sent text messages. One can respond by using voice typing, this allows people to easily answer phone calls and text messages without having to physically take their hands off the wheel. Minimizing accidents caused by distracted driving, talking on the phone and thinking on how to respond to a message can still be distracting and remove focus from the road. Therefore, even using the Bluetooth feature can be a cause of an automobile accident.

Overall, neither phones or alternative phone systems should be used while operating a vehicle. It is too distracting and the effect of one simply answering a text or phone call could be their or another driver's life. All phone calls, text messages, and photos can be answered and liked once the destination has been reached. It is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving.

"Dear principal,

You are faced with a tough decision about the cell phone policy at our school. I am writing to you to help you make a decision. There are two different policies that you can chose from. I personally believe that you should choose policy one. In this letter I am going to explain why I think you should chose policy one.

Foremost students would enjoy school a lot more than normal. They would be able to text their friends while on the bus instead of yelling what they were trying to say.

Secondly they wouldn't have to sneak phones into school and text underneath their desks during class. They would me more attentive during class. As a result they would get higher scores on tests and would be more likely to get an A or a B.

Thirdly students would not get up from their lunch table and go to their friend lunch table to talk to each other. It would also result in a quieter lunch room because less people would be talking.

Finally thank you for reading my letter to you. I hope you make the right choice and have a good day.

"Have you ever needed advice and one person is not enough to help you so you should for sure have multiple people giving you advice it would surely be enough to help you. I believe that people should have multiple people helping them because they can give you better advice because they so much ideas that different people have. Therefore, you should for sure ask for more people to give you advice If before you only asked one person. I say that because of these three reasons They can give new ideas, you can make better choices, and there is different points of view.

One reason that you should ask more people for advice is because they can give you more and new ideas. I say that because if theres different people with different minds then others they can surely give you and idea you never thought about. I know this because it happened to me before I was very mad because my parents did not buy me a toy. Then I asked many different cousins of what should I do to get that toy and many said be good or others said just dont get it and that gave little me so much to think about that I never even thought of before so that helped me because I got much more things to think about then just constantly wanting that toy. Also even researches say that 80% of people who ask for advice to many people get better outcomes. There is no reason for you to only ask one person if you get so much good things to ask more.

The second reason I say that multiple advice is better then only one is that you can make better choices. Lets say that you need help on what to spend your allowance on and you have two things that you like but you can only get one. Would you want one person to help you with deciding which one to get or multiple people giving you feedback so you can make a good choice. If you would only want one person to help you let me tell you why thats not a good choice they could easily think for what they would love to have and not what you would love to have. For example lets say the two things is a dog and a cat they could easily be a dog person and just say dog but if there was multiple people they would give you reasons on why you should get the dog. Even research that a lot of scientists have found that is that 75% of people who ask for multiple people for advice makes better choices.

The final reason on why you should ask multiple people for advice is that there is more points of view. This is a lesson that I learned before too because this has happened to me before. One time I was devastated that my parents would not let me play video games. Eventually, I asked my parents themselves on why i'm not allowed to play video games and they said think about it this way what if you were the parent would you let a child that has school tomorrow and it is passed his bedtime play video games while he has not been on his best behavior. That gave me so much made me learn so much things the whole time I was looking from my point of view while I should have been looking from both of my parents point of view.

In conclusion sometimes one opinion can be better then one if the one person knows you very well. Although, in most cases more minds is better then one. Those three reasons clearly show that multiple people giving you advice is better then only one. Therefore, the next time you need advice try asking more then one person it could seriously make a difference. There is literally no reason on why you should ask one person for advice if you ask a lot more it can't make things worse for you it can only make things better for you.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to support mine, and others' choices to allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them whenever free time is available. Such as lunch time, you don't have to work on anything, or pay attention, it's your own free time. I think it is the perfect opportunity to use your cell phone.

Another great opportunity to use your phone would be between class periods. Let's say, that your mother is coming to pick you up early from school, but doesn't know where the front office is or where to sign you out. That is when you would call or text your mother and tell her where the front office is and where to sign you out.

Finally, a great opportunity to use your cell phone would be when you have advisory. Every single day in advisory, all we do is read or do worksheets, but what about when we are done with those books or worksheets. That would be the perfect time to use your cell phone. If you have an emergency, if you feel sick, if you have a broken bone, anything. Even though the nurse is there, sometimes she doesn't let you go home. Therefore, as a backup plan you could use your cell phone to contact your parent or guardian. I hope you take into consideration, my choice to allow students to use their cell phones during time that is available. Thank you for your time.

That policy is a horrible idea. It doesn't matter what the students average is maybe there staying for extra help or to join extra curricular activities.

"Dear, Florida Senators

I believe that the Electoral College is a good way of voting for a President and Vice President because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by  a single vote in Congress. The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors is the meeting where the electors vote for there President and Vice President. Plus the majority of the 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President of the United States. The United States entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. One each of the memebers in the House of Representives plus two of your Senators. In our state, each citizens have there own group of voters that vote for a President and Vice President of there chose. Some even vote for candidates that are going for a person running for President or Vice President. Our state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. '

Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If I lived in Texas, for example, and wanted to vote for [Adam] Pis , I'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Pis. On the note, that those electors won the statewide election, they would goto congress and Pis would get 34 electoral votes. There are a lot of questions that people ask, who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state that some citizens are living in because some states can have picked electors and some dont even pick electors so, it must depends what state the citizen lives in.

Perhaps worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representive from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representives from California, who represents 35 million voters. Its hard to think about this but some are right, abolish the electoral college!

"Curfews are a common way for parents to ensure that their teenagers are safe and responsible. However, many teenagers struggle to abide by these rules, which can have serious consequences. In this essay, I will investigate the potential consequences of disobeying a curfew set for teenagers during the week and weekends, research the legal requirements and penalties for breaking curfew, and explore potential alternative methods of discipline.

One of the most significant consequences of disobeying a curfew is the potential for legal consequences. In many states, breaking curfew is considered a misdemeanor, which can result in fines, community service, or even jail time. Additionally, if a teenager is caught breaking curfew multiple times, they may face more severe penalties, such as a suspended driver's license or even expulsion from school.

Another potential consequence of disobeying a curfew is the impact on a teenager's academic performance. Teenagers who consistently break curfew may struggle to attend school regularly, which can lead to missed assignments and lower grades. Furthermore, if a teenager is caught breaking curfew while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, they may face additional academic consequences, such as suspension or expulsion.

In addition to legal and academic consequences, disobeying a curfew can also have social consequences. Teenagers who consistently break curfew may be seen as irresponsible and unreliable by their peers, which can damage their reputation and relationships. Furthermore, if a teenager is caught breaking curfew while engaging in risky behavior, such as vandalism or theft, they may face social consequences, such as being ostracized from their peer group.

Given the potential consequences of disobeying a curfew, it is essential for parents to explore alternative methods of discipline. One effective method is to have open and honest communication with their teenagers about the importance of curfews and the potential consequences of breaking them. Parents can also explore alternative methods of discipline, such as grounding or limiting privileges, that are tailored to their teenager's specific needs and interests.

In conclusion, disobeying a curfew set for teenagers during the week and weekends can have serious consequences, including legal, academic, and social consequences. It",1,llammistral7binstruct,2

Dear Principal,

I think all students should be required to perform community service. Many wouldn't agree with me because they want to spend time watching T.V. or playing video games. But I think it's a very generous thing to perform community services. It helps people out, and makes you a better person. I think everybody should spend some of their own time donating their help.

Many people would argue that they wouldn't get to hang out with their friends or have any fun doing community service. I disagree. You could have your friends help you with the service, and you could get more accomplished. It makes you a better person. Helping others makes you feel good.

Kids might also complain that community service would be too boring. But it doesn't have to be boring. You can make it fun. Maybe instead of picking up litter you could help out at an animal shelter and take care of cute, little puppies. You could use one of your interests and find a community service that would have to do with that interest. It doesn't have to be boring, having a bad attitude about it would make it seem that way.

Many people don't realize how good they have it, and that they are lucky to have what they have. That's why some wouldn't want to perform community services. I am all for volunteering and doing community services. It makes you feel like a better person, and you have that nice thought knowing you helped somebody out. This is why I think all students should perform community services. Please consider my opinion. Thank you.

Its a great way to stop all the confusion and know if someone is happy to see you. Although its a great tool for everyday life, it's not a great asset in a classrom. Using technology to read the emotional expression of studuents in a classroom is not valuable becausse we should focus on teaching valuable material and its lack of accuracy.

The classroom is simply meant to learn. Evidendently, there is no reason to know what your student is feeling and not feeling. ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements..."" Like all devices, this Facial Action Coding System can have manfuctions. Instead of wasting class time to try the Coding system, you should use that time to focus on learning new valuable material and focusing on school and nothing else.

However, it states to be able to calcuate emotions like math homework but sometimes we get calculations worng. ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Facial Action Coding system seems to rate all of the Mona LIsa's emotions from what she feels the most to least. Clearly stating that the Coding system ranks all emotions from least to greater.

"Some schools require students to complete A summer project to assure they continue learning during their break. Should it be teacher-designed or student designed. I think it should be student-designed. One reason why i think it should be student designed is because more students will do it. Second reason is that a lot more of the students would have more to talk about.

One of my reason why i think it should be student designed is because it would get done by more of the students. when teachers ask you to do school work in the summer some students will forget and some will not even try but If the student could pick what kind of project they wanted to do more students would be interested.

My second reason is that if it was picked by the students they have more to talk about. Like they could pick something that is interesting to them. They wouldnt have to just think about school it could be about a lot more of stuff like sports,games,special events and a lot more stuff. It would be more special and a lot of the students would be creative and they could help each other with it.

That is why i think it should be student-designed. everything doesnt have to be picked out by teachers sometimes you have to let the students pick it out.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Setting a good example is an effective way of influencing others, as opposed to authoritarian and traditional methods of control. People of all ages respond positively to visible demonstrations of good behaviour. Seeing someone else set a good example encourages others to follow suite. It triggers the urge to mimic that behaviour and the person setting the example becomes a role model, thereby setting off a chain reaction. 

In contrast, authoritarian and traditional methods of control are often met with resentment and frustration. As evidenced by numerous psychological studies, individuals struggle to accept and act upon instructions that are imposed on them. Not surprisingly, they also find it difficult to embrace any positive behaviour derived from such enforced rules and regulations. 

The effectiveness of setting a good example therefore should not be underestimated. As an influential tool, it has the power to positively affect the behaviour of a large group of people. Furthermore, it can also inspire greatness within them by triggering a sense of responsibility and integrity.  To conclude, setting a good example is an effective way of inspiring and influencing others and should be employed whenever possible.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"In this passage, the author uses evidence to support the idea that human curiosity should overpower and enable us to explore the unknown and seemingly impossible regardless of the risks or repercussions. Venus, Earth's closest neighbor to the sun, poses one of these risks that could be overcome by desires of humanity. Despite its realtion in size and distance to Earth, Venus is much different and inhabitable for humans due to its thick atmosphpere corrosive atmosphere. Though it seems that true exploration of our sister planet could never be completed, isn't it worth the risk to discover as much as we can for the saie of humanity and its curiosity? The author of this passage seems to think so and does a great job of explaining why further exploration of Venus needs to occur regardless of the obstacles.

First, the author notes a specific way in which humans can encounter Venus' landscape and conditions that is both safe and productive. In this way, a form of spacecraft would not come in direct contact with Venus' surface, but it would hover above its atmosphere and be able to collect data on the dily occurences on Venus. This circumstance would allow humans to study Venus for themselves instead of a ship that would send data back to a base on Earth. The author also notes that researchers are developing ways to allows spacecraft to survive the conditions on Venus for a long enough period to collect data from its surface. Based on the type of technology that we have today, systems like these can be improved to resist the extreme conditions of Venus itself. If scientists are able to make products on Earth that could last through simulated versions of Venus here, then there should be no debate whether its worth a shot or not.

Overall, the author makes great use of the evidence they have to support the idea that Venus is worth exploring despite its obstacles. They also do a great job of looking into the developments and possiblities of the future that can further enable scientists and researchers to fulfill the desires to learn more about Venus. They wrap up their essay by saying that the exploration of the unknown should not be pushed aside because of the obstacles presented within it, which is a great overview of the side in favor of adventuring through Venus altogether.

"The author who wrote ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" did a wonderful job at suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy job. The author seems very educated and intellectual. The writing also seem very credible. The author backed up their idea by supporting their beliefs well with evidence. The author also provided numerous informations of planet Venus. Not only did they support it with facts, but also with wisdom.

The author started by giving readers information about Venus and how it relates to Earth, our world. The author described Venus as ""Earth's twin."" The author also let the reader know that Venus in the ""closes planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" By doing so, we may feel more connected to Venus since Earth is our home. It chatches our attention because we may feel that we can relate.

After readers get into reading, the author provided more great details about Venus. He described planet Venus conditions and why it is so challenging for scientists to study the ""Evening Star."" According to the author, the ""conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"" and ""would liquefy many metals."" He also gave a background information on how each ""previous mission was unmanned"" and ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This illustrates how dangerous Venus is. However, the author turn this negativity into a way to learn mistakes. The author says ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus,"" in a way that those factors that may have led to fail previous missions could now be avoided. Mistakes do really teach us lessons.

After the author discussed about the dangers and challenges of Venus, readers may wonder why scientists would even bother to study such a life-less planet. Nonetheless, the author did a great job of backing up the counterclaim. The author argued back the counterclaim by explaining how Venus was once like Earth. It may have been a planet that ""supported various forms of life"" and ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This may give readers hope and maybe change their perspective a little bit.

The author knows best about the dangers of exploring Venus than anyone. However, the author supported why it is still worth studying Venus by backing up with science. He talk about how NASA is working on devices that could stand on the harsh conditions on Venus. He also provided other promising projects NASA are working on such as "" a vehicle hovering over Venus"" that ""would avoid the unfriendly ground condtions by staying up and out of their way."" By doing this so, readers may be more hopeful and trust the author more. This also give the author to look forward to the future and more energy to further study Venus. The author also believe that it may be ""survivable for humans"" even though Venus does not have ""easy conditions."" It is in human nature to fight for survival, so readers may be interested.

The author is not only intellectual, but also very wise. They finished their argument by talking about how it may seem pointless to study such a dark world, but it is not always about science and facts but also it may ""lead us into many equally intimiating endeavors."" The author believe that we can do so much more than what we are given and are restricted of. The author believe that we should go beyond the limit. Never to hold back our curiosity but to let it ""expanded to meet the very edges of imaginaton and innovation.""",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, so like, after high school, there are a lot of different career options that we can choose from. It's kinda hard to decide though, cuz there are pros and cons to each one. Some people think it's better to make a decision early, but others think it's better to wait until after high school. So, I did some research to see what's up.

One of the pros of making a decision early is that you can start working towards your goal right away. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you can start taking science classes in 9th grade and get a head start on college. That way, you can finish college faster and start working sooner. Plus, you can start gaining experience in your field by volunteering or getting internships. That way, when you do graduate, you'll be way more prepared for the real world.

But, there are also some cons to making a decision early. For one thing, you might not know what you want to do yet. Like, I'm not even sure if I want to go to college yet. And if you pick a career too early, you might end up hating it and wasting time and money. So, it's important to keep your options open and not make a final decision until you're sure.

On the other hand, waiting until after high school can be good too. For one thing, you can take a gap year and travel or volunteer or something. That way, you can get some real-world experience and figure out what you want to do. Plus, you can take more time to think about what you want to do and not rush into anything. And, you can take classes in different subjects to see what you're good at and what you like.

But, there are also some cons to waiting. For one thing, you might miss out on opportunities to get started on your career early. And, if you wait too long, you might not have enough time to finish college or get the experience you need. So, it's important to find a balance between taking your time and not waiting too long.

In the end, I think the best thing to do is to take your time and",1,llama2_chat,0
"Phone or No Phone?

Many people in the world today are distracted by a little screen called a cell phone. Some say they are dangerous while driving, have you ever thought of them being safe while driving? Having cell phones in a vehicle period can be safer, they do not have to be texting and driving. See, if you were to pick up the cell phone while driving, then of course it would be dangerous and put you at a higher risk. However, when you have a cell phone in the vehicle it can be used for navigation, emergencies, and for the parent's safety.

Imagine driving in the middle of nowhere and not having a clue of where you are going. That is where having a cell phone comes into place. You can use navigation on your device and it will give you a faster route and show you where you are going. It will also give you options on the nearest gas stations, places to eat, and resting places. With navigation, you are more likely to not get lost and it also gives you a destined time of arrival, along with faster routes.

Being safe in a vehicle is top priority, which is why having a cell phone can reduce the risks when there is an emergency. For instance, if there happens to be a car crash and someone is injured and if you have your cell phone then you can call for help. This can reduce the number of people getting injured and they can be sent to safety faster. Also, when you call for help and you happen to not know where you are, the police or whoever can track your phone and locate where you are and you will be able to receive, help. Even with this new technology, most cars have a method called ""hands-free"" and you are able to call, text, and navigate while keeping your hands on the steering wheel at all times. that is why Getting help quicker and easier is top priority for someone who just got into a car accident, and cell phones can make that happen, and how the hands-free method reduces these risks.

The last safety cell phones offer is the ability for a parent with children to know where they are at all times. Today with the new technology parents are able to track their kids with just one touch. If something were to happen to their child and the parent does not know where they are, they can track their phone and it tell them where they are. For example, there is an app called life three-sixty and this app allows the parents to see where their children are going, how fast they are going, if they run a red light, are speeding, etc. This app is very crucial when it come to a parent looking out for their kid. This app almost helps the parents because they feel a sense of comfort, knowing where their child is at.

Overall, having a phone in the vehicle while you are driving can be safe when it comes down to certain priorities. As long as you don't pick up the phone while driving, or go down to look at it. You are safe and put yourself at a lower risk. Things like having a GPS helps you navigate where you are, and can locate you for emergencies, as well as the parents feeling comforted knowing where their child is with one touch at their hands. Having a cellular device in a vehicle is safe, however it is up to you whether you want to put your life at risk when picking the phone up.                ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Many may agrue that students should continue getting their education in the summer, but the summer time is when students get a break from school. Summer projects should be student designed because many students want to enjoy themselves and work full time jobs.

During summer break many students choose to enjoy themselves. The entire time while on the break the project that needs to be completed will be on students minds. Students designing their summer projects can give them an opportunity to finish the task and enjoy themselve. In contrast, with teachers designing projects students are least likely to get completed during the break because of how uninterested they are. Many may disagree that all students isn't going to complete the projects, which is true most students care more about getting tasks done than others.

Students who want to make money in the summer decides to work full time jobs, projects will be the last thing on their mind, its important that the project is something that students interest. Working and having to do a project can be alot, but some students can weigh things out and make it happen. Not everyone can multitask sometimes people's mind be set on one thing at a time. However, students may take control in completing the project they designed. Many may agrue that students wouldn't think about the project and work at the same time, but with students designing the project it may incourage them to complete the it.

Projects may not be the most exicited thing in the world but if schools required it students will be more likey to complete it if they designed it. Summer break is a time where students want to get a break from school, have fun, or make money. Projects can't completing ruin students summer break but it can ruin their grade, its more reasonable to give students a project that may catch their eyes. Many may agrue that students don't think about doing any work in the summer time, but if the work is something that interesting students may take toll on completing it.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Is studying Venus worth the dangers it presents to people? This topic is often debated, many want to but cannot seem to overcome the atmoshperic conditions. The author of this article thinks it is worth exploring. The modern electronics wouldn't survive,it's tempurature is 800 degrees and NASA's sulotion has even greater diffficulties.

The third paragraph in this article the author discusses the planets atmopshere and temperature. The atmosohere surronding Venus is 97 percent carbone dioxide,a gas deadly to humans. The clouds around Venus are very corrosive sulfuric acid, and the pressure is 90 times greater then on earth. The temperature at the surface is 800 degrees. These climates are far more extreme than any climate on eath. The author does not give a very good reason the danger are worth it in this peregraph. These dangers could very easily end a life of any person willing ot explor Venus.

In paragraph four the author discusses how NASA wants to send people to study venus. They do not currently have any invintions that would allow humans to be on the sufrace of Venus. They are purposing a vehicle similar to a blimp that would travel 30 miles above the surface of Venus. The heat would still be a 170 degrees, but the pressure would be survivable. However in paragraph six the author continues to shut down ideas, that would prove their point. They talk about how the atmosphere is so dense that light would not be able to penetrate it. Then continues to talk about how they couldnt gather rock,gas or any other samples. They also state that standered photography and videagraphy would be useless.

In paraghrap seven the author goes over the aproaches of tecnology. They say NASA is working on some electronics made of siclicon carbide,though they are simplified they lasted three weeks in a simulatution of Venuses atmosphere. They are also working on old technology. The devices were first thougt of in the 1800s and played a big part during world war two. The devices used levers and gears to make calculations. They do not work as quickly as modern computers but are less sensetive to extreme conditions.

Over all the author of this article did a poor job supporting this idea. They made many claims, but the counter claims seemed to take more importance. In the last paragraph the author seems to support the idea better then in the rest of the article.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"In a suburb city in Germany, people have quit using their cars. Why ? so the communtiy can create denser cities and so people can walk with more space and not worrying about any car accidents that could happen while their walking or driving an automobile. Paris has also banned the use of automobiles so that the air inthe community can perhaps not get too polluted with gas, oil, and other chemicals that damage us. Here a are few advantages people can optain with these new rules and laws.

If fewer automobiles are used during day and night, people who walk from work, or ruuning errands can have an easier time breating the less-polluting air. In many locations around the world has residents that don't own or use a car or motorcycle because this can benefit the community by making it safer to walk. I source 4, the passage shares information about percentages of young people that own cars, but rarely use them on a daily basis. Source 3 talks about a couple cities in Colombia declining car use since a variety of people in Colombia have car and motorcycle access, the streets get polluted extremely easy, so residents tried to reduce the amount of smog in the community.

My grandfather who live in Cali, Colombia for example, dislikes relying on his car so much to travel places. Many times, he walks to certin locations beacuse he explained to people who lives on his street the damage car oil and gas can effect the communtiy harmfully. To many people, driving cars is the normal way to get to places, but to others, walking is their best option.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"To the Principle

Many students at our school disagree with the fact that your considering changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B average. But I think its a good idea.

Its a good idea because students who do have less than a C average should not be apart of school activities because they should concentrate on their grades and how to make them better . Also students who are participating focus so much on their sports that they don't pay enough attention to school work so their grades drop down. Maybe not being apart of sports for a while can help them regain back the focus they need to do better educationally.

Some students disagree with the policy change because they think they cant do better than a C average. But really they can all they need to do is focus more on school instead of other activities .Also some student with lower than a C average have put so much effort into their activities that they don't think that its fair for them not to be able to continue to participate in sports or activities.

In conclusion its is a good consideration to change the schools sports or activities policy, it may help some students.

"""All of our development since World War II has been centered on a car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. To some or most a stament like this may seem outlandish or absurd. We use cars for daily life, to make it through this world, whether its to work, school, the store, it seems almost impossible to live without one. Vauban, Germany is an upscale community of suburban pioneers who have simply given up their vehicles. As many as 70 percent of Vauban's famalies do not own cars. Heidrun Walter, a resident and mother of two, says she is ""much happier this way"". So what it is that has caused many communites like Vauban to take the advantage of living without a car? Green House gases better known as smog, that is polluting our air that we breathe.

In some places like the beloved Paris, home of the Eiffel Tower, smog has gotten out of hand. Paris has even enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. After 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty seven had their cars impounded for their claimed reaction to the fine, the congestion was finally down 60 percent. Beijing, China, known for being the most polluted cities in the world the smog rivals. You might even see people wearing masks in Beijing for their own health and safety.

Bogota, Colombia has caught on and spread this idea to other countries as well. For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis allowed for a Day Without Cars. Not even rain or shine stopped Colombians from traveling accordingly. Instead of being pessimistic about traveling alternatively most Colombian see it as a good opprutunity to take away stress and lower smog. So, imagine a day without cars in the bustling city of our own, maybe like Detroit. Well it seems that President Obama is catching on.

Recent studies suggest a drop in Americans getting licenses', buying cars, and driving all together as years pass. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and is dropping from there steadily. Could it be that Americans love for cars is simply not what it used to be? Or is it that more alternate and practical ways of travel are now being provided and accepted widely? Either way if our country keeps up the good work sociologist believe it will have ""beneficical implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment"".

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that one of the most important things in life is to listen to your heart and mind when making decisions. It is easy to get caught up in the opinions and expectations of others, but ultimately, it is our own thoughts and feelings that guide us towards success.

One of the main reasons why it is important to listen to your heart and mind is because it allows us to make decisions that are truly in line with our values and goals. When we rely too heavily on the opinions of others, we may end up making decisions that do not align with our own beliefs and desires. This can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and a lack of fulfillment in life.

Another reason why it is important to listen to your heart and mind is because it allows us to stay motivated and focused on our goals. When we are constantly surrounded by negativity and doubt, it can be difficult to stay motivated and on track. However, by tuning out the noise and focusing on our own thoughts and feelings, we can stay motivated and committed to achieving our goals.

Of course, it can be difficult to ignore the opinions and expectations of others, especially when they come from people we care about or respect. However, it is important to remember that ultimately, it is our own thoughts and feelings that guide us towards success. By staying true to ourselves and listening to our heart and mind, we can make decisions that lead to a fulfilling and successful life.

Should you have more that one persons opinion before you make an important decision. Getting opinion from more than one person helps you can make better decision and helps you learn form other mistakes.

Getting opinions from multiple people helps you can have a more educated decision . Opinions are based on one person experience, you can ask one person form a car wreck what they saw and then you can ask someone else and they can say something completely different based on point of view. If you only get one opinion from one person and base your decision off of that one opinion and you don't like the outcome, for example if you ask one person what it's like to have long nails and they say that love and you long nails and end up hatting it. Getting multiple opinions can help you make better decisions.

Getting other peoples opinions can help you Learn from other people mistake. People who are usually older than you have more experience. your parents for example might have made a mistake at one point and if you ask for their opinion on something they can give you their opinion. you don't learn everything the hard way, if you get multiple opinions and multiple people say you shouldn't go somewhere then you can grow from their mistakes and go somewhere else.

"Graduating early from high school has been a topic of discussion for many years. While some students see it as an opportunity to get ahead, others view it as a burden that can hinder their future success. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of graduating early from high school and analyze the responsibilities and benefits of doing so.

One of the main advantages of graduating early from high school is that it allows students to pursue their dreams and aspirations earlier. For instance, if a student wants to attend a prestigious college or university, they can apply earlier and increase their chances of being accepted. Additionally, early graduates can start their careers sooner, which can lead to more job opportunities and higher salaries.

However, graduating early from high school also comes with its fair share of responsibilities. For example, early graduates may feel pressured to attend college immediately, even if they are not ready. This can lead to financial strain and a lack of maturity, which can negatively impact their academic and personal growth.

Another disadvantage of graduating early from high school is that it can limit the amount of time students have to explore their interests and passions. High school is a time for students to discover what they love and pursue their hobbies and extracurricular activities. Early graduates may miss out on these experiences, which can lead to feelings of regret and a lack of fulfillment.

On the other hand, graduating early from high school can also provide students with a sense of accomplishment and pride. Early graduates have achieved a significant milestone in their lives and can use this accomplishment to boost their confidence and motivation. Additionally, early graduates may have a better understanding of the real world and the responsibilities that come with it, which can prepare them for the future.

In conclusion, graduating early from high school has both advantages and disadvantages. While it can provide students with opportunities to pursue their dreams and aspirations earlier, it also comes with responsibilities that can hinder their future success. Ultimately, the decision to graduate early from high school should be made carefully, taking into consideration the student's individual circumstances and goals.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Ugh, do I really have to write another essay?  Fine.

So, should classes in the arts be mandatory or an elective in school? I think they should be mandatory. Here's why.

First of all, arts classes are super fun. Like, I know some people might think they're boring, but trust me, they're not. Painting, drawing, playing music, and stuff like that can be really enjoyable. Plus, it's not like you're gonna be stuck in there all day. You get to express yourself and be creative, which is like, really important for kids. It helps you relax and stuff.

And, um, did you know that arts classes can actually help you do better in other subjects? Like, math and science? Yeah, it's true. Research shows that kids who take arts classes tend to do better in those subjects too. It's like, they help you develop your brain or something. So, if you're not into math or science, taking an arts class can be a good way to improve your grades.

Another thing is that arts classes can help you prepare for your future. Like, if you want to be an artist or something, taking art classes can help you figure out if that's really what you want to do. And even if you don't want to be an artist, having experience in the arts can make you a more well-rounded person. It shows that you're not just a bunch of numbers and formulas, you know?

Okay, so, some people might say that arts classes are a waste of time because not everyone is going to be an artist or anything. But, like, that's not the point. The point is that it's good for you, no matter what you want to do in life. And, um, it's not like you're gonna fail if you don't take arts classes. Like, you can still be a doctor or a scientist or whatever if you don't take arts. So, it's not like it's a big deal if you don't take them.

"I am Luke Bomberger and I just graduated from High school and had two part time jobs. One was at the bank and another at the grocery store. One day my friend Don Reist asked me if I wanted to go to Euroope on a cattle boat, and I could not resit it.

It was 1945 and World War two had just ended and the UNRRA joined together and helped the coutries to recover from the war. UNNRA hired ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ to take care of the cattle that were shipped over seas. Don and I signed up to do this position. In August we got orders to go to New Orleans. I had 335 horses that I had to take care of.

After about two weeks we finally arrived, but caring for the animals kept me busy.

They had to be fed and watered at least two or three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be dragged from the lower holds of the ship and the stalls had to be cleaned out. I had helped out at my aunt? farm when I was younger but I was not prepared for the dangers on the sea. On my second trip I was going to go make my hourly report to the captain and I slid down a slippery ladder. A small metal strip had stopped me from going into the dark atlantic, but I was not able to work for a couple days because my ribs were cracked.

This job kept me very busy, and had many oppertunities to see things I have never seen before. I halso had found some times that I could have fun on board instead of having to care for the animals. After the animals would be dropped off we would head back. We played all kinds of activites and games. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball in empty places were the animals were.

"In today's society, it is essential to have the ability to influence others positively. This can be done through various means, including examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice. In this essay, I will analyze the effectiveness of these methods and provide evidence to support my argument.

One of the most powerful ways to influence others positively is through examples. People are often more likely to follow the actions of those they admire or respect. For instance, a teacher who consistently demonstrates a positive attitude and work ethic can inspire their students to do the same. A study conducted by the University of Michigan found that students who had a positive role model were more likely to achieve academic success and engage in prosocial behavior (Kurtz & Algoe, 2015).

Another effective method of influencing others positively is through actions. People often judge others based on their behavior, and taking positive actions can have a significant impact. For example, volunteering at a local charity or participating in a community event can demonstrate a commitment to helping others and inspire others to do the same. A study by the University of Pennsylvania found that people who engaged in prosocial behavior were more likely to be perceived as kind and compassionate by others (Dunn, 2008).

Reasons are also an effective way to influence others positively. When people understand the benefits of a particular behavior or action, they are more likely to adopt it. For example, explaining the health benefits of exercising regularly can motivate others to start an exercise routine. A study by the American Heart Association found that people who received information about the benefits of exercise were more likely to engage in regular physical activity (Hillman & Tate, 2009).

Finally, personal advice can be a powerful tool for influencing others positively. People often seek advice from those they trust and respect, and taking their advice into consideration can lead to positive changes. For example, a friend who has successfully navigated a difficult situation can offer valuable advice to someone going through a similar experience. A study by the University of California, Los Angeles found that people who received advice from others were more likely to engage in positive behaviors and achieve their goals (Rogers & Fazio, 1989).

In conclusion, examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice are all effective methods for influencing others positively.",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"As an eighth-grade student, I have learned the importance of seeking multiple opinions when making decisions. In my experience, seeking multiple opinions can help me make better decisions by preventing poor choices, determining which advice is accurate, and helping to ensure comfort with decisions.

Firstly, seeking multiple opinions can help me prevent poor choices. When I seek out different perspectives, I am able to consider a variety of factors that may not have been immediately apparent to me. This allows me to make more informed decisions and avoid choices that may have negative consequences. For example, if I am deciding on a new hobby, seeking the opinions of friends and family can help me determine which hobbies are appropriate for my interests and skill level.

Secondly, seeking multiple opinions can help me determine which advice is accurate. When I seek out different perspectives, I am able to compare and contrast the advice I receive. This allows me to determine which advice is most relevant and reliable. For example, if I am deciding on a college major, seeking the opinions of teachers, peers, and career counselors can help me determine which majors are most suitable for my interests and career goals.

Lastly, seeking multiple opinions can help me ensure comfort with my decisions. When I seek out different perspectives, I am able to gain a better understanding of the potential consequences of my decisions. This allows me to feel more confident in my choices and less likely to regret them. For example, if I am deciding on a new job opportunity, seeking the opinions of colleagues and friends can help me understand the company culture and determine if it is a good fit for me.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is an important aspect of making better decisions. By preventing poor choices, determining which advice is accurate, and ensuring comfort with decisions, seeking multiple opinions can help me make more informed and confident choices. I encourage others to seek out different perspectives when making decisions, as it can lead to better outcomes and a greater sense of satisfaction.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"Over Summer break, certain students are required to complete projects to ensure that they're learning during their time off of school. Summer projects are quite beneficial to students; they allow students to become more knowledgeable about a subject during the process of completion. Although, a few factors should be considered when creating them. These types of projects should be designed by teachers since they're aware of the curriculum, it'll avoid students from making it too easy, and it could potentially benefit the students.

When teaching, the teachers must teach according to the school's curriculum. They also have a complex understanding of the material that they share with their students. With this knowledge, they'll know what to include when designing the projects. Not only do these assignments encourage the students to learn, but some teachers assign these projects based on the new material they'll be learning when they come back. Therefore, they will be prepared for the new unit when it's introduced to them at school.

A majority of students come to school prepared and eager to learn. The rest of those students are typically known to be lazy or carefree when it comes to schoolwork. If they get the opportunity to design a summer project, some of them might take a shortcut, which may defeat the purpose of the project. Without authority, numerous students obtain the idea to go after something they normally wouldn't go for if they had a sense of authority. Some will put in zero to no effort into designing the projects.

The purpose of assigning these projects to students is to ensure that they keep learning. Certain students won't gain much knowledge if they're not given the right tools to learn. Another factor that comes into play is that kids sometimes feel pressured when a teacher expects them to fulfill something. Sometimes they need a sense of direction when they're clueless about what to do; lack of direction may sometimes lead to confusion.

With these reasons in mind, teachers should design summer assignments for their students, instead of the other way around. Students will be ready to absorb more knowledge and will be able to understand the material in a deeper meaning. Overall, teachers know what's best for their students. If the projects are done in an organized manner, this may guarantee success into a student's school career.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"The use of technology and communication is crucial in the development of games and activities that people can enjoy. In order to create games that are enjoyable, employees need access to tools that enable them to build better games. Additionally, communication is essential for people to enjoy the games. In this essay, I will analyze the use of technology and communication in game development and examine the types of technologies available and the ways that companies use them to create their games.

One of the most important technologies used in game development is game engines. Game engines provide a framework for game development, allowing developers to create games quickly and efficiently. Some popular game engines include Unity, Unreal Engine, and CryEngine. These engines provide a wide range of features, including 3D graphics, physics, and animation, that make it easier for developers to create high-quality games.

Another important technology used in game development is virtual reality (VR). VR technology allows players to fully immerse themselves in a game, providing a more realistic and enjoyable gaming experience. VR technology is used in a variety of games, including first-person shooters, adventure games, and simulation games.

Communication is also essential for game development. Effective communication between team members is crucial for the success of a game. Developers need to be able to communicate their ideas clearly and effectively in order to build better games. Additionally, communication with players is important for game developers to understand what players want and need in a game.

One way that communication can be used as a tool to help employees come up with good ideas in order to build better games is through brainstorming sessions. Brainstorming sessions allow employees to come together and share their ideas, leading to the creation of new and innovative game ideas.

In conclusion, the use of technology and communication is crucial in the development of games and activities that people can enjoy. Game engines and virtual reality technology are important tools that enable developers to create high-quality games. Effective communication between team members is also essential for the success of a game. By utilizing these tools and techniques, game developers can create games that are enjoyable and engaging for players.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"When your looking for advice go to multiple people that you trust when seeking their advice. Asking more than one person can lead you to the right answers or choices you have to decided to make. Asking more people can give you more choices and ideas to choose about something. Hearing multiple people and their opinions can make you feel good about your choice and not make you regret the choice you chosen. Some people might have bad ideas and some might have good ideas,put those together and the right choice is there for you.

Asking more than one person can lead you to making the right choice or answers because some people might have bad ideas and some may have good ideas. Hearing people bad ideas will shorten your choices of making a bad choice about something that can't be undo. Hearing other people good ideas can give you even more good choices to add on to your choose you chosen. Getting advice from other people is a good thing also because some people are going to tell you what you want to here,but most people is going to tell you what you don't want to here. The right answers is always what you don't want to here because the people that tells you what you want to here is just trying to make you feel better than telling you the right answer.

Another reason for asking multiple people you can get more ideas about something. Everybody is not the same, people like different things so when asking multiple people rather than one person you can get different ideas from everybody to come up with your own idea. Some people are creative and good thinkers when it comes to giving advice or ideas so when you asking one person something you only hearing one person idea and advice instead you can be listening to multiple people. If you only asking one person you can get either a bad choice or a good answers but when asking multiple people you can most likely get a good choice. You just have to trust the people your seeking for advice and ideas from to make your choice a good choice.

Finally when your Hearing more than one person advice or idea you can feel like you made the right choice because you heard all these bad and good advice or ideas from other people. Other people who are different form each other,who have different personality and ideas. This makes you not regret the choice you chosen because all the people you trust gave you advice ad ideas so all you got to do is put everybody opinion together and come up with your choice. If you only took advice and ideas form one person you would second guess yourself because you heard one advice that might be bad or good. Everybody is creative in their own way and at different things not just one person.

Conclusion is that people should go to multiple people instead of one person. They want to make a good choice so going to multiple people you can hear different advice or ideas than hearing one person. Going to multiple people that you trust and won't tell you what you want to hear is going to lead you to the right choice. Ask people who are creative and hard thinkers they will give great advice or ideas. when coming up with your choice take everybody advice and yours and you will get the right choice or idea about something.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"As an 8th grader, I have been given the task of writing an essay about extending the school day two hours to conserve energy and resources. This is a controversial topic that has been discussed for a while now, and I believe it's important to examine both sides of the argument before making a decision.

On one hand, extending the school day could help conserve energy and resources by reducing the amount of energy needed to power schools. According to the National Energy Foundation, schools use a significant amount of energy for heating, cooling, and lighting. By extending the school day, schools could reduce the amount of energy used during peak hours, which could lead to cost savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, extending the school day could provide more time for students to learn and engage in extracurricular activities, which could lead to better academic performance and a more well-rounded education.

On the other hand, extending the school day could have negative consequences for students, parents, and society as a whole. For students, extending the school day could lead to increased fatigue and stress, which could negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being. Many students already struggle to balance schoolwork and extracurricular activities, and adding more time to the school day could make it even harder for them to keep up. Additionally, extending the school day could make it harder for parents to balance work and family responsibilities, as they may have to provide transportation and supervision for their children during the extended school day.

Society could also be negatively impacted by extending the school day. For example, if schools extend their hours, it could lead to increased traffic congestion and air pollution, as more students and parents commute to and from school. Additionally, extending the school day could lead to a lack of diversity in extracurricular activities, as some students may not be able to participate due to scheduling conflicts or financial constraints.

In my opinion, extending the school day two hours is not the best solution for conserving energy and resources. While I understand the potential benefits of extended learning time, I believe that there are other ways to achieve these benefits without adding more time to the school day. For example, schools could offer more extracurricular activities during the school day, or provide students with additional resources and",1,llama2_chat,1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think community service is a wonderful thing for the people and for the community. In my opinion i do think community service should be required, because it gives kids in the community rights to straighten up and learn to act mature around other citizens. It will cause a less amount of labor for older citizens in the Frisco community. Also it will get several of amounts of work and jobs done.

For the punks that slack off in class and don't do what their supposed to do or told to do it will also give them something to do instead of slack off by the TV all day and play video game. I've always thought community service was a good thing for the trouble makers and just for the kids that want to be responsible in their young life future.

Almost my whole life i have tried to teach people how to have good manners and how to act mature. Community service is by far the way to role. Community service is already required for the citizens that choose to make the wrong choices and slack off.

why not just make it for everyone. It will give a person something to do and go on their record of time made up. Because if you don't already know the thugs and punks in this world that make bad choices usually end up regretful and don't succeed in life, and end up working off at gas stations with no money in their bank

For the humans that don't need it but might want it give it to them and let them be a top leader in life for people to follow as a role model. Community service for everyone!!!

"In today's society, students often find themselves in an enormous level of stress. Whether it is from social anxiety or overbearing schoolwork, the stress is there, and some schools have offered a solution. Distance learning, or school classes at home, have a positive impact on students lives by protecting them from bullying, softening the workload, and creating an atmosphere where children can focus and learn at their own pace.

Bullying is a problem in schools all over America. Oprah Winfrey once stated, ""the best way to avoid bullying is to isolate the bully from its source."" By placing students that may not feel comfortable in large crowds or a student that gets bullied into programs such as these- you have separated the bullies from the bullied allowing the problem to diminish itself.

Oftentimes, students are faced with a workload that can affect their home life and other extracurricular activities and hobbies. A student enrolled in advanced placement classes often need more time for homework than a student in a standard class. This leads to even more stress because while one regularly placed student has finished their homework hours ago, the advanced student may be rushing to finish theirs, willing to turn in sub-potential work, just to go out with friends or family. If a student was allowed to take these classes at home, they would have higher quality work because the stress is eliminated due to the lack of a time-crunch.

A public school student has many distractions that can prevent them from doing work efficiently. Thomas Jefferson emphasized the importance of focus by saying, ""The only way to truly learn something is to focus on it entirely, and absorb the knowledge."" A student permitted to learn from home can lead to more success; this is due to the skills they will develop by learning on their own, not guided by anyone else. At home all of the distractions start to become more vague because peer pressure is eliminated. Schooling from home allows students to focus, and do their school work more efficiently.

Some may think online school will make students lazy, but they will learn responsibility as well as other life skills that public schooling does not teach. Online schooling is a great idea for any student because it creates a safe space, time for working, and a less distracting environment. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I believe that students can benefit from attending classes at home. Many students have a safer learning environment when learning at home than at schools. Since majority of students have access to the internet and have computers at home, connecting to online classes wouldn't be an issue. Most students have a hard time waking up early in the morning; if they were to take online classes, students would be able to get more sleep and be able to focus easier. Students can benefit from online learning because they have a more comfortable learning environment and a less stressful schedule.

My first reason to why students would benefit from online classes, is that they have a more comfortable environment. Students can work in their pajamas while doing online assignments, however, if they are in a video conference with a teacher, they must be dressed somewhat appropriate. Being at home can help students be more focused on their work and do much better on assignments. Students will avoid distracting classmates and getting in trouble with their friends when at home. For example, whenever students see their friends, they immediately want to talk and joke around with them, which could lead to them getting in trouble with the teacher. Unfortunately, some students have to deal with classmates that bullies and discourages them, but they wouldn't have to deal with them if they are at home. If students took classes online at home, all these reasons could improve a student's education.

My second reason why students could improve their education through online classes is that they would have a less stressful schedule. Most students like to sleep in, but as long as they complete their assignments the same day, students can sleep for as long as they want. For example, students who attend schools have to a wake up from around 5am to 6am to be on time for school; while students who take online classes can wake up on their own time. Since students don't have to arrive at school; they do not have to worry about missing the bus or be ready when someone to comes pick them up. Most importantly, students may eat meals and snacks whenever they would like and not have to follow their school's lunch schedule. However, students must make sure their computer is charged so they can complete their all assignments.

In conclusion, there are many positive outcomes from attending classes at home than at school. It can be easier for students to focus, they don't have to worry about other students, they can work in pajamas, students can wake up later on, students don't have to worry about missing the bus, and students may eat whenever they like. All of these reasons help prove that students may receive greater benefits from online classes at home.",0,persuade_corpus,2

Additionally, we need to develop effective strategies to motivate ourselves and hold ourselves accountable for our goals. To do this, we must focus on creating an environment that is conducive to progress and success instead of allowing ourselves to be held back by excuses or excuses.

"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:

Pros and Cons of Allowing Schools with Older and Younger Students

As I sit here thinking about the topic of schools with older and younger students, I can't help but think of my own school experience. I've been in middle school for a few years now, and I've seen my fair share of younger and older students. Some schools have programs that allow younger students to attend, while others have programs that allow older students to come in. But what are the pros and cons of these programs, and how can we make them successful?

One pro of having schools with older and younger students is that it can help with socialization. Younger students can learn from older students, and older students can teach them important life skills. For example, older students can teach younger students how to play sports, how to study for tests, and how to be responsible. This can help younger students feel more comfortable in school and make friends more easily.

Another pro is that it can help with academic achievement. Older students can help younger students with their schoolwork, and younger students can learn from older students' experiences. For example, older students can help younger students with math problems, and younger students can learn about the importance of hard work and dedication.

However, there are also some cons to having schools with older and younger students. One con is that it can be difficult for older students to focus on their own schoolwork. They may feel like they have to take care of the younger students, which can be frustrating for them. Another con is that younger students may not take the older students seriously, which can lead to disruptions in the classroom.

To make a successful program, I think schools should have clear rules and expectations for both older and younger students. For example, older students should be expected to help younger students, but they should also be given time to focus on their own schoolwork. Younger students should be taught to respect older students and take their help seriously.

In conclusion, having schools with older and younger students can be beneficial for both groups, but it's important to have clear rules and expectations in place to make the program successful. By allowing older and younger students to learn from each other, we can create a more",1,llama2_chat,2
"It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the trials and tribulations that life throws our way. However, something that we should never forget is the value of a single act of kindness. In the face of difficulty, an act of kindness, no matter how small, can provide some light in the darkness. Even in the toughest of times, small acts of kindness like a smile, lending a hand to a friend in need, or simply being a good listener can be enough to hold onto hope and stay positive. 

When faced with adversity, it can be easy to forget that even the smallest acts of kindness are enough to make a difference. Kindness can help us to appreciate the little moments that make life special. The dawn of a new day, a cool breeze on a summer evening, or the beauty of a sunset can all be enjoyed by reaching out and extending a kind gesture to someone who might be struggling. In doing so, we give them the opportunity to experience a moment of joy and relief.

We are all connected, and kindness has an infinite ripple effect. Kindness isn’t meant to be measured—it’s meant to be shared. As such, no act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. Whether it’s a gesture of tenderness, compassion, or simply a listening ear, kindness is a healing balm to the soul. It has the power to lift us up, keep us positive, and most importantly, seize the day no matter the circumstances.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1

"Dear State Senator,

When our great leaders died they're visions didn't die. They wanted the people to be in charge of who runs there country and what happens in them. Why is this not happening the way our founders wanted it. Having the Electoral College is not a bad idea but, its not a great one. Demolishing the Electoral College is the only fair way.

In the article "" In Defense of the Electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Although it mention how good the Electoral College is it also mentions how ""the Electoral College method of selectin the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carry their state....Knowing their vote will have no effect"". Popular vote don't seem to matter, The Peoples vote don't seem to matter.

Others may argue that the Electoral college helps break a tie but, that only happened one time. If we ever had a issue like that again we could just enforce the Electoral College but, the people the say of who leads us after all we are one nation under god. In the article"" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford plumer states"" Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Furthermore he goes on to say ""  state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Can't we just enforce the Electoral College when we need a tie breaker. The Electoral College consist of five-hundred thirty-eight electors which happens to be an even number. Even if its a slight chance couldn't an Electoral College voting happen to be a tie. The population doesn't have even or odds in this case because every year new people are getting to the age that  they can vote.

In the article ""what is the Electoral college?"" The Office of the Federal Register states that"" the founding fathers establish it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the presidentby a vote in congress and the election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" As you see it says a comprimise not total dictatorship. Everybody has rights voters rights are being tampered with. freedom to vote doesn't seem neccessary because we may have freedom to vote but our votes isn't making a difference. As Plumer said if there is a chance of a tie "" the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president....Because each state cast only one vote ,the single reprsentative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representative from California, who represent 35 million voters.""

"Dear Mr. Principal,

I want you to think about community service and why you want all of the students to participate.

I can see your point of view and how we should all help out and do our share to help the environment.

But what about the students that don't have time to help out.

Like the students that are having trouble at school and they need to focus on their grades so they can get a good education.

Or the kids who's parents are in the hospital and the kids is taking care of the parent and they don't have the time to even worry about themselves.

Personally I can understand why you want everyone to help but you don't need to force us to do this.

Everyone helps out every day even if they don't know it.

Like a girl I know who babysits her neighbors kids every once and a while or even a kid picking up a piece of trash in the school cafeteria.

You might not notice it but we students do a lot of community service.

Actually this Thursday the school is helping out by having a bake sale for a girl who died of cancer and they're raising money for awareness .

Some kids are spending time tonight to bake cupcakes, cookies and other sweets for the bake sale.

While others are staying after school to help sell when they could have been at home on the computer or working on homework.

See we help out on our own when we have time, but if you make all of us participate then we won't be happy and then helping the community will become more like a hassle than something we sacrificed our time for.

I hope you truly understand our point of view and I hope you will give us an option on whether we should help the community, because we all help out in our own little ways.

Yours truly,

"Being able to learn in a stress-free and comfortable environment that has limited distractions would benefit students more than learning in a classroom. Distance learning, a way of attending class via online or video conference, is starting to become a new way for students to attend their classes. Student absences would greatly reduce and more students would overall be present for their lectures. It would also help students who are sick and do not want to get behind in their courses. Students suspended from school will also still be able to participate and do their classwork instead of missing the classes they are gone for and failing because they don't understand the material. So yes, students, and their grades, would vastly benefit from being able to attend classes from home in the form of distance learning.

In the beginning of the first semester student attendance is perhaps at the highest overall percent for that school year up until final exams roll around. Students come in after the nice, long summer break wishing that it could last just a little bit longer; yet they still come to school the first day back ready to jump in and learn. But as the weeks go drag on and they're back into the groove of things, they start to slip and not want to go to school. They start to wake up late, miss the bus, and their parents are unable to take them to school so they end up being absent. Students could also need a break from the crowds and loud clamor of their peers if they are easily overwhelmed or socially anxious. Having distance learning as on option would help these students out immensely. Attendance would go up and more students would be able to be in class from an environment they are comfortable in.

During recent times, more and more students are starting to get sick. Most of the time those illnesses are contagious and they are forced to stay at home so they don't infect others. In other cases, they could have had a medical procedure and wouldn't be able to go back to school immediately. Or perhaps a deadly virus is going around and, in the off-chance that a student would have to be quarantined, they would still be able to be in class if they could not be there due to CDC precautions. An immediate and current example of this would be the CORVID-19 virus, also known as Coronavirus, which has presently needed a few students in the local area to be quarantined when the outbreak first started. They had to miss up to two weeks of school. Because they couldn't show up for health reasons, this is another reason why being able to learn from home would benefit students.

Suspension from school hurts the students more than it helps. Students can miss anywhere from three to ten school days, and in that, miss all the material that the class is learning and won't be able to get instructional help when they get the work, because they don't know or understand it. They end up failing the classes until they can bring the grades up. If anything, being able to do a video conference style learning during suspension should be required so the students wouldn't fail. It would help them understand the material in real time and still be able to ask questions if they don't understand something instead of not doing the work and ultimately getting behind in class.

If problems or situations like these should arise then the use of this new teaching method would bring the attendance average up, keep students in the loop when they are sick or suspended, and therefore, give them more, easier oppertunitities to be active in class and keep their grades up if they are physically unable to be present. With these reasons in mind, distance learning would be a helpful and resourceful option for students.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear Senator Adams,

Voting for a president is not what it seems to be. The electoral college makes the people's votes so that the electors are actually voted. These electors vote for the president in favor of their party which is not always trustworthy or reliable. The popularity winner can also lose, due to lack in electoral votes. Many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In reality, electoral system is outdated and should be tweaked of how it would work today.

To begin with, Electors that are voted for by the people are not always trustworthy. They're hand picked by their politcal party but sometimes,""-state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsiblilties are...""(Does The Electoral). Voters can't control who their electors vote for president. The electoral college should be changed to popularity votes because, ""-(the) electors could always defy the will of people""(The Indefensible Electoral). This is unreliable and the way of voting by the people can be easily swayed by the electors.

Additionally, the popularity winner can lose by having less electoral votes. Voters can be discouraged to elect their president when really the electors do the job. This situation has happened when,""-Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes-""(In Defense Of). Any election, voters can expect another close election in which the popular winner could again lose the presidency. The electoral college is unstable and this major downside is a factor.

More over, many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In this article it states that, ""-voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate""(The Indefensible Electoral). The electoral college does not clarify to voters on what the people are actually voting for. In another article it explains that people actually voted for a slate of electors. This would mean that the author had to reassure the right understanding. Readers of that article who've voted are now in disbelief or shocked.

In conclusion, the electoral college should be addressed to a win by popularity. The electors in favor of their political party are not always trustworthy. The popularity winner can lose due to lack in electoral votes. Also, many voters are confused or don't know how the electoral college works in presidential elections. These facts add on to more cons than pros of the idea of electoral college.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1

"The Face on Mars is a very mysterious thing, but it's only been caught on camera, clearly, once, but that was in the 1970s. The cameras in 1976 were not very clear, as you see they have a 43 meter span per pixel, which makes the picture a whole lot more blurry. Even though it's been seen all over the world as an unknown landform or an alien artifact, the evidence has been seen through, and the face, is, well, not really a face at all.

The Face on Mars was a very popular symbol for the alien conspirators, because they thought that the picture gave solid proof of aliens clearly doing work on the planet Mars. Yet there's a problem, that picture was taken in the 1970s, and if you remember, the cameras weren't all that great. And there have been multiple other pictures taken of the same landformation, like in 1998, and 2001. Yet the picture doesn't depict an Egyption face staring back at you, but a standard, normal, everyday, Mars mesa. The pictures of the face in 1998 showed clearly that the face wasn't quite a face, with a camera 10 times sharper than the original Viking camera, yet the public wasn't satisfied saying how the camera couldn't spot the face out because it was a cloudy time of the year for Mars. Furthermore 3 years later they took more pictures of the exact place of the original siting of the mysterious and erriy face, but once again the cameras do not lie as it unvieled the same blan rock formation, but the press couldn't argue this time. The cameras' span was 1.56 meters per pixel compared to the Viking's 46 meters per pixel, and the planet of Mars was as clear as the eye could see at that time, but there was no unnatural objects to be seen. Yes, it is hard to prove that the famous mesa isn't man-made, you would have to be on the planet to do that, yet the facts and research is all here and it's time to let go.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars has been very iconic on what it has done to the people, and the world as a whole. It's been analyzed and researched over, over, and over again. And it all comes down to the cold hard facts, which all points to the intriging rock of 1976 of being just a rock formation that was, well, lets just say, for now... misunderstood.

"Have you ever asked somebody for their opinion so you can make a choice? Most people ask more than one person and if you're one of those people that's a good thing. Asking only one person for an opinion is not really a bad thing, but that person you're asking might not tell you everything you need to know. Looking for multiple opinions rather than one is better because some people know more then others and you get more information to base your choice off of.

When you're asking somebody for their opinion it's better to ask multiple people because some know more then others. There are some people that will give you a basic four word response because they don't know anything about what you're asking them about. However others have more knowledge or experience. Those people will give you a long response to your question with more information and advice about the choice you're going to make. An example would be buying something and you didn't know if you are getting your money's worth. You could ask different people to see if you're getting a good deal or if you could buy something for the same quality for a lower price somewhere else.

Getting multiple opinions also gives you more information to base your choice off of. If you have more information it will make it easier for you to choose, or it will give you alot more options to choose from. You could put together all the information you got from asking multiple people to help make a better choice for yourself. This relates to me because it helped me pick out a dog when I was younger. It made it easier for me to choose a dog that would be perfect for my lifestyle.

Looking for multiple opinions rather than one is better because some people know more then others, you get more information to base your choice off of. The next time you have a hard time making a choice try asking alot of people for some advice. It gives you more information, and it helps you make a better choice for yourself.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Title: The Power of Trying: Reflecting on Emerson's Wisdom

Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote, ""The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance,"" has resonated with me deeply. As an 8th grader, I've come to realize that this quote is not only applicable to the challenges we face in our daily lives but also to the goals we strive to achieve. Emerson's wisdom highlights the significance of embracing and pushing ourselves beyond our comfort zones in order to grow and succeed.

Personally, I've found that when I've pushed myself to try new things, I've achieved great success. For instance, I joined the school debate team last year, despite feeling nervous and insecure about my public speaking skills. With the help of my teammates and coaches, I worked hard to improve my arguments and delivery. Through consistent practice and determination, I not only became a valuable member of the team but also won several awards in local competitions. Emerson's quote reminds me that by embracing challenges and pushing ourselves, we can achieve great things.

The impact of trying in my example is significant. By pushing myself to join the debate team, I not only improved my public speaking skills but also developed a newfound confidence in my abilities. I learned that with hard work and perseverance, I could overcome my fears and achieve success. This experience taught me the importance of taking risks and trying new things, as it can lead to personal growth and development.

Emerson's quote also highlights the role of embracing change in achieving success. As humans, we tend to resist change, but it's through embracing it that we can truly flourish. By moving with change and joining the dance, we can adapt to new situations and find new opportunities for growth. In my example, joining the debate team required me to step out of my comfort zone and adapt to a new environment. By doing so, I was able to learn new skills and make new friends.

In conclusion, Emerson's quote is a powerful reminder of the importance of trying and pushing ourselves in achieving our goals. By embracing challenges and change, we can grow and",1,llama2_chat,2
"I believe that students should complete summer assignments even when they are not in school, provided that the assignment is provided by the teacher. This is due to the fact that many students would try to create easy assignments to do that require little effort, the assignment would not be relevant to what the teacher had in mind, and that it would be incredibly difficult for the teacher to gauge how much the student was actually learning about the topic chosen.

When students are given the liberty of choosing their own projects, many students will try to create very easy projects that would not challenge them. Summer projects are supposed to be mentally challenging for the student, which would be provided if the teacher designs the assignment. If a student creates the assignment on their own, it would be of a far lower quality of project unless the student was very academically minded, and cares to challenge themselves. Many students see the summer as a time to relax, and not do any work, which while that is a valid point, as students need a break after 9 months of school, as they believe they deserve it, especially after exams are over. The point of summer assignments though is to help a student remain prepared during the summer, as they might forget everything that they need after 3 months off.

Another reason that students should not create their own assignment is that it most likely will not be relevant to what the teacher is expecting. When students are given the freedom to design their own prompts, many would choose topics that they are interested in, such as sports or certain activities, such as going on a walk. Those prompts have a tendency to turn into a 'what I did over the summer' project, which is very likely not what the teacher wants from a student's work. Sometimes a teacher may want that style of project, but more often than not it is more academically minded than that style.

A third reason for a teacher to create summer assignments is that they are most probably being graded, and if a teacher gives the students free reign to invent their own assignments, it will be almost impossible to grade. The style of project would vary greatly, and it would take a teacher far longer to grade than if all of the students were given similar assignments, such as reading a book, and writing an analytical essay on it. What the teacher could do if the students desired a little bit of choice would be to give them several prompts to choose from, and allow the students to then do an assignment based on that. I myself have done summer assignments in that style, and they cause far less problems than from what I've heard from several friends who've had assignments that they get to decide.

Teachers should design assignments to be done over the summer instead of students, because if a teacher is giving the students assignments over the summer, they expect to not have a bunch of random prompts thrown at them, instead they wish to make it very easy to grade, as well as giving the students a challenging yet doable experience over the summer, while at the same time making it relevant to the class that the project is being assigned for.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Requiring community service or extra punishment for students who violate school regulations is an important decision that can have a significant impact on the students and the school community. On the one hand, requiring community service can give students an opportunity to learn valuable skills, while also more generally instilling in them a sense of responsibility to their community. On the other hand, extra punishment, such as suspension, can have a strong deterrent effect, sending a message to the rest of the student body that actions have consequences. 

Having experienced the effectiveness of both approaches while in school, I believe that, for serious violations, suspension is the more appropriate approach. First, it sends a more serious message that violations will not be tolerated, able to shift the culture of a school in a short amount of time. The experience of suspension itself can also help remind students to take their academics and behaviors more seriously, and the lack of attendance may help students target their studies with greater focus. Ultimately, I think that a combination of both approaches is best; mandatory community service and supplements of harsher punishments when warranted provide a system of checks and balances that can be used to effectively deter students from breaking school regulations.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"After the reserch I have done I think that changeing the system would be a good idea because of the following reasons, its not really fair because your not actually voteing for the president, but for a slate of electors, also becuse of the candidates are more focused on the bigg states, and the swing states.

The first reason that changing the system is a good idea is that lots of people think that it is unfair. Like in source 2 by Brandford Plumer, ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John kerry, You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" but if the electors dont win the statewide election he wouldnt get the votes, so its like your vote didn't even count. The winner take all system is unfair because your actualy not choosing your own president.

The next problem are the big staes. The candidates dont spend many time is the small state because they now that those votes won't really help them win so the go to the bigger states where they now they will get more votes. In source 3 by Richard A. Posner says "" a large state gets more attention form presidential candidates in a campain than a small state dose."" For example in 2012 obama won the votes from florida, get got 29 electoral votes. But if he were to go to a small state and won he would only get a few votes, so its not fair for the smaller states and it's not equal.

The finall issue are the swing states. Candidates focus more on the toss-up states. In these states they spend more time and give out more information because in these states the people really pay colse attention to the campain. The candidates dont spend any time int the staes they now they no chances for winning, that why durind the 2000 campain, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all!

In response, based from the followin informatom given I think that The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It should not be the elecotal votes that matter it should be the peoples votes. Also some states dojnt even hear from the candidates because they are busy with the big staes and trying to win over the swing states. If you do change the system you will make lots of people happy and I think that it will work out well for the U.S and everything will be equal.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Hey, I'm like, totally stoked to be writing this essay! 

So, you know, there are like, a ton of career options available for high school students, and it's super important to know about them because, like, your future job is a big deal, you know? 

First off, there's the whole STEM thing. Like, science, technology, engineering, and math are all super important and can lead to some, like, really cool careers. You could be a software engineer, a robotics engineer, or even a nanotechnologist! 

But, like, it's not all about STEM. There are also, like, artistic careers, like graphic design, fashion design, and even video game design!  And, like, don't forget about teaching! You could be a teacher and help shape young minds! 

However, there are also, like, some not-so-great options out there. Like, drug, alcohol, and gang-related problems are, like, super common among teenagers, and it's important to know how to curb them. 

So, like, here's what I would do. First, I would start a program to educate high school students about the advantages and disadvantages of different career options. This could include, like, workshops and presentations from professionals in different fields, as well as, like, online resources and stuff.

And, like, to curb drug, alcohol, and gang-related problems, I would suggest starting a mentorship program. Like, pairing up high school students with older, wiser individuals who can offer guidance and support. And, like, maybe even have some fun activities and events to keep everyone safe and healthy!

"Your principal has decided all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree because now days all kids do is stay home and be on there phones and do nothing. I know that because I used to do the same thing before and i didn't like to do anything at all but then I started playing a sport and it help a lot but i think that. Participating in a extracurricular activity may help you by staying healthy, get you out of trouble,and get you in a good college.

one example is staying healthy by playing a sport you can help prevent a lot of things like maintain a good weight, and keep you from getting sick. Keeping a good weight is good for your health because it keeps you from getting other diseases,more than 1/4 of the people in the U.S. are obese. Why not start at a young age and prevent from being sick and other things. Another thing that can help is eating healthy, we can prevent sickness to in order to do that you might want to think about trying out a new sport.

Another example is getting you out of trouble you can avoid a lot of drama. I learned that social media can get you into a lot of trouble, half of the time a lot of the drama comes from social media. Maybe if you join a club or a sports team you can think before doing something that can get you in trouble. One time my friend made the soccer team but she got in trouble so they kicked her off the team and she learned from her mistake and never got in trouble again. When in your in a cub or playing a sports half of the time you don't have time to be in drama get in trouble.

Last example is joining a club, working on the year book,serve in the student council and, playing a sport can get you into a good college now a days colleges are looking to see if you have participated in any sports or clubs. When i graduate high school i want to go to college and a study to be a general surgeon and participating in a sport or joining a club can help me get into a college. You meed new people when you join new clubs and make new friend ships. When you want to go into a club or in sports do something that you like not something your friends like or something that can help you in life with.

In conclusion staying healthy,getting out of trouble,and going into a new college can help you when you participate in a extracurricular activity. staying healthy by playing a sports and eating healthy can prevent you from getting sick. Staying out of trouble can avoid a lot of drama from school and social media think before you do something your going to regret . Joining a club or participating in a sport can help you get into the college you want and you can meet new people and make new friend ships.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Professor,

I am writing this essay as an eighth-grade student, and my topic is the importance of having a good imagination and knowledge in achieving success. I believe that having a good imagination and knowledge are crucial in achieving success, and I will provide evidence to support my argument.

Firstly, having a good imagination is beneficial because it allows us to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions to problems. It helps us to see things from a different perspective, which can lead to new ideas and opportunities. For example, an artist with a good imagination can create stunning pieces of art that inspire others, while a scientist with a good imagination can come up with groundbreaking discoveries that change the world.

Secondly, knowledge is essential when trying to achieve your goals. Without knowledge, it is challenging to make informed decisions or take the necessary steps to achieve your goals. For instance, when applying for a job, having knowledge about the company and its culture can help you tailor your application and show that you are a good fit for the position. Similarly, when studying for an exam, having knowledge of the subject matter can help you understand the material better and perform better on the test.

Thirdly, achieving your goals requires effort. Success is not handed to us; it takes hard work, dedication, and persistence. For example, becoming a successful athlete requires years of practice and training, while becoming a successful entrepreneur requires taking calculated risks and learning from failures.

Fourthly, an example of the need for imagination and knowledge when applying for a job is when someone wants to become a graphic designer. A graphic designer needs to have a good imagination to come up with creative designs, but they also need knowledge of design principles and software to create effective designs.

Fifthly, the idea of ""quitting one step away from success"" is prevalent in many fields. For example, a writer may have a great idea for a novel but give up before finishing it, or an athlete may lose a race by making a small mistake. However, it is essential to remember that success is not always immediate, and it takes time and effort to achieve it.

Sixthly, an example of how someone's imagination led them to success is the story of Steve Jobs. Jobs had a good imagination and was able to envision a world where everyone had access to a personal",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"I am against driverless cars. There are many problems that could come with these types of cars. If cars like these were produced so many things could enter into effect. I am against driverless cars becuase they can be very dangerous, the productions of the cars would cost alot of money,and there could be serious malfunctions.

One reason that i am against driverless cars is because of the serious safety issues. According to the passage it states that the human driver must stay alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires it. This could cause serious problems. If the driver falls asleep he/she might not hear or feel any alerts. This then could turn into a crash when for example a work zone or a accident appoaches. So many people could be injured.

Secondly, Im against driverless cars because of the cost. These cars will result in spending billons of dollars. What would happen to all of the regular cars? Will they just get thrown away? Throwing away millons of cars would result in mlillons of dollars going in the trash. Can you just add the nessecary parts to make it driverless? If that could happen it would save money, but you would still have to buy the correct parts. What about the cars from the 80's or even the 90's would these cars have the correct parts to make them driverless; If not there goes thousands of dollars going down the drain. Producing the cars would cause serious debt.

Lastly, driverless cars could have serious malfunctions. These cars rely on electricty to keep them going. Say for example we have a serious power outage;think of how many crashes could happen if thousands of cars stopped in the middle of a busy highway. Also think about it electricty and water do not mix; so what happens when it rains or when it snows are the cars still protected. Many malfunctions can occur due to the car having to run off of energy.

So when i hear the words "" driverless cars"". An large some of problems come to my mind. I Think of the many problems that come with it, the lack of saftey, the amount of money spent and wasted and the crazy malfunctions. These are just a few reasons why I am against driverless cars.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Online classes have been gaining in popularity among high school students. Taking online classes from home can provide students with numerous advantages. They can study in their own time, from the comfort of their own home, and can have more control over the speed at which they complete their courses. This increases flexibility and allows students to pursue other activities with the extra time saved, such as participating in extracurricular activities or setting aside more time for leisure.

At the same time, there are drawbacks to taking online classes. Students may have limited access to tutors and course support. They may also miss out on the social and collaborative learning opportunities that traditional classrooms provide. Furthermore, students may lack the motivation and self-discipline to successfully complete an online course.

For example, a student may take an online math course that allows them to complete courses in their own time. This allows them to schedule additional time for extracurricular activities or leisure, such as joining a local sports team or exploring new hobbies. However, they may also be at risk of failing the course if they lack the necessary discipline and self-motivation.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"Starting with the end of World War II, cars have been a cultural hub all around the world, with businesses and even entire economies relying on the production and sale of cars and car products. However, after over sixty years of a car based global economy, the use of cars is beginning to slowly decline. With the decline of car usage, we see decreases in greenhouse gas pollution, a more relaxed living style, and the dawn of a new era of culture and economy around the globe.

Several major cities around the world have attempted to lower car-use through laws or even annual days devoted to reduced car-use. In Vauban, Germany, seventy percent of the population does not own a car, and fifty three percent of that population sold a car to move to Vauban. Vauban has condesed its suburban layout so that everything is within practical walking range for the most part. They have also discouraged car-use by making parking only available in two places, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"" (Rosenthal, paragraph 2). Vauban has reported drastic reductions in greenhouse gases. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting ""car-reduced"" communites in order to cut down greenhouse gas emissions, and legislators are acting on the issue. Experts claim that public transportation is beginning to play a larger role in suburbs, and a larger budget is now being given to public transportation instead of highways. Paris also has reduced driving to reduce smog, but they did it through laws. After suffering record-breaking pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban on driving. On Monday, even-numbered license plates could not drive, or they would be fined twenty two euros, or about thirty one dollars. On Tuesday, the same thing applied to odds. From this driving ban, congestion was lowered up to sixty percent in the French capital. Throughout multiple global cities, these reductions of car-use have had a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and more cities are beginning to join in.

Along with the benifit of reduced greenhouse gases, car-reduced societies also have a more relaxed living style. In Vauban Germany, citizens have claimed that they are enjoying a more relaxed life with much less stress. Heidrun Walter was quoted in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal, paragraph 3). Andrew Selsky's article on car-free days in Bogota, Colombia also states that people enjoy the relief of less stress when they don't use their cars. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife"" (Selsky, paragraph 24). If a drop in car-use leads to a happier, healthier life style, this will most likely set off a cyclicle action of car-use reduction to relief of stress and back to car-use reduction. As more people realize this potential benifit of reducing car-use, more people will beginning to join the population of reduced car-use.

The vast empire of cars that began with the end of World War II has reached its peak and is beginning a steady decline. For nearly seventy years, cars and car products have been a cultural and economical stimulant in both developed and developing countries. From the Model-T to the Buggatti, cars have been percieved as the thing to have over radios, television, and other mass media. Now that they are becoming less used, culture will slowly begin to shift to a different source to hype about. The production of new models of cars and new types of cars will slow and eventually halt all together. As well as culture evolving to a new phase, economy will also undergo major changes. Economy all around the world has been stimulated by auto industries, and international trade has been influenced heavily by it. For example, foreign cars are driven in America more often than domestically-manufactured cars. Now that car-use is declining, the economy will suffer a major crash in stocks in the auto industry. Although this crash will harm the economy, the ever-changing population of Earth will quickly find some new innovation to obssess over and the market will quickly recover and improve on this new product. With a new culture and economy, the world will be in a new era, a new age of living.

With the decline of car usage, we see decreases in greenhouse gas pollution, a more relaxed living style, and a possibilty of a new era of culture and economy around the globe. As the problems with cars are found, people have and will continue to resolve the problem by reducing car-use. The Earth will become healthier with a nicer atmosphere, the population will lead happier lives, and culture itself will transform with the end of major car-use.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"There are many reasons I can think of why people need more than one persons advice and some are life changing. In the next few paragraphs I will explain the reasons I can think of why you need multiple peoples advice. Although I feel I need to clarify why we need advice in general. Advice is mainly helpful for learning, also it can help those who don't see what they should do, but if you got bad advice it might effect your whole life. Now that I've clarified that, time to continue with the question.

First reason, multiple viewpoints on the topic or compare and contrast. Now this reason would probably apply to someone who is seeking advice before a decision. An example of this reason : Generic_Name needs a new bike,so he goes in the bike shop and ask his friends for advice on which bike he should get and they do now. Generic_Name goes to the counter and the cashier gives him some advice so now he can compare and contrast the bikes in his head and decide which one to get. In the example Generic_Name has three point of views on the different bikes so he could easily make a choice. This is like research but from people who have done the research. Also Advice comes from friends and family mostly so you Know it isn't bad advice.

Second reason, bad advice. when you get bad advice you what to get more advice from some one else or maybe you don't even know if it is bad advice that is why always get more than one person to get advice from. Now for an example: You just turned twenty and you're still living with your parents so you go to your bad friend house because you think he has cool job probably. So you get to his house then ask him and he says you could join my gang we do cool things and get a lot a money you think about talking to your other friend but then you say yes anyway. The next day you go to jail for murder because your friend comited murder to rob a bank. You were sitting in a car waiting for your friend to get out of the bank you didn't think that he hurt or robed anyone. Now you in prison for forty years and your friend for life. When you were about to get your good friends advice you didn't but if you did you would realize how bad of an idea that is and would of been fine, so never be to careful.

Now I could list a few more but these are the main ones and most important. The first reason is useful and the second is for your safety. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Phones and Driving

The use of cell phones while operating a vehicle should not be allowed. Today in society people do not realize how much cellphones have affected the way people drive. It is and it has been a danger for a while now. There are many dangers due to the use of cell phones most people do not realize that they really are.

To begin with, the majority of car accidents that happen everyday are usually caused by people who are using their cell phones while driving. They tend to use their cell phone while being on the road thinking they can multitask when in reality they can't. People do not realize the kind of accident they can cause by replying back to a text or just reading one. That one simple reply can take someone else's life in a blink of an eye. Once it happens there is no going back, it's not like a message where you can delete or go back to that one specific text.

In fact, using your cell phone is a bad choice to do while driving on the road. There are people with kids in their car trying to get back home or on their way to spend time with some family. Most of these people do not make it back home or to their destination due to either a car accident caused by people who are distracted on their phone. There are children who do not know that a simple phone they use to watch videos on is a bad thing for them. Not only is it a bad thing but it can cause serious outcomes to anybody who is just driving and going on with their life.

To tell the truth, the use of cellphones while driving is illegal in most places. People can get a ticket and get fined for doing so. There are many penalties that people can receive from getting a ticket. For example, some may pay the fine and get demerit points to your license. These demerit points provide a balance and check anyone's driving; they are either added or subtracted from your license. These point vary based on the type of convictions you get. If you go over the number of demerit points based on the type of license you have your license may be suspended. People need to know that you will get a consequence for using your cellphone while driving. It may not seem like a big deal but in the real life it is.

As a final point, the use of any type of cell phone should not be allowed by anyone who is driving. No one really knows the kind of danger cell phones be putting people in. Yes it's a small device almost as big as the size of your hand but it can cause a serious accident. Cell phones may not seem like a big deal to people nowadays but in reality they can be deadly.         ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Our facial expressions can tell someone a lot about how we feel about something or situations in our lives, sometimes even better than verbal communication. Being able to read these expressions and change the environment around us could help the human race acheive the goal of becoming monumentally more happy people. Throughout the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author mentions many studies and facts relating to the Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to identify human emotions. This would be very useful in the classroom because the studies shown have very intelligent figures present, the article includes a thourough explanation about how the FACS operates and succeeds, and how the technology could improve the willingness to learn and the ultimate goal of maintaining happiness.

First of all, in paragraph 6, the diction in the paragraph and the implementation of an interview with an intelligent figure relating to the product prove that this machine could make a vital difference in a classroom-style learning environment. For exmaple, author Nick D'Alto interviews Dr. and Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang works with other professors such as Nicu Sebe on the FACS, and in this pragraph he states many important facts about how computers could alter the learning environment based on how the student feels. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

Being able to modify a lesson for a single student rather than an entire group could make a huge difference. Rather than the teacher having to chage the whole lesson for the entire class, the computer could ""read"" and individual student's face and effectively personalize the lesson for that student alone. This technology could supply a much needed change to the sometimes ineffective teaching of an instructor.

Also, in paragraphs 7 and 8, detailed instructions are given on how the machine works and how it can detect fake emotions from real emotions. For example, at the end of paragraph 7, the author states the difference between the muscle movements in a real and fake smile. He then states how the machine looks for the muscle movements and formations of a real smile rather than those of a fake one. Also, in paragraph 8, even more examples of differences in muscle formation are used to show how the technology will in fact work in a classroom environment. The differences between a fake and real smile may seem like an easy task to distinguish in real life, and it may appear to be a problem for a machine. However, the information written by D'Alto from the interview with Dr. Huang show that the machine will have no problem distinguishing a real, genuine happy smile from a fake, intentionally deceiving grin. Therefore, a student could not effectively trick the machine into changing a lesson in a classroom environment.

Finally, in paragraph 9, a study on facial expressions and their relation to emotions is cited. In this study, many important ideas about feelings carried out by humans are stated with truthfulness and security. For example, the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion states that moving your facial muscles can not only express emotions, but can even help produce them. This states that real emotions can occur from just making a face. Even if the person who was making the expression originally was not feeling that emotion, they may in fact feel that way after one small change in their expression. Also, the author references a ""renowed drama coach,"" Constantin Stanislavsky, who states that he forced his actors to reproduce the actions of smiling and frowning so they genuinely feel happy or sad when on stage. Overall, a change in one small part of your face can change how you feel, and if this technology is implemented into classrooms throughout America, that one small change could alter the way students feel about learning.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), as mentioned in Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" could be used in classrooms to successfully ""read"" the faces of students, alter the lesson in some way just for them, and make sure each student is happy with what they are hearing and seeing. If this technology is implemented into classrooms around the globe, students will be more excited about their learning experiences, possibly receive much improved grades, and be more happy people in gerenal. If the faces of the next generation are happier than ever, what's to come afterword could be even better.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"In cities such as Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, people are getting serious about cutting down on the vast usage of cars. The ""car free"" trend is beginning to spread throughout the world, and even to places in America. By limiting car usage, the state of the environment improves, a more healthy lifestyle is promoted, and opportunities for other innovations are brought into the light.

In Paris, a driving ban was enforced to help clear the air of polluants. This ban lowered the congestion by 60 percent, and according to reporter Robert Duffer, ""The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gasses in Europe, and up to 50 percent in areas where cars are used more often, such as the United States. The Environmental Protecion Agency is promoting car reduced communities in America, where even legislators are beginning to act. By elimitating cars from the everyday equation, one also eliminates the greenhouse gasses and other pollutants, which makes the planet a healthier place to live.

With less and less cars being utilized, there are more opportunites for people to get active by biking, walking, and participating in other active means of getting from point A to point B. According to news reportes Andrew Selsky and Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occassional distant moter"", and ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" Without cars, citizens are encouraged to get active. Condensed cities allow people to walk to their destination, which drastically improves an individual's heart health, along with aerobic activity such as biking.

An official from Transportation for America says, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Sociologists believe that America has passed peak driving, and cars are no longer the focus of improvement. The Internet makes telecommuting possible, which is much more convenient than using automobiles because people can feel connected without the drive. This and the rise in cellphones implies that while innovations used to be focused on transportation, telecommuting is the new big thing.

With many areas participating in the eventual elimination of automobiles, many are following suit. Sociologists believe that cars will eventually disappear. By cutting down on our usage of cars, we help the enviromnent, promote health, and focus innovations elsewhere.                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"When fossil fuels are burned up it causes severe harm to the atmoshpere and is harzadous to society and everything around us .

There are many disadvantages and advantages for using any type of veichle and burning up fossil fuels . Cars can take you wherever you desire faster than any other type of land transportation but in the process of traveling in your car, your car is in the action of burning fossil fuels that later on will turn into harmful gas which hurts the enviroment around us . Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, drving less and getting fewer licenses each year . Every year we should decrease the amount of cars being used because excessive car usage can be a big hit to the atmoshpere and your wallet . There are more advantages of limiting car usage than disadvantages because humans dont really need cars to naviagte their way in life.

Excessive amount of car usage can be really harmful as well to the people driving on the streets . There are likely more accidents if the population of cars on the streets increase because if one tiny crash occurs and the streets are over popluated that one tiny crash can now become a huge crash with the other vechiles around it . Cold nights in France and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and due to this lots of smog was created and the roadways were shut down to its lack of vision , this could've been provoked if diesel fuel was'nt over used in France. Limiting car usage is a great factor because there so if it happens , less car accidents will occcur , the action of global warming will decrease , money being spent on gas will decrease and our atmoshphere would'nt be all gassed up with burned fossil fuels .

Many people also suggested that everyone should cut down the car usage and all the fossil fuels being burned up because it causes lots of stress , Heidrun Walker is a mother of two and a media trainer stated ""When i had a car i was always tense . I'm much happier this way."" As a result to Walkers statement , many people agree with her because when you have a car you have to worry about buying gas and what if you dont have money for gas, what if you dont make it on time and you need to go pick up your child , there are so many ''what if's'' and problems when having a car . When not having a car you can save up lots money in your bank account , you can take care of the atmoshpere by not burning and using up fossil fuels and you can decrease the percentage of you getting into a severe car accident .

Limiting car usage brings alot of advantages to yourself and everyone around you and also some disadvantges . Many people can benefit from not having or limit the car usage because it can save you lots of money and take care the enviroment your living in . There are many solutions to get somewhere rather than using a car that when using fossil fuels to harm the atmosphere it raise the percentage of global warming .  Limiting car usage can help save the planet , cause less deaths around the world , save money , reduce the percentage of global warming and allow living things to breath oxygen and not harmful gasses that can hurt the respiratory system .

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Many students have a grade C average, which is not that bad for an average. A grade C average is still a passing grade. To many people, sports and other activities is what helps students get them through troubles that they may have at home. Many times, sports raise people's self esteem and that could be how they are passing even though it's just on the edge of a passing grade. It is very important that everyone has something that they can rely on to make them happy and feel like they are important. Some students think about their sports and activities when they need something to give them the energy to stick up for what they believe in and realize how important it is to make the most out of the life that you have. That happened to me. I joined band this year and I now speak from my heart and I try my best to treat everyone with care. My first day of band everyone was so nice to me and they helped and made me feel like I've always been part of the band and they included me in everything. That activity has taught me to be a caring person and make the most of what I can and not act like someone I'm not. So, please consider allowing students with a C average to participate in sports and other activities. Sports and other activities are not just something people do for fun but, also to help them become a better person, themselves. Thank you so much!

"Dear Principal

Many students might have a' C 'as an overall average, but taking away sports isn't really fair, because every kid needs exercise to keep their mind and body healthy. Grades are important, but so is the need to exercise. I could understand the fact of kid aren't putting enough effort into their work but what if its not their fault what if their trying their best but they don't have any encouragement from their guardians

A possible solution is the student with an average of a 'B ' should get a more variety of activities available, that way everyone get all the exercise , needed. Most of those grade 'C' students are just having a hard time , they shouldn't be punished for doing their best they should just spend some time reviewing simple mistakes they have made in the past.

Lastly, taking exercise won't only make you unhealthy it . Makes your mind unable to work to its fullest extent . For some people doing activities such as basketball, baseball, and football allows them to relieve their selves to clear their head to be able to focus on the main task at hand. I hope my reasoning will persuade or atleast give you second thought on changing the school policy. I am one of many students who believe it is wrong to change the school policy .

"Dear principle,

I think you should allow students to use their phones during lunch and other free times as long as we have them off during class time. People have them on during class anyway. If you let students use phones during lunch they will be less tempted to use them during class.

The first reason why you should let students use phones during lunch is that they like you more. If you give people what they want they will like you. Would you rather have people like you or hate you? Well if you want people to like you than let them use their phones at lunch.

The second reason why you should let kids use their phones is that they wont use them in class. If they can use phones at lunch they wont get in trouble for using them in class. The parents wont hate if their kids don't get in trouble.

That is why you should allow kids to use their phones at lunch. If you don't let them then shame on you.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Have you ever wondered about space travel? Maybe even on planets that might be closer than it seems? What if it was one of them in The Milkyway Galaxy? You might be thinking about Mars but you may think too yourself ""We've already explored alot of Mars."" But what if I told you that Venus is the planet we are talking about visting? The author in the article, "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" agrees with exploring one of our planetary neighbors Venus. It's conciderd Earth's 'twin', We have tecnology that can help us explore the planet, and that studying Venuses atmosphere atmosphere can help us lern more abut our sister planet.

Venus is known for being one of Earth's ""twins"". Venus is known for it's density and size that is quite similar to Earth's. ""Astronomers are facinatedby Venus beacuse it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported forms of life, just like Earth."" (Paragraph 4, Challenges of Exploring Venus). Astromomers are saying that venus is very similar to Earth, by its size and that in the past Venus might have had life forms on it and that might be a good reason why it would be a good reason to explore Venus.

Another reason why exploring Venus would be a good idea is that we have the proper tecnology to go and explore our sister planet. ""NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to go study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray... blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape."" (Paragraph Five, The Challenge of Exploring Venus). With the tecnology to be able to fly over Venus and using a blimp to help humans fly over the harsh conditions of Venuses surface. So we have the right tecnology to fly over Venus and safely get humans from Earth to our sister planet Is another reason why we should start exploring Venus.

A final reason why we should explore Venus is that we know about Venuses weather and condisons are harsh and we know how to help explore the planet. "" a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide and clouds are highly containing sulfuric acid... Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like errupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting stricks to probes seeking land on it's surface."" ( Paragraph 3, The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Scinetist are discovering Venuses waether like conditions and the planet's conditions. With knowing these we can make tecmology that can help us explore the planet. And we can study these weather conditions and learn more about our sister planet.

So traveling to Venus is a good idea to travel to Venus even though the conditions on the planet are not so welcoming and the resaoning for traveling there is that, the planet is Earth's ""twin, we have the correct tecnology to travel there and we know a lot of the planet's atmosphere and how we can take that to help make human travel safe to get from Earth to venusand how we can help humans survive the conditions that come along with Venus. Traveling to venus would also futher our minds on how our neghboring planets are. Do you think that traveling to Venus would help humanity as a whole?     ",0,persuade_corpus,1

You can get more time out of class and go around the school and probably get one for free . And after you get all the pictures you can go print them out put them in the book.

If you serve on the student council you can help new people around the school. Also help people in other class rooms with stuff . Make sure that kids stay out of trouble and dont get suspend and make sure they clean up be hide themselves and keep them away from bad.

I think its ok to do sports because yo can go to the pros . If you work hard on the yearbook you could you could get your own for free. if u do good as student council you will most likely get principal list and get rewardes.

"Stress, work, jobs and injuries. Some students have all of that on their shoulders: responsibilities that they need to take care of in, and outside of school. Students can't always focus on academic studies, or activities. They have other things to do, like babysitting a child, working a job, healing themselves physically and mentally. Therefore, students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students, just like some adults, have things they need to do after their 'job' is over. These things include working a job, picking up a sibling from school, or running errands for their guardians. And even if students didn't have anything thing to do after the last bell of the day rings, they shouldn't have to stay long. It should be the students choice to what they want to do, whether it's just to go home and relax, or go out with friends. School generally limits our free time and social time. Therefore, students shouldn't be force to limit their seven to eight, or more, hours of time they have to do what they want.

Besides not having time to do what students want, there's stress. Stress is like a child kicking over an anthill. It takes students long to become stress free, and stress randomly comes at times. Whether that random stress is studying for a test or class, worrying about keeping up grades, and doing homework on time. So the last thing a student needs is a child, stress, destroying their anthill. Basically what I'm saying is that requiring students participation in extracurricular activities will overflow students with stress, and eventually, they might become too overwhelmed. The mind is a fragile thing, and should be taken care of with care, just like the body. Students can't do certain activities if their body is injured. And for the some activities that they can do, the student just may want to heal fully instead of jumping back into school and receiving more stress. With that, students should decide what they want to do.

Extracurricular activities will benefit students, that is what some people may say. While I do agree some extracurricular activities will benefit students who choose to be apart of it, it may not do good for others. What good would it do for you to be apart of something that your hearts not in? Yes, it's nice to experience new things, but some experiences aren't for some people. Besides that, students have a life outside of school. They can't be expected to have school as their only responsibility. They have things that need to be done, and things they want to do. With that in mind, the students who want to be apart of after school activities should, and those who don't shouldn't have too.

Opportunities are a great thing for students, but those opportunities shouldn't be required of students to take them without any choice at all. Students have tons of responsibilities they need to attend to either way. Therefore, more stress is unneeded in the long run. In conclusion, students have a lot to stress about, free time they want, injuries to heal, jobs to be worked. So please consider the idea that students shouldn't be forced into doing extracurricular activities when it could hinder them.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Driverless cars are very unecessary and will only cause trouble that can be avoided. These cars are unecessary, because driving is not one of the huge problems in the world. A lot of other issues should be viewed as more urgent to take care of, than the development of cars that do not need people behind the wheel and in control. They will only cause problems, because they can easily get into accidents, among many other issues. It was just spoken about this week in the news: Google's car got into its first accident.

In order to completely transfer over to driverless cars, a lot of things have to be changed and developed. Not only are the cars themselves problematic (they are not even able to react around an accident site), but there are no laws stating who is responsible if a vehicle with no driver causes an accident to happen. Who is held responsible in the end? A prediction some can make is that many lawsuits will be formed against both the maker of the vehicle, and the driver behind the wheel. The question will also arise that if neither were in control, can you blame something such as a car? Another problem that the cars could create, is a huge spending issue. In the article it is stated that a certain device ""cost two hundred million dollars."" That is a lot of money to spend on the system for one car. And the cars need many sensors in order for them to run smoothly, such as,"" a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors,"" and that might be roughly half of all one car needs. Another problem that could arise is the conditions of roads. Many of the driverless cars that the article states have been developed have needed specific conditions in order to function correctly, such as ""a special test track"" or ""magnets with alternating polarity."" How would those cars function in an everyday situation out on the open road? Not very well. So how would they be able to develop a vehicle that can operate on a true highway, as well as on the many other types of roadways in the world? An issue that should be brought up also, is that none of the developed vehicles have been completely driverless. They need humans to do certain things for them behind the wheel, such as navigating crash scenes. What happens if a driver who is bored while their car drives for them forgets to be paying attention?

In conclusion, driverless cars are not something that should be stood for. They will only create trouble that is not needed in the world, and can possibly lead to way bigger issues, such as in our economy. The development and actual distribution of these cars would be something unprecedented and who knows what could come of unprecedented things. In reading this article, it was easy to pick out things that could go wrong, and reasons it would not be in the world's best interest to go further in the development, but it was a lot harder to pick out what could go right and how these cars could help the world.

"Wow, this is such an amazing opportunity! As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to research and write about one of the most iconic football clubs in the world - Barcelona FC! 🏈🔥

First of all, let's talk about the history of Barcelona FC. The club was founded in 1899 by a group of football enthusiasts, and since then, it has grown to become one of the most successful and beloved teams in the world. From its humble beginnings in the Spanish Second Division, Barcelona has risen to become a global powerhouse, winning numerous domestic and international titles, including five Champions League trophies! 🏆

Now, let's talk about some of the changes that Barcelona FC has undergone since its formation. One of the most significant changes has been the club's shift towards a more youthful and diverse team. In recent years, Barcelona has prioritized developing young talent from its own academy, rather than relying on expensive transfers from other clubs. This has led to the emergence of talented players like Ansu Fati, Pedri, and Gavi, who are already making waves in the football world. 🔥👀

Another major change at Barcelona FC is the increased focus on marketing and branding. The club has expanded its reach through various channels, including social media, merchandise, and even theme parks! 🎢🏆 It's crazy to think that a football club can have its own theme park, but hey, it's working for Barcelona! 😅

Moving on to the salaries of players, it's no secret that Barcelona FC has some of the highest-paid players in the world. Lionel Messi, the club's captain and arguably the greatest footballer of all time, earns a whopping $50 million per year! 💸🔥 Of course, not everyone can afford to pay these salaries, but it's clear that Barcelona FC is willing to invest in its players to ensure their success on the pitch. 🏆

Now, let's talk about how players get into joining Barcelona FC. It's no",1,llama2_chat,4
"High school can get very stressful and overwhelming sometimes. Video conferencing and work online are some ideas for teens who are ready for that next step. And we are up for that. This is beneficial because they're able to supply their own food,have more freedom,and gain better concentration. Therefore,students should be able to attend classes from home.

School food can become very gross after a while and eating the same lunch every two to three weeks can get very old. During school, they give you a time limit for when to go and when your time is up. The staff in the cafe will only serve you one plate per lunch and if you don't have the right stuff on your tray then therefore you have to go back in the line and pick up what they tell you. Some students have to pay to even eat lunch and if you dont have money you can't eat. However, if classes were taught at home they would have every thing they could possibly wish for.

Everyday staff members are yelling and demanding us to go to class, or to not wear a specific type of clothing, and tell us we can't listen to music. If you disobey any of these rules your consequence could either be out of school suspension or detention. These type of consequences goes on your record and can possibly effect your career after school. While at home, anything you wear doesn't matter as long as your fully dressed, who wouldn't want to go to class in their pj's! Me personally, enjoy listening to music while working because it helps me stay focused and get things done faster. These students should be able to have their freedom and worry about nothing.

Some think distance learning is not beneficial however,students should be able to attend classes online and join a video conference. Students that attend public schools don't have the right to do the things that students from home do. Teens however tend to have very bad anxiety when it comes to going to a school with a bunch of other students. Anxiety starts around the age 14-18 and can go on for a various of time. This argument should be dealt with over a conference to discuss whether or not students don't agree with classes at home.

In conclusion,students should be able to attend a class or video conference at home and finish all four years from there. All students should be able to supply their own food and have freedom while accomplishing this task. I agree with students being able to benefit their learning from home.       ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"With the thriving success of evolving technology, there is no question as to why schools shouldn't also keep up with the time. The idea of online learning as an alternative to in-school learning is very new. This may be the start of something revolutionary that contributes to the process of learning. Therefore, schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class because it is a faster alternative, an easier way to learn, and students are able to pace themselves.

Distance learning may be a faster alternative for students who are currently enrolled in normal schools. With experience from the Generic_School Hybrid Program, there is not as much content within these virtual classes. With less work it would allow for students to complete classes faster. There would also be a lot less stress put into completing these assignments, which would allow them to complete this work at ease. Working ahead could also be another possibility. Proactive students love to complete work earlier to reduce stress that may come in the future. By working ahead, students are able to learn the material provided a lot faster; which would reduce the amount of time needed to complete a course. As time goes on, we strive to complete certain tasks at a faster speed, therefore, distance learning may be a perfect alternative.

A new way of learning may also allow certain students to learn at more ease. Certain learners may classiy themselves as visual learners; those who need to see something to learn it. With the lack of a live lesson conducted by a teacher, a visual such as a PowerPoint or video would be provided. With the presence of these factors, visual students may learn more easily at home rather than in school .Also, with the fact that there would not be other students involved in the classroom, it could eliminate the factor of distraction. For some, it is difficult to learn with others who are disruptive. Therefore, the elimination of this problem would allow students to learn without distractions, reducing their ability to learn. Students have no choice as to what they are exposed to in a classroom environment, therefore, a visual and calm environment may benefit them.

By doing these courses at home, students may be provided the opportunity to pace themselves. Teenagers have very busy lives that include sports, jobs, and chores. Therefore, by being able to pace themselves, they would learn the material but also be allowed time to do their other activities. It would be a perfect balance of school and other activities. Along with balance, students would also learn the importance of time management. They would need to reserve time in order to complete these assignments in a timely manner. Time management is a skill that may benefit those who may acquire certain jobs in the future. Allowing one to pace them self would help them learn the skill of time-management and how to balance their lives with school

With the advancing times, virtual school has become a possibility for a few students around the world. If one had problems in a normal school facility, online school should be a possibility to consider. These problems which a lot of students suffer from include distractions, time consumption, and difficulty learning. Therefore, the choice of enrolling in distance learning options should be offered at schools because they are a faster alternative, an easier way to learn, and they allow students to pace themselves.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Everyday humans make thousands of choices, some minor, some life changing, but they never know if they chose the best options. Choices are difficult to make and you always wonder what the outcome of the other choice is. When most people can't decide about a decision they ask multiple people for their opinion on what to do. This pattern of asking around for decisions is very common and is quite helpful to make a better choice. Asking multiple people for their opinions on a decision can help you make a better choice by giving you new information to consider before making a choice, supplying different viewpoints and takes to choices, and giving more trustworthy results than just asking one person.

When you ask multiple of your peers about your decision, their insights will be useful information for you to consider to help you make your choice. In 4th grade, I couldn't decide between going to two theme parks for my birthday, Kings Dominion, or Six Flags. I asked a handful of my friends about which theme park was better and they all replied with useful information about which roller coasters they likes best and their personal experiences with those two parks. Peer insight is a key factor in helping you with a choice, as peers give you information to consider that make deciding a lot easier. Asking multiple people for their opinions can and will help more than just asking one friend, or asking no one at all. The thoughts and opinions of your peers can be very helpful factors in making a decisions, and asking for the opinions of your peers can be crucial to you making the best choice.

Asking different people what they think about a choice will naturally produce different sides and opinions on the topic. Different viewpoints are good for helping you to decide on a choice. When you have different angles and sides to consider, you can look at things differently and consider all sides of what the choice means. different views can help guide you to a better choice since you can analyze each view and decide which is more favorable to you. Your peers giving different views lets you think about the pros and cons to each decision and helps you to properly choose the better choice. Asking different people for their takes and views of your decision can be a very helpful thing to do as that can lead you to the better choice in your decision.

Asking multiple people for advice on your decision is much better than asking just one friend since multiple opinions can give you better information to choose the best choice. When you only have a single opinion to go off of, you aren't given room to choose since you only have backing for one side and don't know anything about the other side. However, with multiple opinions you have lots of information on both sides of the decision and you can justly choose the better answer. Multiple opinions are a very important factor in decisions and only having one may not help at all. The more people you ask for opinions about the topic, the easier it will be to choose the better answer. In the 4th grade theme park decision I described earlier, I stated that people gave me their experiences and opinions on it to help me choose a theme park. If I had only asked one person about their experiences, I might not have known much about one of the theme parks. Since I did ask multiple of my peers, I was able to form a better understanding of both theme parks and choose the better one. Having multiple opinions rather than just a single one is extremely important in choosing and finding the better option and making the best possible choice.

Asking more than one person for their opinion can help you make a better choice in a decision because multiple opinions give you information you need to consider, gives you differing angles and sides to the situation, and gives more reliable information over just one opinion. Peers can give you information to consider that helps you pick the best choice. Multiple angles to the decision can help you find the pros and cons of each outcome and find which choice you would want to make. Multiple opinions give you lots of information that can be used to pick a better choice, which is much better than the information that you would get from a single opinion. Asking for multiple opinions when you need help with a choice is a smart idea as it does help you to choose the best choice that is offered.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Summer vacation is what every student looks forward to throughout the school year. Many students plan to go on trips with their family or friends for months at a time, but are limited to the three month vacation. The last thing a student wants to worry about over break is getting school-work done.

But in order to make sure that students don't forget whatever they learned during the nine months that school was in session, teachers assign a summer assignment or project.

Although student-designed projects would be liked more by the student, teacher-designed projects are meant to follow the criteria of the course and make sure that the assignment is reasonable, while student-designed may only cover one-fifth of their learning. But a student-designed summer project lets the teacher see what kind of student are taking their class, their level of creativity, and what the teacher needs to cover.

It's the teachers' job to teach students so that they can be successful in whatever they chose to study in college or universities. It's their job to ensure that the student has learned the standard learning criteria and maybe even more. Teacher-designed assignments are made to make sure that the students have some idea of what the course will be like, so that on the first day of class, students can engage themselves in the discussion. For example, if a student decides to take a new course that they have never taken before, they must have some background knowledge when coming to class on the first day. A summer assignment will help them figure out what they should already know coming into the first day. Students are not aware about all they information they need to know, and if they design the project themselves, they could miss majority of the information, so it's important that the teacher designs the project, even if it's a lot of work, it will be beneficial for the student in the long run.

The main thing teachers are trying to do is help guide students on their path of success, but only if the student complies. The point of a project is to let students explore a topic that the teacher can teach themselves, but a hands on experience can better the students' learning. If students in the class decide to create their own different projects, they won't all be retaining all of the information that is required to get out of doing the project and some projects might not be relevant to the topic. For example, if a chemistry teacher decides to create a project for students to learn about Intermolecular Forces and wants the students to learn about Dipole-Dipole, Hydrogen Bonding, London Dispersion Forces, and gives the students no rubric so they chose how the project will be done, some students will find all three forces and learn a lot, while others may only find one or two, and worst comes to worst, students didn't even follow the directions and created their own project separate from the information given. This is important because the teacher will end up having to teach the students what they missed in the project which will take out of class time to learn other things.

As much as students dislike the thought of school during summer vacation, they can't let all of the hard work and studying they did throughout the school year go to waste because they ""don't feel like"" doing any work. But that's where summer assignments come into play. Summer assignments are designed to help the student stay familiar with what they learned. Teacher-designed projects are good because it makes sure that the student learns everything correctly, however a student-designed project allows for the teacher to get familiar with the students work habits, and so the teacher knows what they need to go over within the first weeks of school. For example, if a student is signed up for a computer science class, for the summer assignment, the student gets to chose what they want to do, as long as it is coding related. There will be various projects, some will be fully developed programs, which will show the teacher that the student has coded before, and some will be a short code that can calculate a user's input. This is important because it's gives students a chance to be creative and to show the teacher that they are ready for the class in the fall. Also it can be fun for the students to create something which will make them want to complete it.

Teachers have gone through school just like their students to be able to help even more people become successful. Teachers only want the best for their students, so when they assign something it will always be beneficial to the learning process. Even if the assignment is very hard and long, teachers are there to provide help when needed. Teacher-designed projects may benefit more than student-designed projects because it follows a strict rubric on what should be the outcome of the learning experience. While student-designed projects become something that is disorganized and uses up more class time than it should. But students may appreciate the projects teachers assign if they got to have a say in what the rubric is. If the teacher and students come to an agreement, it can increase the students participation and make the project learning time more enjoyable. Ultimately, teacher-designed projects benefit the time spent and the amount of information received, with the help of student input, the participation from students will have a greater impact on the learning of the students.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"I think yes, it can help students with their feeing becuase my first reason is becuase emotions matter alot. My seconed reason is becuase reason a article can halp people feel better if they pay good attions to what the story says. my last reason is becuase showing feelings they the way we look.

My first reason it can help students becuase by the way people read the story and look at the foto there is a lot of ways to look and read it. If there is a person who really is feeling sad they can read a story that has a lil og exititing moments on the story and with happy pictues that shows the feelings of the story. It can help alot beuase by looking at the pictuce and really paying attintion to the story it can grab the readers attintion. Once th author got the readers attiontion the reader is going to be focesed of what the book is about and going to make them change their feelings.

My seconed reason by reading the article it can change feelings. It can make then get into the feeling they want to get into eather it can be mad, sad, happy scared, exited, ect. There is a lot of feeling people can get into if they into what the author want to tell them by reading.

My last reason is by the way they look. Not alot of the people show they way they feel. If people dont show how they feel it becuase most of the idea is becuase hey are holding there feelings down deep in them. If they not showing it most people say they dont show it because they dont want to make people worry becuase they are in a bad mood and just dont want to get bothered. They try to show they are stong but deep dow they are holding a hard feelings they they going to remember at some other time becuase they are heoding it in them and they are the people who just dont want to do stuff at a surten time. The people who show there feeings i think they are the people who have the most good time becuase they get rid of that feeling.

"Do you think drivers should use their phone at any capacity while driving? Some people may think different but I think it's very dangerous. There have been 3,153 injuries, and 424,000 deaths dealing with texting while driving. Texting while driving has been happening all over the world, and for many many years since the cell phone has been made. It also takes away the perception of the road meaning everyone would be taking their eyes off the road. Social media is another liability while texting in the car.

Having the phone while driving has been a daily part of life since the phone was invented in 1972. Texting while driving has been a part of daily life since messaging was put into use on the cell phone. People urge to text and drive because once they get that first text they don't want to stop replying. ""Texting while driving and other bad behaviors have fueled a spike in motor vehicle deaths in Georgia and across the nation over the past two years"".

People don't understand the dangers and necessities of keeping your eyes on the road, because the death rate continues to go up and on one care to change it.

There are many different types of phones all across the world not even in the United States alone. ""The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that 80% of all car crashes are related to driver inattention"". There are overall seven state with bans on cell phones in the hand while driving. No one understands why everyone all over the world desires to keep their phone in their hand at all times be it always happens. Even when there is a passenger in the car for example a Jamaican man and his family he would sometimes still text and drive if he wife weren't in the car.

No one can see while you're looking at your phone that's the reason while everyone is crashing on the road now a days. Texting is in one of the top ten categories of the most dangerous causes of death in the U.S lone. Technology in vehicles are causing drivers to be on the phone as well taking their eyes off the road. Looking at your phone cause the driver to either hit a bystander or an animal. ""Statistics state that on average, 9 of these daily fatalities are related to distracted driving"".

No matter what everyone should just put the phone down while driving because everyone would be even more safe.

In conclusion there are many different views on whether the phone should be allowed in the car while driving. There are many problems with phones being in cars and since it has been made accidents are still going to happen. Cars are being totaled, lives are being lost, and people are being injured because of phone and driving. Sometimes many would think if the phone wasn't invented would the death rate have stayed the same or would everything be different. Phones don't need to have that big of an impact of people's lives because that's not good or healthy for any body's life. Phone shouldn't be allowed in these days, or the future of any body's hands in a car because of all the risks and what has happened in the past.       ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"In "" The Challenges of Exsploring Venus"" how the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is by comparing venus to earth by saying "" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.

What i think the author is trying to say is that Venus is very much like earth."" even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's athmosphere."" Why i think this is a detail that supports the claim is becouse in paragraph 3 the author list all of the negitives about Venus of how the temeture is exstreamly hot and how thick the atmosphere is and how the the clouds are filled with highly corrosive acid. despite all of these things about Venus it is still interesting exslpore and to learn about.

"In American society today- and other countries also- it's safe to say that only a little bit more than half of teengers are wanting to get their driver's liscense. It is the same way with adults too. More people are choosing to move to smaller communities where shopping centers and restaraunts are a walking distance away. At first, it was all about just following the trend or a new law. Now people are realizing that not driving everywhere is benificial in more than one way.

In Europe, this trend is growing rapidly and has been for a few years now. Countries like Germany, Frace and Switzerland are examples of where a large percentage of their population don't drive cars. In Vauban, Germany it is against the law to park anywhere except for parking garages and if the car-owner purchases their own parking space, with a home also, for $40,000. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" P3). Greenhouse gas emissions are produced from 12% of car-owners in Europe. With less cars, it is said there the city has a less tense and/or stressful vibe to it, and the pollution level has decreased dramatically.

In America, the love for cars is not as strong anymore either. In April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995, and 23% of people weren't driving between the years of 2001-2009. ""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting 'car reduced' communites, and legislators are are starting to act, if cautiously."" (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" P9). Though reducing the amount of cars being driven has a positive impact on the environment, it will have a negative impact on car indistries across the U.S.

Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia have prooved that having less car-owners has decreased pollution levels. In Bogota, there is a Day Without Cars where only public transportation is allowed. Citizens will suffer a $25 fine if they are driving their own car. Paris, France temporarilly banned driving, and if they were found driving a 22-euro fine was charged. Both countries saw immediate results in the ammount of smog in theit cities.

It is obvious that not owning a car or choosing to walk more than driving has effected places like Europe, America and South America in a positive way. As more people realize that limiting car usage is good for the environment and benificial to their everyday lives, less people will be driving and the world will slowly see start to see a change.

"Dear Principal,

I believe that your Policy 1 is better than your Policy 2. I think this because cell phones can be very helpful in unexpected times of emergency and/or other situations. For example, if something were to happen to a student, whether personal or bad, and the office was not available than the student could use their cell phone. Another reason is that this gives students an opportunity to communicate with other siblings or friends that do not go to the same school. Also, if there was an emergency involving another family member or close family friend, it would be easier to contact the student with the cell phone especially if it was a very personal family matter. If the students were not allowed to have cell phones in school at all and let's say, for a student, plans had changed for who was picking he/she up and it was decided by the parents after school was out. How would they contact him/her to let them know? Also, how would that student know how to deal with the situation? Cell phones help kids stay aware and figure out how to handle certain things that come their way during their days at school. So, from all this I think that kids should be allowed to bring cell phones to school. But, only as long as they keep them off and in their lockers or book bags during all class hours.

"The Electoral colleg is a process in which the electors from the state pick the cannidate they want according to who has the popular vote. Which can also be a very biased process. The Electoral College is not registered or monitered enough because if an elector from the state wanted to pick who they want to win they could and there isn't really anything to stop them from doing so.

We the people should do away with the Electoral College and instead switch to a more regulated system like majority voting. whichever cannidate that gets the most votes from the U.S. takes the win. that way we wouldnt have to worry about our electors for the states being sneaky because there wont be any electors. State legislature is responsible for picking the electors and the electors sometimes defy the will of the people and cast the vote for who they want to win just like when Richard Nixon only validated his opponets electors in 1960. The Electoral College would be a more just way of voting if the electors were well monitored and if every state shared the same weight in the vote but unfortunatley, it's not like that so it needs to be done away with.

The Electoral College is a unrestricted and very poorly regulated process, and it is a very unfair process. Because of the winner-take-all system. In 1968, if 41,971 voters voted a diffrent way the election would have been deadlocked. In 1976, if roughkly 5,500 voters in Ohio and about 3,600 voters in Hawaii had voted for a diffrent person the election would have been a tie. And usually the bigger states are the only ones to actually see their cannidates because the cannidates dont neccesarily visit states with very few electoral votes because they wont help them as much instead, they visit the ""swing states"", the states that have a bigger weight in the presidential election.

However, on the other side the people that want to keep it are the ones that look at the few good things not the bad things. Of those helpful things that comes with the electoral college is it majorly decreases the chance of a run-off election in which no cannidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral college also puts out a certainty of outcome because there is less likely to be a dispute over the outcome in a popular vote then a dispute over an Electoral College vote.

Of course, in life there is always at least some good in things like the Electoral College but in this situation is does more harm then good. It is an overall unfair process because some states are less noticed because of how few electoral votes they hold and also because of the electors not being monitered on the vote they cast for their state. The Electoral College should be doen away with and as a united country we shall adopt a more fair, equal , and all together well monitered system of voting.    ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Students would not benefit from attending classes at home. Students would have more ways to get distracted. The students would have less experience in a workplace environment. Technical problems would be much more harder to deal with. Many students would not benefit from being taught online.

Attending classes from home has a negative impact on their focus as they are easily distracted. Students may not be able to focus as they have family or friends over. Students may also have phones and television to distract them while working online. School computers block sites that might take the students off task, but at home they can reach those sites easily. Teachers are not going to be able to really help the students through a moniter. There is little distraction in the classroom. Teachers help minimize the distractions in the classroom by always keeping the students on task.

The students that attend classes from home tend to have less workplace experience. Students may get so used to learning at home that it hurts them from practicing in a workplace environment. Students may not know how to interact with other classmates or co-workers. Learning at school allows the students to interact with eachother. By learning at school whenever the students are faced with a group assignment they are able to work together and complete the assignment. While not having classmates takes away some distractions, it will not help them in the long term. Allowing students to wake up late will hurt as they may need to get up for work or other important matters.

Having technical problems at home is much worse than when they happen at school.

When a student that takes classes from home has technical problems, they could have zero to little work done on their computer. The students computer may down for a long period of time and the teacher can not wait for everyone to finish their assignments. It may also cost money to get the students computer repaired and working again. At school, administrators limit the amount of technical problems that happens to the internet. The school always has someone working on the computers, while at home it's only the students who have to get the internet or computers back and working. At home teachers can not help the student fix their internet, while their internet is down wasting time the student may have to finish their assignment.

Allowing students to attend class at home hurts them in the long term. The students would be more distracted at home then they would be at school. With less workplace experience at home, the students would have a hard time working in groups later in life. Having technical problems limits the students choices on how to finish the assignment on time. Students will not benefit from attending classes online at home.        ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The potential addition of an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day for students could have a significant impact on their lives. For example, it is possible that student performance could improve if they are given extra time to focus on studies or better understand the material. Additionally, this increase in time may limit the amount of time available for family and peer relationships due to the addition of more school hours. Furthermore, local school districts could be faced with strain due to the heightened burden of providing teachers, resources, and updating curriculum to accommodate the addition.

"Imagining a day without a car seems impossible if you are one of those people who depend on a car seven days a week. If you, my fellow citizens, take the chance to live at least a day without a car you would experience all the advantages of not having a vehicle. These advantages include, saving money, time and the enviroment. Not only will you be saving things we all wish to save on, we will also gain the oppurtunity to have more one on one time with friends or even family.

Experiencing a day without something you always depend on may seem foolish, considering, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (paragraph 5, Source 1:

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

) Living a day without your vehicle you can find yourself saving time,according to paragraph 43, (Source 4:

The End of Car Culture

) ""Transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources,lower emissions and improve safety."" If more and more people decide to live a motor-vehicle free life, then this could result in less traffic which can result in having enough time for that cup of coffee before work.

Although, if you dont have a car to get to further places that means you would have to take public transportation, such as a bus. When riding a bus, it is obvious that you are not the only passenger which means that you are not the only stop, this could result in a longer ride. When heading some where, its common that the person needs or wants to get there at a specific time, this could be a reason why not having a car could not apply to you.

Apparently, using public transportation or car pooling can give you the opportunity to bond with your friends, who would want that before arriving at your eight hour shift? As mentioned in paragraph 35, ""The rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexiable commuting arrangements.""(Source 4:

The End of Car Culture

) This could be difficult for you to imagine but it is known that us, humans, are creatures of habit, ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit..."" (paragraph 36,Source 4:

The End of Car Culture

) This means that once we start this amazing and life changing habit, we won't be able to stop.

Clearly, not having a vehicle could give you many advantages in your every day life. No more time being wasted or losing touch with close friends. Instead of viewing this as something negative, take it as something positive so that you could adapt and let riding a bike to work, a life changing habit.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"As an 8th grade student, I believe that people should make their own decisions. Making decisions is an important part of life, and it is essential to be able to make decisions about important aspects of life, such as marriage, relocation, and recognizing good and bad things in life. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of making your own decisions and provide examples that highlight the importance of making your own decisions.

One of the main benefits of making your own decisions is that it allows you to take responsibility for your life. When you make your own decisions, you are in control of your life, and you are responsible for the outcomes of those decisions. This is important because it helps you to develop a sense of self-awareness and self-reliance. By making your own decisions, you are able to learn from your mistakes and grow as a person.

Another benefit of making your own decisions is that it allows you to make decisions that are tailored to your own needs and preferences. When you make your own decisions, you are able to choose things that you truly want and need, rather than being forced to make decisions based on the opinions of others. This is important because it helps you to live a life that is authentic and fulfilling.

One example of the importance of making your own decisions is the decision to get married. When you make the decision to get married, you are committing to a long-term relationship with someone else. This is a major decision that should not be taken lightly. If you do not make your own decision about whether or not to get married, you may end up in a relationship that is not right for you. On the other hand, if you make your own decision about whether or not to get married, you are able to choose a partner who is right for you and who will support you in your life.

Another example of the importance of making your own decisions is the decision to relocate. When you make the decision to relocate, you are leaving behind your current home and community. This is a major decision that should not be taken lightly. If you do not make your own decision about whether or not to relocate, you may end up in a place that is not right for you. On the other hand, if you make your own decision about whether or not to relocate, you are able to choose a place that is right for you and where you",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Ralph Waldo Emerson's words, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail,"" have inspired generations of thinkers to push beyond their comfort zones in search of personal and professional growth. This idea can be applied across a variety of professions, such as entrepreneurs who must have the courage to move into uncharted waters in order to create something new, academics who must stretch the boundaries of existing knowledge, and artists who take risks in their work in order to break new ground. While professional sports players may also strive to expand their skills and knowledge for the sake of progress, they are somewhat of an exception to the rule. This is because a successful sports career is often based upon rigorous practice and training within a pre-established environment. However, even athletes must periodically challenge themselves to innovate in order to stay competitive. Looking beyond the realms of athletics, examples of individuals being pushed out of their comfort zones for growth can be seen in numerous scenarios. From corporate CEOs looking for novel solutions to global problems, to everyday people looking to break free from limiting circumstances, the necessity of venturing outside of one's safely constructed realm of knowledge is a recurring theme.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3

Because if somebody was to get in a reck and they wasnt driving but the car was driving its self they gone come to the people who made the car because they feel like it was thier fault. Even tho you told them that they still had to pay attention to the rode they not cuz they feel like the car can watch its self. so if you dont put the car on the market you can save your company alont of money and alot of stress.

Third, you wouldnt wanna be the reason for any deaths, because if you start getting so many deaths on your car nobody is going to want your car so now you then wasted money on all these cars and parts for these cars that nobody is buying so you just lost alot of money and nobobody just has money to waste. If your company starts to lose money they gone have to start cutting people because they can no longer pay you, and the first person they are going to fire are the people who came up with the idea that caused them to lose so much money in conslusion i think t would be your best bet to just not make the cars because your saving money, your saving lives so now your heros, and you dont have to worry about anybody tryong to sue you for most of everything yall got because if the person win boy yall feelings gone be hurt ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"People all over the world like to try new things. Everyday we are all faced with new and different challenges. Being in a car that drives itself would be trying something new and extraordinary. Why not drive in a car that drives itself?

Why not? This question is one of the greatest questions you can ask. A car that drives itself what more could you ask for. This would open new doors and ideas. On long car rides you would not have to drive. You could look at the scenery or enjoy your time with your family. A car that drives itself would be the next step into something amazing. Over time the cars will become safer and more reliable. This would mean you could go faster in the car. Your running late for work and it takes fifteen minutes to get there, well not anymore. The car would be like a car in Nascar you could get to your destination in an instant. A car that could drive itself would benefit a lot of people in this world.

In the reading it said that the driveless car would use half the fuel of a taxi car. You would not have to waste your money on gas every week. That would help most people out, even for new drivers that have to pay for gas. This also means that there will be less pollution and it will help people breathe easier. When the automatic cars become more reliable and faster and you are late to pick up your kids the car would get you there fast with no problem. Automatic taxi services will be in great need across the country because now people do not have to buy a car. People will have their own taxi car that will pick them up at their house and take them to work. These taxi cars would never be late since they are smart, so you would never again have to worry about being late. you also would not have to take your own car or wait for someone to come pick you up. People would love the experience of just having their own taxi service that would come to pick them up. They would feel more important and become happier.

How many wrecks happen each year? I was in a wreck this year. Another car hitting you, I thought, would never happen to me. I started driving a couple weeks later. That experience made me a safer driver. Still, there are people that get injured and killed every week because of careless drivers. This automatic car would reduce the amount of fatal accidents. Just thinking that you would be one-hundred percent safe in a car would be a great feeling. If you are an adult you could let your kids go into these car by themselves if you wanted to and you would know that they will be safe and will never be in a wreck.

Cars that drive themselves. This would be a great new experience. In 60 years I could tell my grandchildren that I was in the generation that could finally drive in self-driving cars. These cars would benefit the whole world in a positive way. Together we can make the world better and safer by having smarter cars. It is a new a way of living, a better way of living. Humans, Since ancient times, have always wanted to advance in technology. This new car will take us to places we have never gone before. Let us move on and go into a world of self-driving cars and see where it will take us.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Imagination is an invaluable tool that ought to be used in tandem with knowledge to uncover creativity and greater understanding of the world. Rather than being limited to a mere collection of facts, imagination helps to create new pathways for exploration that reflect our individual perspectives. For example, think of the many inventions and advances in science or art that have been made not out of methodical analysis or study – but instead out of imagination and creativity. A good example of this is Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone – something he thought of while contemplating ways to send multiple telegraph messages at the same time. Our ability to “daydream” unlocks potential for new and exciting ideas, theories, and inventions.

"""Students , i would like for you to tell our principal why its is important for us to perform community service , do next class"" . Hmm community service ? well i think that it is important because if people litter eventually out earth is going to be a total mess and the WILL be garbage everywhere , it would be a great task to do after school or on free time and importantly if you would be helping a student our education progress will most likely go up like fire works at the park on fourth of July . I f your still not convinced let me explain my self better .

To begin with , i think i strongly agree for us students to be required to do community service because we are the kids from the future and our earth will become a total dump . I mean kids do have the strength to go around when the have free time and pick up trash for a local park or maybe as a class field trip go to the beach and pick up all the nasty litter people leave their it would be a win , win situation because in out win we will have a progress to a better earth and better place to live and the other win would have to do with the animals out in the ocean , the would also have ea better home and a cleaner place to live . The already going threw an oil spill i honestly don't think the need any more thing in their water . For an example think to yours self would you like to live in water and other people come and just throw things in your 'home' ? didn't think so , neither do i and neither do they .

Secondly , It would be an awesome activity to do after school or maybe even on free time . In stead of sitting around on the computer or on the phone or even sitting their watching t. v

Students can do something productive with their time and make our earth a better place and even maybe have fun with community service it only for our goods . Its not like your doing it for a bad cause . I also think it will educate us not to litter and treat our world better then we do now .

On the other hand i think making us students do community service because if the high school students or maybe middle school student decide to tutor elementary , the education will MOST LIKELY make progress . This is also a win , win situation because the high school/ middle school student would be able to get their minds refreshed with what the learned a couple years back and the other win would be the student from elementary would be getting help and will make progress with their academics . I know that parents will be coming to you saying ""wow , SCHOOL_NAME has an amazing principal and teachers cause they know how to really help my son/daughter "" and wouldn't that be nice ? thought so .

All in all i think the our principal should really think about our school doing community service because our word WILL become a total dump if kids of the futures don't put their foot down and start to cleaning our earth with community service and it is a good activity to do after school or in free time and not become couch potatoes and if students decide to tutor the education progress and the grade of our younger student will increase . Now i would like to know , don't you think it would be an awesome idea to have us do community service ?",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Adding two more hours to a school's schedule every day would have both positive and negative effects on students. On the positive side, it would allow for more time for students to learn and improve in various subjects. It would also give students more time to participate in extracurricular activities and engage in social and emotional learning. However, on the negative side, it would require students to spend more time in school, potentially leading to burnout and decreased motivation.

One of the main benefits of adding two more hours to a school's schedule would be the increased time for learning and improvement. Students would have more time to focus on their studies and work on assignments, allowing them to better understand and retain information. This would ultimately lead to better academic performance and a stronger foundation for future learning. Additionally, the extra time would allow for more in-depth and engaging lessons, which could help students become more interested and motivated to learn.

Another positive aspect of adding more hours to a school's schedule would be the increased time for extracurricular activities. Many students participate in sports, clubs, and other activities outside of the classroom, and the extra time would allow them to continue to participate and develop these interests. This would not only benefit the students, but also the school and community as a whole, as it would foster a sense of community and promote healthy and active lifestyles.

However, there are also potential negative consequences to adding two more hours to a school's schedule. One of the main concerns is the potential for burnout and decreased motivation. Students already have a lot on their plates, with school, homework, and extracurricular activities, and adding more time to the school day could lead to feelings of overwhelm and exhaustion. This could ultimately lead to decreased engagement and participation in school, as well as decreased academic performance.

Another potential negative consequence of adding more hours to a school's schedule would be the potential for decreased family time. Many students have families with busy schedules, and the extra time in school could lead to conflicts and decreased time for family activities. This could have a negative impact on the student's mental and emotional well-being, as well as their relationships with their family members.

In conclusion, adding two more hours to a school's schedule every day would have both positive and negative effects on students. While it would",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"In my opinion the Facial Action Coding System technology is a great valuable and reliable application for students to get into, I say this because not only does it sound smart, but Dr. Huang gives much details about the invention and explains how the model works when recognizing emotions. Dr. Huang sticks to his topic of the Facial Action Coding System, he has predictions about it as well by saying that ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor, also gets into human and emotional communication. The 6 types of basic emotions are also discussed in this article and they're happiness, suprise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness. Although many are associated with facial movements which are the types of feelings and the type of reaction someone gives when feeling these types of ways.

Dr. Huang gives more brief discriptions of this technology by explaining how humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" every day then after supporting his claim he gives examples to inform humans about the technology. Dr. Huang wants to make sure he is doing his best on explaining the theory of emotions and the information explained is a perfect example to set to intrest and to make sure these are valuable. These are the many reasons why I am for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional claims.

These theory of emotions could work for some students and not work for others, I say this beacuse there are different types of people in the world with different types of situations in life. Although Dr. Huang technology sounds great it might not be the best option for every student, but he still makes a great administrator and a great leader to me in my opinion. This technoology sounds like an amazing experiment to have and try, so this is why I am all for the value of using technology to read students' emotional expressions.      ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Principal,

I think students should be allowed to have their cell phones at school.

it would be okay if students used them during their free time at school.

If there is only a school phone it could lead to problems with only one phone available.

Students should have their phones so that if there's an emergency they will be able to call their parents or the police.

It would be okay for students to have cell phones at school but as long as its not during class time , only during free time.

It could be good idea for students to have a cell phone at school.

If a student would get caught using a cell phone in class it should be confiscated.

So cell phones could be a good and bad idea but, students should be allowed to have their cell phones at school.

Our generation relies on technology to get news and to stay in touch with others.

So, i hope you decide and pick policy 1 so the students can bring their cell phones to school.            ",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Technology that reads students' emotional expressions should absolutely be used. This technology would make it possible for a computer to know how a student is feeling during an assignment, which could help with advances in later work.

Confusion, boredom, anger, whatever a student is feeling during an assignment a computer can pick that up. In paragragh six,Dr. Haug states,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This could change lots of things. If a computer notices a student getting bored from an assignment, perhaps they can make the next assignment more interesting. When a student is bored during an assignment, they tend to not be completely focus or to not do the work. With this technology computers could prevent students from getting bored during assignments, which could result in more students doing their work. This technology could also help students when they are confused or don't understand something in the lesson, by modifying the lesson, which could be needed for many students.

In the article aslo states, ""If you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown,the next ad will be different."" This could change alot for students that have any type of social media. Social media could become much more popular using this type of technology. Students will see things they like, thus pleasing them. Then, they will begin to like social media even more and maybe even encourage others to join.

This new technology could change alot for students and even students with life on social media. Students would do much better in school if this technology were to be used in schools. Assignments turned in on time would become more effecient, students would pay attention to their work instead of dozing off, and students would not be as confused and have more help with their assignments. While students will also grow to love social media much more, resulting in more money for the distributers of social media.

"Phones & Driving

One of the most controversial arguments is that of texting or talking on the phone while driving. This controversial argument is debated all of the world and why or why not it's wrong. Regardless of opinions, there are statistics and facts on using your phone and driving. The facts say that it's not the right thing to do for a number of reasons such as accidents. The fact is that using your phone and driving is wrong for a lot and here's the reason why.

Approximately 660,000 drivers attempt to use their phones behind the wheel of a car every day. Smartphones have made it easy for us to stay connected at all times. But that can create serious risks if someone decides to check their phone when they're behind the wheel. Risks such as car crashes. The National Safety Council reports that people who use their cell phone while driving causes 1.6 million crashes each year. One out of every four accidents that take place in the US are due to cell phone usage and almost 390,000 injuries happen each year caused by texting and driving.

Texting and driving being dangerous enough, people also tend to talk on the cell phone while driving, which some people think is less dangerous than texting and driving but, there is still a number of safety hazards to worry about when talking on the phone and driving. One of the obvious rules to follow when driving is to keep both hands on the steering wheel while driving. Specifically ten and two, which they tell you when you go to get your driver's license. This action can't be achieved if one hand is holding the phone to your ear. There are some exceptions to talking on the phone and driving such as having speaking on the phone and connecting it to the car via, bluetooth. This is hand free and therefor not dangerous.

Due to the number of crashes and accident that are related to making calls on the phone and texting while driving, some states have made it illegal to use the phone completely while driving. Cell phone use has also become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. While talking on the phone or texting, drivers are distracted decreasing the driver's awareness while they are on the road, which lead to a number of crashes. Drivers who text that are behind the wheel are twenty-three times more likely to have a crash.

In conclusion, texting or talking on the phone while driving is not safe for anyone. It will more than likely cause an accident and people can wait to make that one phone call or that last text. Risking your life is not worth it. Driving while using cell phones should be a thing of the past. Texting and driving should not be done anymore and nobody should suffer from crashes or accidents due to a driver using their phone while behind the wheel.   ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"I strongly believe in students having to obtain a B average.

Students need to realize that school comes before sports because if you do good in school you will go farther in life.

Sports should be a reward not just something you get any ways. Those on the opposing side think that a C average is passing but soon it will be a D average and then some kids will start failing their classes.

Students need to learn how to be responsible.

It is a privilege to be able to play sports and if someone took sports away from me it would push me to do better in school so i could play sports.

A lot of students who are good enough to play college sports won't be able to because of their grades.

Keeping your grades up to a B average could help you in the future when you are old enough to get a job.

A company might be comparing you to someone who has a B average and you have a C average they will most likely pick the B average.

If you keep your grades up to a B average you would have a better chance of getting into college than if you had a C average.

College could help you get a good job in your future and it would give you a good life.

In conclusion having to obtain a B average would push people who want to play sports to get good grades.

Which would lead you to a better life than obtaining a C average.

But, I doubt that there are very many more students that also agree with you're possible policy that ""The Only Way a Student May Participate in Sports or Other Activities Unless They Maintain a B Average"". I agree that that policy should be enforced upon us, because having to maintain a B average might push students harder in doing better in school; like studying more and being more focused, now that their sports are at risk.

"Talking to three people will help anybody with something they cant decide on. If somebody says one thing and then you say another. The only solution is to only get help from one other person. So that you could have three including yourself. Their is no reason to have only ask one person something because when anyone ask three people something, its bound to have a answer because its three people and there is an odd number of people.

Studies have shown, when anybody ask more than one person a for advice then it gets solved quickly. Whenever there is two people and they gives you advice that you disagree with. All everyone should do is just ask one more person for advice. After that then you will finally know just side with the person that likes your idea. The next time you you want advice from one person remember this.

One person is greater than two. If anyone were to ask a group of three. With you making four, there will most likely be a tie. Lets say you pick blue and one other person goes with you, that remains two more and they like orange. that means there is a tie.

So basically what i'm am saying is that. When a group of people have a even number there is a impossible chance of solving witch person to go with for advice. Okay when you talk to one person then it could be helpful to take advice from them. But its a better idea to ask two because now there is another side to just that one earlier.

If your friend were to get in a fight. And you were right there. The principle isn't just going to take you side. They will see if the other kid could tell there side, so that they will have more than one side of the story.

"We should go with changing to election by popular vote for president because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president.

"Schools that are required to give out summer project should be student-designed. Students should have a oppertunity to pick their own summer projects because it allows them to be more creative. It will give students less of a chance to cheat off each other. It will also help the teachers know more about their students, what they struggle with and what they understand.

Students can be more creative and willing to do the project if they get to design it themselves. If its about something that is special to them they will put more effort into doing it. Most of the summer projects I got I didnt do because it didn't interest me at all. In English, they usually give out a summer reading list of books they want you to read. I would try to read the books that were on the list but they never made me want to finish it. If I had the oppertunity to pick my own books then I would read all summer.

Letting students pick there own project would keep kids from cheating because if they have to pick their own topic then two kids can't write about the same thing the exact same way. Most students do their project at the last minute and schedules come out toward the end of summer. Therefore, they match their classes together or see if they have the same teacher and then they share answers before school even starts. Students shouldn't be given out packets with all the exact same questions because they will just cheat and learn nothing. Instead, we should be given projects that we get to pick.

If we get to pick projects that mean somethng to us then the teachers can know more about who we are and not just by some packet with questions. Students could make projects about something that happened in their life or something that means a lot to them. Most teachers don't even care to know your name not to mentin who you even are. I still have teachers that ask me what my name is when they write a pass for me and i have been in school for almost 6 months. If students could do projects that mean something to them then maybe teachers would know who they are and not just some paper they are grading.

In conclsion, Students should pick their projects and desgin the projects themselves. By letting students have a choice, It helps them and teachers too. The more creative students can be the more participation there will be. Cheating isn't accepted in school so why would you even give the chance for them to cheat? ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The amount pressure that is put on students has dramatically increased recently. Some students have jobs or play sports, and some even do both. Trying to make time for their extra curricular activities, family, friends and school has become a difficult task. Online classes are now offered, and are more ideal for some students considering their daily life. Students should be able to attend class from home because it can reduce stress from social anxiety, allow them to work at their own pace, and can limit certain distractions.

Mental health is a major focus in today's society, and anxiety is a very common disorder. My sister has very bad social anxiety and often has panic attacks about going to school. These episodes can cause her brain to only focus on her anxiety and cause her to not be aware of what is going on around her, thus distracting her form actually learning and focusing on school. By attending school online, from the comfort of our home, my sister is able to focus on her school work and not worry about the social aspect of school.

Another reason why attending school from home can be beneficial is because students can work at their own pace. Sometimes a ninety minute block is not enough time for someone to understand a concept. If they are doing class online, they can spend some extra time in that area and better understand what is being taught. This would be especially useful for students with activities other than school. If they understand a concept really well, they should not have to sit in school and relearn it when other students do not understand, while they could be doing something more productive. The extra time could be spent working or doing a little extra training for a sport they love.

Lastly, online school could be beneficial because it can limit distractions. While in school, kids may start talking to their peers instead of doing the work or paying attention, and this can lead to a decrease in their test scores. If a student was at home, they could sit in a quiet room and put all of their attention towards their school work. Other distractions may also be limited, such as drama going on at school, which can cause kids to get into fights or only think about the incident that just occurred. Again, if the student was in a quiet room working on school, these unnecessary distractions could be avoided.

Although many people believe school is a place for a child to grow and learn about the real world, the point that the school system pushes is for the child to pass the class and excel just with the curriculum given to them. There are other events that can teach a child about the real world, such as getting a job or doing an activity they are passionate about. With extra time from limiting distractions that would happen at school, a child would have more time to do those things. In the end, online school would be beneficial for students in many ways such as improving their mental health and creating an environment where a student can be more productive rather than if they were at school. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Should summer projects be student-designed? In my opinion, yes; I feel as though summer projects should be student-designed. Students should be able to express their creativity and have the freedom to think outside the box, rather than be held back of their ideas and inner thoughts. On the other hand, teachers also feel as though that they should be allowed to give specific project topics or ideas to their students, instead of students creatively thinking for themselves due to a lack of performance in the classroom. Though, teachers believe summer projects should be designed through their ideas due to poor performance in the classroom, students should be given a chance to express themselves and the freedom to create their own projects.

As a student, summer break is supposed to be a time to get away from school, classwork, homework, and a time to relax. However, in other schools; learning never stops. Due to schools wanting kids to learn during summer vacation, students are given summer projects to keep them focused. All students around different schools believe that having the chance to create things using their ideas will enhance their learning experience. Also, students feel as though that teachers are more in tune of what the students feel or want, rather than give them an assignment that doesn't appeal to them as much. Furthermore, I; myself as a student has had the chance to receive student-designed projects and to me, it's one of the greatest things not only for me, but for my classmates as well; it allows us to show our ability in what we know how to do and how well do we understand the topic we choose in exchange for a good grade.

In other cases, there are teachers who believe that classroom performance can play a roll in students receiving teacher-designed projects during the summer. Some teachers disagree in allowing a class to behave poorly or set low expectations for each other and give them an assignment that will be ""fun"" or ""enjoyable"" to please students. Other teachers for instance, think that students need to challenge themselves more in class and not settle for a decent grade, instead; elevate their work ethic to a greater amount for the grade they worked for. However, teachers will also give assignments just based on lesson plans or things they truly believe is what needs to be focused on and assigned to the students.

In conclusion, students should be given the opportunity to have projects designed by them to see what they know, showcase their ability of creating a unique topic that's original, and allow teachers to see what students can do on their own, than seek guidance to have a planned project assigned to them.",0,persuade_corpus,1

I think the you should follow the second phones at school because they can lose their phone.

some reasons are they can lose their phone at school. its a rule at any school and any thing can happen.

you should also follow the first policy because students may need to contact their parents or if they are in any after school programs like cheerleading, basketball etc.

There are many reasons why students should and should not have their phones in school, I think they should be able to bring their phones just turn them off because there so many reason why they need their phone.

Then again they shouldn't bring their phone because they might text during class taking up the time they need so they can learn. Many principal many get many complaints about their students having their phones in school I believe they cant do any thing about it, if one of their students phone goes off they shouldn't be able to take it but if it was out in plain view then they can take it but i think at the end of that class period they should be able to get it back but the teacher have to turn it off and let them know they cant turn it back on till the end of the day when they go home.

From point of view i believe that we should be able to have are phones in case of in emergency because we never know when somebody at school gets hurt o injured if they don't have any contacts on that student because they weren't allowed to bring phones to school its really falls down on that school.

"Self-esteem can be achieved through a variety of activities that focus on different aspects of one's life. Respect, effort, and behavior all have an impact on self-esteem. By building strong relationships with friends and family, forming healthy habits, and taking pride in the work that one is capable of, it is possible to feel better about oneself. 

Respect for oneself is an important factor in maintaining self-esteem. Considering one's actions and what kind of impact they have on others will help form a sense of self-worth. Being mindful of how one is treated and how one treats others helps create a sense of security.

Making a conscious effort to build better habits and take ownership of one's behavior is also necessary for self-esteem. Instead of taking the easy way out, putting in the time and energy to get the job done is an effective way to build self-confidence. Along with this comes the idea that even if mistakes are made, a person can learn from them and be open to the idea of growth and improvement.

Education can help build self-esteem, too. Learning new skills, tactics, and knowledge can lead to new opportunities and experiences. Learning how to prioritize tasks and develop organizational skills will lead to better functioning in everyday life.

Ultimately, having a sense of self-esteem comes from within, and the only person who can make it happen is the one taking the steps necessary to make it happen. When respect for oneself and others, effort, and behavior are all considered, it is possible to attain a healthy sense of self-esteem.",1,chat_gpt_moth,4
"The topic of the story is about venus and about exploring venus because, in the reading it is giving information on the distance frome the earth and how chalenging and interesting it is for venus to be examined. I got this frome the info frome the first paragraph sentence 3. Venus is also is the second planet frome the sun which is in paragraph 1 sentence 2. I can aonclude that venus is a pretty enteressting planet to try to explore.

I think that the author think's that venus is also an interesting planet to study because of the chalenging planet's flaw's I can conclude this because in paragraph 2 sentence 4 the reading states that since no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours and that it also states that in the 2nd paragraph it states that the reputation of the planet is chalenging do to the proximity.

I believe that most of the reason that venus is to be considered chalenging. Is because of the thick atmosphere and the temprature on the planet I found this information frome p3 sentence 1 throgh 3 and it states that almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blanket's and that the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid's in the planet's atmosphere on venuse's atmosphere and that the temprature average over 800 degrees fahrenhight and that the pressure being over 90 time's greater they experienced.

The planet venus have some comeparenson's to the planet earth that what make planet venus worthy to explore like having feature's like valley's,mountain'sand crater's just like earth. I got this information frome p4 sentence 3-4 which I think why the author also think that venus would be worth studying and how interesting it would be if they could try to actualy atemtp land on venus.

I think that venus would be a cool place to study because having access to better material that it can make NASA landing on venus easier and make the landing safer than before with also knew technology. I would also think that the author would be able to expireince wha venus is like and that it would be an adventure to explore venus and to discover knew thing's on the planet.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"As an 8th grader, I have to say that the idea of allowing students to use cell phones in the classroom is a pretty controversial topic. On one hand, it could be really helpful to have access to educational resources or to be able to contact our parents or guardians in case of an emergency. But on the other hand, I can see how it could be really distracting for other students and could totally waste class time.

One of the main pros of allowing cell phones in the classroom is that it could make it easier for students to access educational resources. For example, if we're learning about a new topic in science class, we could look up videos or articles on our phones to get a better understanding of the concept. Or if we're doing a project in math class, we could use our phones to look up calculator apps to help us with our calculations. That could be really helpful and make it easier for us to learn.

But there are also some pretty big cons to consider. For one thing, it could be really distracting for other students if everyone in the class is on their phones all the time. We could be texting our friends or scrolling through social media instead of paying attention to the lesson, and that could really affect our learning. And if we're not paying attention, we might not retain as much information as we would if we were paying attention to the teacher.

Another con is that it could waste a lot of class time. If we're constantly on our phones during class, we might not be able to get through all of the material that we need to. And if we fall behind, it could be really hard to catch up, especially if we're not able to use our phones in class. That could be really frustrating and could affect our grades.

Overall, I think that allowing students to use cell phones in the classroom is a pretty complicated issue. While it could be helpful in some ways, it could also be really distracting and waste a lot of time. I think that the teachers should make some rules about when and how we can use our phones in class, so that we can get the most out of our learning experience. Maybe we could only be able to use our phones during breaks or for specific tasks, like looking",1,llama2_chat,4
"As an 8th grader, I'm excited to research and write about engineering jobs, their requirements, and the skills needed. Engineering is a fascinating field that involves creating innovative solutions to real-world problems. I've always been interested in science and math, and I think engineering could be a great career path for me.

To start, I learned that engineers are problem solvers. They use their knowledge of math, science, and technology to design and develop new products, systems, and infrastructure. Engineers work in various fields, including mechanical, electrical, civil, and computer engineering. Each field has its unique set of challenges and opportunities. For example, mechanical engineers design and develop machines, while electrical engineers work on electrical systems and electronics.

One of the most important requirements for engineers is a strong foundation in math and science. They need to understand the principles of physics, calculus, and other mathematical concepts to solve complex problems. Engineers also need to be creative and have good problem-solving skills. They must be able to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to challenging problems.

The day-to-day tasks of an engineer can vary depending on their field and specialty. Mechanical engineers might work on designing and testing prototypes, while electrical engineers might work on developing new electronic devices. Engineers also collaborate with other professionals, such as architects and technicians, to ensure that their designs are safe, efficient, and meet the needs of clients.

One of the biggest benefits of being an engineer is the potential for job stability and financial rewards. Engineers are in high demand, and they can earn good salaries and benefits. They also have the opportunity to work on exciting and challenging projects that make a real difference in the world. For example, environmental engineers work on developing sustainable energy systems and reducing pollution, while aerospace engineers design and develop new aircraft and spacecraft.

However, obtaining and maintaining an engineering job can be challenging. Engineers need to have strong technical skills, but they also need to be able to communicate effectively and work well with others. They must be able to manage complex projects and meet tight deadlines. Engineers also need to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies",1,llama2_chat,1
"Do you think we should put facial action coding system in our classroo? I think using technology to read the emotions expressions in a classroom is a good thing because it tells you where your students are bord in class, see if they are mad in class, and tell someone is tired in the classromm.

See if the someone is bord in class is a good thing because you can make the subject or class more fun. That will make the student pay more attention in class because they won't be messing or not paying attention in class any more. In paragraph 6 it says ""A classrom computer could recoginze when a student is becoming confused or bored."" What they meant by that is the computer would put a different lesson than instead making the student do the lesson being bord or confussed. That will help a lot of students because they are gonna learn more and get good grades.

The facial action coding system could tell a person if they are tired because the computer can tell by their muscles. It will tell the teacher wich student is tired so they teacher can do something about it. It will help out a lot of the teachers from telling who's falling asleep.",0,persuade_corpus,0
I believe that a driverless car would be benificial in the sense that if you cannot afford to fly in an airplane for long distance travel then you could use the driverless car. The only way you would have to take over for the car is if the situation occurs like an accident or heavy road construction. If you are driving to California or Florida for example it would be alot more comfortable to do so then having to drive all those long hours. You might also have to stop for gas every once in a while but that is acceptable. The benifits of the driverless car are endless. If a certain car company puts in a television into the center dashboard then the driver could move his or her seat back and relax and watch tv. They could also just sit back and enjoy the ride. Much better then having to drive a long distence thus running the risk of falling asleep or getting dristracted by a phone or something like that. if need be the car shuts off the tv automaticlly and moves the seat back in the set position and the driver takes over. The sensors would be able to sense something far down the road to give the driver enough heads up to be able to take control of the car in time. A luxury car company like Cadillac or Audi could also make the interior of the car more comfortable and more enjoyable to make the long distence drive more worth while then flying and going through airport security and all those lines when you could hop in a driverless car and jump on the highway and let the car take over. The car company would also have to make the car more safe if an accident were to occur. I would much rather ride or drive a driverless car then having to risk falling asleep at the wheel. We all know how dangerous that is. Thats a big problem for the U.S and the soulution is the driverless car. This i think would be a great idea for car companys and would make them alot of money. If they could make these cars affordable. There are a few draw backs to this car but i think its a great idea.  ,0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear principal,

I believe all students must do tasks to assist the community. Students should participate in helping the community because it helps our community and city possibly even our state look good and it will make the children performing the tasks more responsible. Most kids helping with the community will feel good about themselves they will think to themselves wow i really did help make a difference in my community. They will often take pride in their work. We should help our communities.

Our community should have a right to look good. The children of OTHER_NAME should help clean our streets, help the needy, raise money for the city parks or even tutor the children in OTHER_NAME elementary schools. By doing this, the tourists will begin to say good things about the city of OTHER_NAME and the city of OTHER_NAME. We will receive more tourists and people interested in moving to OTHER_NAME or OTHER_NAME. We could even assist the needy, if we assist the needy we will look like a community that cares about our residents. When we help the younger we are helping our future lawyers and doctors even our future engineers with their education.

During our time in OTHER_NAME or OTHER_NAME helping the needy tutoring the children or participating in food drives we should stop to think to ourselves wow i really made a difference in not only their lives but my life also. we will feel depended on and we will most likely feel thankful. We will feel good about ourselves and we will want to participate in more activities to help our community.

Here in OTHER_NAME and OTHER_NAME our community is beautiful and clean. Whom do we have to thank for that you ask? The children of OTHER_NAME and the children of OTHER_NAME. Why of course all this work is due to the children of our community, we will see news headlines and it will be on kcal nine news and fox eleven and we children will be proud of ourselves and show pride in our community. So Mr. principal i hope you have come to an conclusion that you should encourage students to participate in community service, not only for the good of the people but for the good of the hearts of the children.

"Do you get sea sick and if not you can be a Seagoing Cowboy. It's nineteen forty-five, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries had left the ruins! Luke Bomberger would like you to help out too. If you would take a guess of what you would have to do? You would get to help out people that have lost their economy, food, and shelter.

The thing that this eighteen year-old boy enjoys coming back to get more supplies because the Cowboys play volleyball in the pens where the animals are located. They also play table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

When luke is helping people they also get to go to special places such as the Acropolis in Greece was special,""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city of streets of water."" He also toured and excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

What if I don't want to help said one of the people Luke had ask and what if I don't like taking care of people or animals. Luke had just said but it's a lifetime chance to go to all of those places and it would really make you happy but, if you don't want to go then just don't go. then that person named Joe said he wanted to go and that was Lukes best friend and Luke knew that they were going to have fun.

Do you think every body should do a extra curricular activity? Most people do activities but the school does not run them. A lot of schools dont even host good our a lot of programs. Most activities do not fit every body. After school things separate more time away from peoples family.

If someone makes the team for a sport over a kid who wants it more then that person. The student that made it gets forced to do something he docent want to do, and ruins opportunities for other kids. Students should not have to do a extra activity kid who want's it, freedom, and passionate.

Kids who really want's something might not be able to achieve there goal. They put in extra work and grinding for along time. Some kids might just be there to say they are on a team or program. If every one had to do one extra activity things would get packed. They have been trying there best for a lot of years and just join something for free.

People love to have freedom they like to go home play with there dog our younger siblings. next there some kids that like play video games and make money from that. Forcing kids do an activity might make sad if they get joked cause they do something wrong. Not every body parents or guardians can come pick the up after school. Theres a lot of kids out there like to do activities by them selves because it helps them focus.

Finally kids are passionate about there own activities. Having to do another activity can make some students irritated. Students are already at school for seven plus hours. Kids should follow there dreams stick to it and make new things happen.

Students would like to pro sue there own path.

At last this is why having extracurricular activities is not he brightest idea. Hope that this will put an idea principle thought. Having to do extra activity when just make the day if longer.

"Sure, here is an essay on the importance of believing in yourself and having hope in life, written as if it were a class assignment by an average 8th grade student:

Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about something super important: believing in yourself and having hope in life. Like, it's totally crucial to have hope, 'cause if you don't, stuff can get really dark and sad. I know, I've been there.

So, like, when you have hope, you're more likely to try new things and take risks. And that's how you learn stuff! Like, if you don't try new things, you'll never know if you could be good at 'em. And if you don't take risks, you'll never know if you could achieve something big. And that's where the magic happens, you know?

But, like, if you don't have hope, you might give up too easy. And that's when things get really bad. Like, if you don't believe in yourself, you might think you can't do something, and then you'll never even try. And that's when you start to feel like you're stuck, you know? Like, you're just gonna be stuck in the same old rut forever.

And it's not just about school stuff, either. It's about life stuff, too. Like, if you don't have hope, you might not be able to find a job you love, or make new friends, or even find happiness. And that's not something you wanna miss out on, right?

So, like, how can you make sure you have hope? Well, you can start by being positive and optimistic. Like, even when things are tough, you can try to find the good in it. And you can also try to set goals for yourself and work towards 'em. And don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it, either.

In conclusion, having hope and believing in yourself is super important. It can help you learn new things, take risks, and achieve your goals. And it can also help you find happiness and fulfillment in life. So, like, don't",1,llama2_chat,4
"Have you ever come home from a rough day at school and just wished you had something to do that would take your mind off of your stress? Many students deal with this problem on a daily basis, and there's a way to fix it. Extracurriculars for students should be required in schools because they help reduce stress, improve time management, and look really impressive when applying for schools.

Extracurriculars are an amazing way to help reduce stress for students by taking their mind away from their problems. Students often get overloaded with schoolwork and it can cause many problems emotionally and mentally. Recent studies have shown that kids who don't take sports or music outside of school are more likely to get depression or anxiety. If extracurriculars in schools were mandatory, less kids would get overwhelmed by stress.

Not only do extracurriculars help reduce stress in students, but they also help improve time management skills. Time management is a very important skill for kids not only in school but also for their lives in the future, and extracurriculars are a great way to teach them. When students have school on top of sports and other activities, they have less time to get everything done during the day. This causes students to learn ways to get their work done as soon as possible and fit everything into a small amount of time. Students with good time management skills tend to perform better in school because they never procrastinate on studying or homework. Many studies have been done on students who take extracurriculars compared to students who don't, and the results have shown that most students with extracurriculars have higher grades. If more kids took extracurriculars outside of school, they would improve their grades as a result of improving their time management skills.

When applying for colleges there's one thing that's really appealing about an applicant, and that's their extracurriculars. When a student takes multiple extracurriculars outside of school, it makes them look very skilled compared to other applicants. This can boost up a student's possibility of getting accepted into the school they apply for. Studies on colleges and their acceptance rates have proven that kids who were involved in more activities were accepted over students who weren't. The more skills you have, the better you look compared to someone who doesn't have as many. If schools required their kids to take extracurriculars, larger amounts of their students would get accepted into colleges.

Obviously, it would be very beneficial for schools to require their students to be involved in extracurriculars. Students would be less stressed, better at managing their time, and have a higher chance of getting into college. Extracurriculars are a great way to improve a student's life, and every student should want to make their life as amazing as possible.               ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Character is a fundamental aspect of who we are as individuals, and it is something that we have the power to shape and define for ourselves. In today's world, there is a growing emphasis on the importance of self-awareness and personal growth, and this includes the process of choosing our own character traits. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why it is important to choose our own character traits, examine how our behavior and appearance are related to our character, and give examples of how our character has been judged by our actions.

One of the main reasons why it is important to choose our own character traits is that it allows us to be true to ourselves. By taking the time to reflect on our values, beliefs, and personality traits, we can identify the qualities that we want to cultivate and work towards developing them. This can be a challenging process, but it is ultimately rewarding because it allows us to live our lives in a way that is authentic and meaningful to us.

Another reason why it is important to choose our own character traits is that it can help us build strong relationships with others. When we are true to ourselves, we are better able to connect with others on a deeper level and form genuine friendships and connections. On the other hand, if we try to fit in with a particular group or conform to certain social norms, we may find that our relationships are superficial and lack depth.

The way we dress and interact with others can also be related to our character. Our appearance can give others clues about our personality, and our behavior can reveal our true character. For example, if someone is always dressed in a certain way or speaks in a particular accent, others may make assumptions about their character based on these factors. Similarly, if someone consistently behaves in a certain way, others may judge them based on this behavior.

One example of how a person's character was judged by their behavior is the story of the Little Red Riding Hood. In this fairy tale, the wolf is able to trick the little girl into revealing her whereabouts by asking her about her character traits, such as her cunning and resourcefulness. The wolf then uses this information to outsmart the girl and eat her. This story highlights the importance of being careful about what we reveal about ourselves to others, as our character traits can be used against us if we are not careful.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Limiting car usage has lots of important advantages. By limiting car usage, we can, lower harmful greenhouse gas levels, reduce smog, and improve our environment and society. It wont happen immediately, but i do believe that if we start to limit car usage, that it will greatly benefit the world.

To begin with, cars cause a lot of the problems we are having with harmful greenhouse gas. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Paragraph 5, Source 1) Greenhouse gas emmisions are extremely harmful to the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases harm the earth's atmoshphere and we as humans, need the atmosphere to protect us from harmful radiation. By limiting car use, you are technically saving the planet and everyone on it.

Second of all, cars cause smog. Smog is extremely harmful to breathe in and is also bad for the environment. For example, in Paris, France, the government enforced a driving ban to alleviate the thick smog. After a few days of less cars on the road, the smog cleared up! (Source 2) This proves that if we didn't have cars in the cities that have smog such as Beijing and Paris, then smog would be much less of a problem and cities would be a much more healthy and safe place to live. Therefore, limiting cars results in less smog.

The last reason that limiting car usage is beneficial is that it will improve the environment and society. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth, sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramtically cut traffic; and new restaraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Source 3) This shows that by reducing car usage, it has helped the city's economy and created a better place to live for its citizens. Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company, envisioned a world where personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He saw a world that would ""save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety,"" (Source 4) This shows that by reducing car usage, the environment and society can be improved drastically.

All in all, I strongly believe that by reducing car usage, we can make the world a better place. By doing so, we can limit harmful green house gas, reduce smog, and change society for the better. These are only a few of the advantages of limiting car usage but you can already see why it is such a good idea. I hope you can take this information and make the world a better place.

"Why online classes are an innovation!

Generic_Name 3/9/20

Online classes have been an option for students since the online revolution in the early 2000's. But, some speculate that online classes are a waste of time and money, while others feel that online classes are the answer to their prayers. Many students want to learn as much as they can, but sometimes their schedules are filled to the brim with classes. Other students just cannot attend classes at all! This is where online classes come in. Online classes are beneficial to students who cannot attend regular classes; who live far from the school; and who want to take more classes than their schedule allows.

Some people have disabilities that do not allow them to go places very often. Nowadays, schools have become more friendly to disabled people. But people still feel uncomfortable when going to a school. Online school is a benefit for students who cannot attenda regular school. n Some people in wheelchairs, for example, hate going to school because thye feel uncomfortable around people who were taller than they were. The county that they lived in offered online classes, and they used those instead of going to a regular school. Most school districts offer online courses, and anyone has access to them. Even if someone just does not feel comfortable going places and interacting with others face-to-face, they have access to online schooling, and get the same education and even more classes than regular school students have.

College is always appealing, mainly towards high school seniors who will be entering the work force after high school. But colleges offer different subjects, and not all of them have the same courses. Online colleges are beneficial to students who live far from school. Many people do college searches,and can not find any colleges in their state that had the course they were looking into. They did not want to be far from home, so they looked up some colleges out of state that offered the same course they wanted to take. They found an online course at an out-of-state college, and did not have to leave home to attend college! This does not just apply to colleges, out-of- county high schools, and even middle schools offer courses not available in one direct county. Online classes make it easy to take a course that is not within a students county or state.

There are other benefits to online schooling than just distance. When a student makes their schedule for the next school year, sometimes it fills up quick, and a student may wish to take a course that they cannot take in school. Online classes are a benefit to students who do not have more room in their schedule for extra classes. Some people who are interested in space exploration and astronomy, could not an advanced astronomy class beacuse their schedules were filled with other advanced math and science classes, along with their normal core classes. But they were able to take that astronomy course online, and they love it. Onine classes make it easier to take the classes you want, and not have to make up the classes that you need in the following years. Some counties even offer classes that the rest of their state does not offer!

Taking an online class is benficial in a variety of ways. People with disabilities and who are uncomfortable in public now can go to school in the safe haven of their own homes! Students who live too far from the school that they would like tro attend can now register and take that schools online classes. Students can now also learn more advanced and uncommon subjects from home and still take their regular classes at school. People who are more comfortable at home, who want to take a class from a school far from them, and students who want to learn more can now use online classes to do just that! Now the student can use this awesome resource to their advantage!",0,persuade_corpus,0

The author lets us know that "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with charactheristic of the facial muscles.""

I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions because the author gives a lot of detail from the texts and lets us know that ""the software can even identify mixed emotions."" It even lets us know that each expression is compared against a neutral face.

For an example, you can most likely tell how you're friend is felling simply by there look on his or her face. ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" They even let us know that his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

Next they let us know that ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instutor."" the author even lets us know that they have ""the same technology can make computers- animated faces more expresssive for video fames or video surgery.

Last the author lets's us know about while were looking in the mirror you should raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrikling at the corners of your eyes Finally raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes. The text even tells us what ""muscles are called there called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus it makes crow's- feet around your eyes.""

The last thing is that in the end of the text it let's us know that the author says ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. In the text it also let us know that making faces could reveal a lot abot the science of emotions.

"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:

Hey, y'all! Today we're gonna talk about why it's important for humans to set their aims too high when they're trying to achieve their goals. Like, think about it, if you aim too low, you're only gonna get what you aimed for, but if you aim too high, you might get something way better!

First of all, let's talk about what happens when you aim too low. Like, if you want to get good grades in school, but you only aim for a C+, you might end up getting a C+, but that's it. You won't get any better than that. And that's not really worth it, right? You might as well aim for an A or a B, then you'll have a better chance of getting it.

But, on the other hand, when you aim too high, you might be surprised at how far you can go! Like, if you want to be a professional basketball player, but you aim for the NBA, you might not make it, but you might end up playing for a college team or even a minor league team. And that's still way better than if you had only aimed for the local rec league.

Another thing to consider is that when you aim too high, you're more likely to work harder and put in the effort to get there. Like, if you want to be a doctor, but you only aim for a job at the local hospital, you might not study as hard or put in as much effort as if you aimed for a top-tier medical school. And that's gonna make a big difference in the end!

So, in conclusion, setting your aims too high can lead to bigger and better things than if you aimed too low. And even if you don't reach your goal, you'll still end up farther ahead than if you had only aimed for something easy. So, go ahead and aim for the stars, y'all! You never know what you might achieve! 😃",1,llama2_chat,4

It wouldn't be fair because ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" That means if the president gets the most popular votes, it won't matter.

Back then, presidents wouldn't accept the Electoral College. ""What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" They all thought that it wouldn't be fair if the popular votes wouldn't count and the Electoral College has its defenders. The thing that's wrong with the Electoral College is because ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" So if someone were to vote for a president, they would be voting for a slate of the 34 Democratic electors. After that, they pledged it on the president that they voted for.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" It's because of the winner-take-all system that happens also on each state. So candidates think they know they aren't going to win and never spend time on other states as well. People also think that the Electoral College is unfair because they never get to see the candidates and they won't know who they're going to vote. People only relied on Bob Dole. His goal was to ""Abolish the electoral college!""

When people also vote for a presdential canidate they actually vote for the slate of electors. Which was why Gore had more popular votes than Bush, yet he had fewer electoral votes. But there is one way to settle a dispute of the outcome of an Electoral College vote. ""it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The Electoral College also has a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal but has enough electoral votes to vote for president.

So now we all know how the Electoral College is unfair. Because of the constant votes that don't matter at all yet they always make sure to vote that president and all of the popular votes wouldn't matter. That's why I want to change to popular votes than the Electoral College does. All we need to do is work together to over come the Electoral College so the votes can be fair and we would want to vote for the president that we want.    ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Seagoing Cowboy

Have you ever thought about being a Seagoing Cowboy. If you haven't maybe you should. As a Seagoing Cowboy you can help people, animals, and more. Seagoing Cowboys you travel a lot. you travel to places like China, Greece, Europe, and even Venice,Italy. You also take care of animals while shipping. You can feed them and bathe them. There is also lots of sight seeing you get to tour places like excavated castles the Panama canal and more.

In paragraph six Luke had to travel across the Atlantic Ocean for two weeks. He fed and watered the animals two or three times a day. He also had to clean the stalls. He was kept busy on that ship. He was used to being worked all of the tim on his aunt Katie's farm.

In conclusion I think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is sometimes dangerous, but fun most of the time. The Seagoing Cowboy program is fun you should try it. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Extending school one and a half hours each day has been a topic of debate in recent years. Some argue that it would provide students with more time to learn and improve their academic performance, while others believe it would cause students to become burned out and disengaged. In this essay, I will explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of extending school each day, discuss the positive impacts on student learning, explore the potential for students to enjoy further sports and activities, and analyze how it can motivate students.

One of the main benefits of extending school each day is that it would provide students with more time to learn and improve their academic performance. With more time in the classroom, teachers could provide more personalized attention to students, allowing them to receive additional help and guidance where they need it. Additionally, students would have more time to complete assignments and projects, which could lead to higher quality work and better grades.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to extending school each day. One concern is that students may become burned out and disengaged if they are in the classroom for too long. This could lead to decreased motivation and a lack of interest in learning. Additionally, some students may struggle to balance their extracurricular activities and personal lives with the extended school schedule.

Despite these potential drawbacks, there are also positive impacts that extended school could have on student learning. For example, students may have more time to participate in group projects and collaborative activities, which could help them develop important communication and teamwork skills. Additionally, students may have more time to explore new subjects and interests, which could lead to a more well-rounded education.

Another potential benefit of extending school each day is that it could provide students with more time to enjoy sports and activities. For example, students could have more time to participate in team sports or clubs, which could help them develop important social skills and build strong relationships with their peers. Additionally, students could have more time to pursue individual hobbies and interests, which could lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

Finally, extending school one and a half hours each day could also motivate students. By providing students with more time in the classroom, teachers could provide more personalized attention and support, which could help students feel more engaged and motivated to learn. Additionally, students may feel more confident in their abilities and more likely to take on challenging tasks if they",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"Dear principal

I think you should let us kids bring our phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times because what else do we have to do we talk to our friends at lunch anyway plus it would be a lot quieter in the lunch room and if there turned off in class you would not have to worry about us using them anyway. Plus if we where to use them in class the teachers would take them from us and turn it in to you then our parents would have to come get it and we would be band from bringing it to school for the rest of the year that would work to i am positive that it would. Even if you do not make that a policy we will text during lunch and class anyway so either way where still texting it's a wining situation for us that is but not so much for you a very good time to let us text would be in the morning during tag because we don't do anything in tag anyway except for Tuesday Wednesday and Thursdays.

But still we have Monday and Friday to text in tag but we should get to text during lunch everyday because all we do is eat and talk anyways and that's my final decision to the policy.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives.

People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc.

Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.

Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving.

As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy BuzzMaven Labs, says ""[He] came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph."" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of ""[...] the rusty red Camaro [tailgating] the minivan full of kids."" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to.

"Self Driven Cars

A car that dirves its self? That's outrageous. For decades humans have been driving cars in order to get where they need to go. This talk of self driven cars is absolutely rediculous. First of all, people enjoy driving. second, the car doesnt even drive completly by itself. Lastly, even if you wanted one, its not availiable every where in the counrty. I beleive this car would be a waste of your time and money.

People Enjoy driving. Driving is something that every teenager that i know cant wait to do. Its freeing and relaxing. If your angry just go on a drive and mabey youll feel better after wards. If your sad, go on a drive. People enjoy driving so much because they know that they are in control of what happens.

Wow. The car does not even drive its self completely. According to the article, driverless cars can only do basiC driving skills. Such as: steering , braking,and accelerating by them selves. Which means they would need help if there were to be an accident or people working on the road. They say that the car will alert you when it needs your help, but that means youll just be sitting thre waiting for your turn to drive. Quick question ,who wants to do that? That would be extremely boring and a waste of your time and money. Then, according to the atricle, you would have to have yor hands on the wheel at all times. So you would litterally be sitting in the car just looking out of the window until its your turn to drive.

Lastly, why in the world would you get a car that you couldnt drive anywhere you wanted to go? The article specifically states that only three states and a district allow driverless cars. this is because if you were to get into an accident, they wouldnt know who to put the blame on; you or the maufacturer. That is definetly a saftey hazard if you ask me cause if it is the manufacturer alot of people could get hurt. But besides that why drive buy and expensive car tht you can only dirve on one side of the counry?

In conclusion, the idea of these driverless cars are rediculous because people enjoy driving,they dont dirve completly by themselves and they aren't avaliable everywhere. I beleive that driverless cars are a waste of your time and money. We should just stick to the same old stuff weve been doing. If we let technology take over the one thing we can control then it would take over our entire lives.                              ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"To whom it may concern, I have recently been enlightened on what Electoral College is all about. According to ""What Is the Electoral college?"" Electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and the election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. As quoted also from ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register.

First of all, the Electoral College should be kept because no, one region has the ability to elect a president. A certain region can gather all it's people to favorite one of the candidates, but it still won't be enough to reach a biased conclusion in the final election. The candidates also cannot count on one of their favorite states or rven regions for them to win because, with only regional or state appeal, it will become unlikely for them to be a successful president.

In addition, having The Electoral College will ensure that the larger states can't overrule the smaller state based on population. It balances the weight of more populated states to smaller populated states. This is good because now, the smaller populated states will feel that they actually have power in the Election process instead of feeling left out due to a larger population. This is also significant because now the candidates won't aim their campaigning only towards the higher populated states. They will go all around the country trying to emphasize their importance in winning the campaign.

In conclusion, the obvious solution here is to keep using the Electoral College process. It not only ensures that one state or region does not have enough votes alone to sway the election, it allows the smaller populated states to have just as big of a say in the election as the larger states. The procedure of using The Electoral college has been around for quite a while now and it's clear why. It is the most beneficial way of ensuring that the right candidate will get into office, based off of the right terms.            ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Albert Schweitzer was a prominent figure in the medical and humanitarian fields, known for his dedication to improving the lives of others. One of his famous quotes was ""Example is the only thing in influencing others,"" which suggests that the best way to influence others is through direct action and setting a positive example. However, I disagree with this statement and believe that influencing someone does not necessarily require being a direct example for them.

While it is true that people are often influenced by the actions and behaviors of those around them, it is not always the case that they must directly observe and emulate those examples. For instance, people can be influenced by the actions and behaviors of others even if they are not physically present or directly observing them. This can happen through media, such as television and the internet, which allow people to learn about and be inspired by the actions and behaviors of others.

Furthermore, even when people are directly observing a positive example, it is not always the case that they will be influenced by it. People have their own unique experiences and perspectives, and they may not always be able to relate to or understand the experiences of others. Additionally, people may be influenced by negative examples or by the absence of positive examples, which can be just as powerful in shaping their behavior and attitudes.

In conclusion, while it is true that people are often influenced by the actions and behaviors of those around them, it is not always the case that they must directly observe and emulate those examples. People can be influenced by the actions and behaviors of others through media, and even by negative examples or the absence of positive examples. Ultimately, the most effective way to influence others is to understand their unique experiences and perspectives, and to provide them with the support and resources they need to achieve their goals.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Today there are programs like NASA that are always looking for ways to explore our planets next to us. We have already sent probes and rockets to mars for exploration, but in over 30 years we havent sent one space craft to Venus, despite it being called ""Earth's twin"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and density, but it is the one of the most inhospitable planets that humans can step on. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports his idea well by explaining the benefits of exploreing Venus despite it being so cruel for humans to walk on.

In pargraph three the author quotes that, ""almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then what we experence on Earth."" The author first explains the inhospitably of Venus to then explain that when we adapt to the conditions there are plenty of benefits and knowledge to gain from the planet. In pargraph four the author quotes that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The author explains us the value of exploreing Venus to include the fact that there could be life forms we have never saw before that have lived only on Venus. Comeing back to how the author supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it offers.

In pargraph five the author explains ideas NASA has that could eventually take us and machines to Venus. he quotes that, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would advoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""

The author adds the quote in beacuse he wants to reinforce the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it offers. But he also looks at the downsides to hovering 30 miles above the landscape, citeing that from souch a high distance light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere and that researchers can't take samples of rock, gas, or anthing else, from a distance. The author supports his evidence by looking at bolth sides of the problem and offering possible solutions to them.

He contunes in pargraph seven citeing other NASA approaches to haveing machines last longer on the surface of Venus. That if by useing mechanical computers and simplifyed electronics made of silicon carbide they can withstand the heat alot longer. In comparson to todays modern electronics which don't use gears and levers that can be built to withstand heat. The author cites this beacuse he wants the reader to know NASA is thinking of possible ideas of sending a durable machine to Venus, to withstand the chaos of the surface and send data back to people on Earth.

In ""The Challenge of Exploreing Venus,"" the author supports his idea well that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He first explains what the dangers are like. Then explains all the benefits of exploreing Venus. Lastly he explains ideas on how to overcome the challenges to send people and machines to gather data about Venus.

"""HONK! BEEP BEEP!."" ""Hey! What are you doing!? You're causing a traffic jam!"" What causes a traffic jam? Cars. They get us from point A to B for sure but, do we really need to rely on them that often? I don't think so. As we limit our car usage, the air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happens, and road rage? Gone.

Limiting car usage have many benitfits, such as the air pollution lowers. In some countries, for example Paris, they ban driving due to smog. fter near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city. As of that Monday, they would fine motorists with even-numbered license plates a 22-euro fine($31). The effect of this was that public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday.

In Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day leaving the streets traffic jam free. It was their third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted. It didn't stop people from participating even though gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bike with his wife. This campaign began back in the mid-1990s. Without cars, parks and sports centers have bloomed throughtout the city. They even fixed the uneven pitted sidewalks and replaced them with smooth sidewalks. A city of 7 million, rush hour have dramatically cut traffic as they have their car-free day.

As for the United States, President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses as each year go by. Another study has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39 year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak's research has found. Without cars, people are expected to walk more and car pool with friends or take buses. This will dramatically decrease greenhouse gas and air pollution. In Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Moter Company, has laid out a bussiness plan where they create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and impove safety.

In conclusion, by not driving a car, air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happen, and no traffic jams. From different sources, different effects happens when cars are banned. In Paris, smog is a thing in the past, no traffic jam for a city of 7 million in Bogota, and in Barcelona, public transportations are connected and is faster to get to point A to point B. By not driving cars, we won't cause car accidents and it will improve safety for everyone. Walking never cause problems and can get you anywhere.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2

Should cell phones be allowed in school?

Dear Principal,

I know you are considering to whether or not to allow cell phones in school. Well I have some suggestions on why we should be allowed. First of all, mostly what is thought about for the purpose of cell phones is just to talk and text. Though, the real purpose on why we were given cell phones in the first place at all was for emergencies. I think we should be allowed to have or use cell phones in school during lunch or free periods is because we might have an emergency to deal with, sometimes we just want to talk and hang with friends, and/or we have to contact our parents on where we are, with whom, and if or if not we will be at home or somewhere else.

The most important reason I think we should be allowed to have cell phones in school is for dealing with emergencies. Let's just say something very unfortunate happens like a loved one has passed away, you have to be contacted immediately in order to know because our parents may not be able to reach us or pick us up because of such misfortune. Also, maybe your parents are stuck at work so they need to call you to get a carpool because they know they won't be able to pick you up from school.

Another reason I see fit for allowing us to use cell phones, is because sometimes we students like to relax and just hang or talk with friends. Some friends might not have any classes together especially in middle school and high school since our schedules are different most of the time. So, we want to talk to them at every chance we get but since they might be going somewhere you may not be able to communicate personally so that's where the cell phones come in.

Lastly, we should be allowed to use our cell phones because may be we need to call or contact our parents on our whereabouts. Such as, maybe you are going to go over to a friends house to work on homework, a project, etc. Also, to tell our parents maybe we're going to be a little late coming home because of an after school class, club, or tutoring session.

So in conclusion, if you can kindly so review or consider some of my ideas on allowing cell phones I and the student body would really appreciate it. You never know what might come up so it's good to have such a device with you at times. After all, we students might need it for emergencies, to contact our parents on our whereabouts, or sometimes just to talk to friends.

Sincerely,

A fellow student",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Venus is our closest planet to us besides Mars (sometimes) but does that mean that we should start to think about the possiblities of us landing there? The author of the article ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" is suggesting that we should go forward and try to study and hopefully go to Venus despite the dangers that are capable of happening. Venus may be our ""twin planet"", but it is very different from Earth. I think the author of this article supports this idea very much.

There are a couple reasons on why I think the author supports this article. One is because he talks about how Venus could have been. Venus is the most Earth-like planet that we know in our solar system but they don't exactly know if it once was like us or not. Astronomers think that Venus was once covered with oceans and it could even have supported forms of life. The author also talks about the features of Venus today. The author points out that the plant has some siliar features as us like valleys, mountains, and craters. The author ends the paragraph ,where he talks about this, with this sentence, ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making a mission both safe and scientifically productive."" This makes me think that the author is trying to get us informed about the options that it could take to make this Venus situation be safer.

This information we know about the planet is very different than ours. One of the details that the author points out is that it has a thick atmosphere of amost 97% carbon dioxide. Another thing he says is that the clouds are made up of sufuric acid and that the tempature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The author makes it clear that the conditions on Venus are very extreme and it would make a bad environment for us. With this information, the author makes it clear that NASA is still trying to find a possible solution for saftey reasons and informational reasons.

One of the ways that NASA is trying to study venus is by sending a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" They would have to be in the air to fly over storms and get out of the way of the unfriendly ground conditions. In the air, the tempature would still be way too hot but they think that humans would be able to survieve that condition. The air pressure in the air will be close to the same pressure thats on the earth. At the end of the paragraph that talks about this , the author says that obviously these are not the best conditions but they are survivable for humans.

These are my claims on why and how the author is telling us that he supports the idea. He talks about the similarities and differences about the planet and Earth. He also talks about the possibilities this could happen in the future once we get more information. This is why I think that the author is supporting the idea of studying Venus even if the conditions are bad.   ",0,persuade_corpus,0

"The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is often referred to as Earth's twin. It is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. A difference would be a thick atmosphere. NASA's solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Humans are curious of what Venus is like.

In paragraph 4, Venus could have once had oceans. It could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Venus today still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. It has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientists were able to study Venus, it would help us undertsnad the planet more.

It is hard to study Venus because the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Also even more challenging are the clouds. They consist of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. On Venus's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus's atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

In paragraph 5, it states that NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. They want scientists to be able to float above the fray. It says that solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. These are not easy conditions, but are survivable for humans. It is important for them to get up close and personal despite the risks. There are many researchers that are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to study Venus.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is important. Venus is like Earth's twin. It is possible to humans to study this planet. NASA has ideas that will help find ways to study Venus. Technology can also help us in these experiments. In conclusion, Venus would be just another planet like Earth. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, y'all! Today we're gonna talk about how people throughout history have done some pretty cool stuff and how it affects us today. Like, can you believe that some dude named Leonardo da Vinci was like, a total Renaissance man? He was an artist, inventor, engineer, and scientist all rolled into one! He even designed flying machines, which is basically like a drone but way cooler.

And then there's Marie Curie, who discovered radium and polonium. Like, whoa! That's some serious science stuff right there. She won two Nobel Prizes for it, which is like, the highest honor you can get in science. Her work helped us understand more about the structure of atoms and stuff, which is important for making new medicines and stuff.

But it's not just about science and tech. People like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malala Yousafzai have done some amazing things too. They fought for equality and education, which is super important for making the world a better place. They inspired lots of people to stand up for what's right and make a difference.

So, what can we learn from all of this? Well, I think it's pretty clear that people can do some pretty amazing things when they put their minds to it. If we keep learning from the past and building on what people have accomplished, we can make the world an even better place. Like, we could invent new ways to clean the air and water, or create new medicines to cure diseases. The possibilities are endless!

In conclusion, people throughout history have done some pretty cool stuff, and it's important to learn from them so we can make the world a better place. So, let's keep on learning and inventing and making a difference! Thanks for reading, peeps! 😎",1,llama2_chat,4
"Writing a strong and supported essay takes more than just advanced vocabulary and a plethora of facts . A strong example of this is the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". The author did not support his topic very well, because he didn't support his main idea enough, he strayed away from the topic many times, and his information is an abundance of opinions and assumptions.

First, the author brings up his topic of "" Studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". Despite this, the author only gave one full paragraph, out of the eight he wrote, on why humans would want to explore the planet ; he then preceeded to go onto the dangers of Venus, rather than why it is worth exploring. Secondly, the author ,many times, rambled on about other points that had nothing to do with his main idea. The author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that NASA is working on to explore Venus, even though his main idea is about why we should send shuttles to Venus. In the article it states "" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II"". This entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever, which shows that the author was gettting side tracked. One reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers,and not why humans should explore Venus. Finally, the supporting evidence that the author did bring up, weren't very factual or even well thought out. One of the points brought up was ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth"". The author uses the word ""probably"" which means that he doesn't know this to be a fact or not. The author also wrote ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus"" ; this is an opinion, seeing as some astronomers might heavily dislike venus. A good informative or arguementative essay provides facts to supports its ideas, rather than just guessing or presuming.

The author does not suport his ideas well, because he draws the reader away from the topic many times, he doesn't support his thesis very well, and the evidence he does bring up are opinions or assumptions. The author provides to much on the ""danger"" aspect of it, and he should focus more on the ""why"" aspect of his idea . So, it would be best if he looked over his essay and ,with his thesis in mind, start over from scratch.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Nobody is perfect. Making better decisions is something that all people can strive for. It is important that you ask for other people's opinions when you need help making a decision. The average person would say that they would take back a decision or choice they made in the past or would want to change something. The choices we make each day affect our lives going forward and for our own sake, we need to make better choices. Getting advice from multiple people can help you to avoid personal bias, see from new perspectives, and get help from qualified people.

When being tasked to make an important decision, it is important that you avoid personal bias and take other people's ideas and thoughts into account. People with biased minds often already have a decision in mind before making a decision and usually will not change their mind. In order to avoid bias and make the right choice, you have to think about all the outcomes to all decisions and ponder each one. For example, when betting on a sports team to win a game, you must think about how realistic your preferred outcome is. People who are fans of one team often bet that they will win even though that possibility is highly unlikely. Everybody has a personal bias and it is matter of controlling it. Seeking other people's opinions can help you to be unbiased and make the right decision, rather than making the more personally favorable one. Finally, allowing your mind to be clouded and biased will not help you make a better choice.

Asking for advice or opinions from others can help you see from a new perspective. When viewing a decision from others opinions, you may learn new information and realize things that you had not before. When I make a decision, I ask my parents, siblings, and friends for advice because I want to see what type of lens they are viewing my decision from. Depending on what they may say, my thoughts, ideas, and choice may all change. Seeing from other people's view may spark your imagination to think of a new choice or to understand that a certain choice is bad. Not trying to see from another point of view or believe that your choice is wrong is like having tunnel vision, one dimensional and myopic. Being able to see from multiple different perspectives can help you to make the best choice because it is not always your own or your best friend's perspective that is the best.

Getting advice from other people can help when making a decision because they may be more knowledgeable or experienced on a topic. It is important to listen to these people because they have a better understanding on the possible outcomes, pros, and cons. Conversely, you should take the advice of someone who is less knowledgeable or is less experienced on a topic into account less. For example, asking your friend who has a bad grade in science class for help on homework is not a good idea. Asking your parents, siblings, or a friend that is very good at science is a better choice. Next, people who are more experienced and have made the right or wrong decision in the past are also people that can help you make better choices because they can tell you first-hand what to do in certain scenarios. When needing to know whether you should take a class over the summer or not, asking someone who has already been in the class will have a better understanding on if you should or should not than yourself or someone who has not taken the class. The advice of more qualified people should be searched for when trying to make the best choice.

Each day you make hundreds of choices and each choice you make effects more than just yourself. They effect your parents, siblings, peers, etc. It is important that we all try to make the best choice possible each day. Asking others for their thoughts, opinions, and advice on what you should do is critical. You must avoid your personal bias when making choices, try to see things from a new perspective and take in the wisdom of someone who is more knowledgeable and experienced than you into account. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I agree with that decision because i think it would make the school better. And also,I think it will help the students communicate better and make more bonds with other students. Maybe some students dont have anything to do after school or some of them just feel like they don't fit in so they dont do anything school wise, So the Principal making that decision is a good idea to me.

At my school a lot of dumb stuff happens so i feel like if most of the students were to do different activities with each other and help each other out it would help us as a school. If i was to choose a activity i would help make the year book it sounds fun to make! i would enjoy that activity a lot.

However, I do not think all the activity (except sports) should be everyday. Some students may not be able to show up, The Principal should make some of the activites only on Mondays Wednesday, and Fridays. It is also good idea to because Ur doing more than one activity and all of them are different.     ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Hey there!  As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write this essay about why having a high paying job is worth it.  I mean, who doesn't want to make lots of money and live a comfortable life, right? 

So, let's dive right in!  I think it's pretty cool how having a high paying job can allow us to travel to new places.  Imagine being able to explore new countries, cultures, and landscapes without worrying about money.  It's like, you can finally experience all the cool things you've been saving up for, like skydiving, scuba diving, or visiting the Eiffel Tower! 

But that's not all!  Having a high paying job also means you can buy stuff without having to rely on family money.  Like, can you imagine being able to buy the latest gaming console or that sick pair of sneakers without having to ask your parents for permission?  It's like, you finally get to treat yourself to something nice without feeling guilty. 

And let's not forget about the food!  Having a high paying job means you can afford to buy all the fancy foods you've been craving.  Imagine being able to indulge in a juicy steak, a plate of lobster, or a tub of your favorite ice cream without worrying about the cost.  It's like, you can finally enjoy all the rich and delicious foods you've been missing out on. 

So, there you have it!  Having a high paying job is like, the ultimate goal for any 8th grader.  It means you can travel, buy whatever you want, and eat all the food you can handle.  It's like, the key to a life of luxury and comfort.  And",1,llama2_chat,1
"The principal wants to enforce a rule for every student to stay after school and do at least one extracurricular activity. Here is why I disagree.

I think the school shouldn't enforce a rule for the students to do extracurricular activities because students may have things to do after school. Instead, the principal should make a non-mandatory after school program for the students who want to stay after school.

I disagree with the principal's idea because students may have many things to do after school. For example, students may have to babysit their siblings, do sports, or simply have lots of homework to do when they get home. The principal enforcing a rule on the students making them do at least one activity makes it so that students don't have time to do what they need to do when they come home.

The principal should make a non-mandatory after school program for the students that don't have out of school activities. For example, Student help, clubs, or sport related activities. That way, students don't feel like it's a mandatory extra 2 hours of school but instead, it's an optional way of taking part in school activities.

In conclusion, the principal should not enforce the rule of making them stay after school because the kids may have to do out of school activties. But instead, having an option of letting students stay after school if they like to.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"The author gives good reasonings on why the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The first reasoning that the author has is that way back when, Venus might have had open oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Just like Earth does, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar feartures such as moutains, valleys, and craters. NASA has an exquisset idea for sending humans to study Venus. Just picture an enormous blimp-like contraption that hovers 30 or so miles above all of the landscapes, all of the storms, we would be care free. Nothing to worry about except for the drastic temperatures of 170 degrees Fahrenheit that we all would still have to endure while we're there, but no worries we could always just fan eachother with a paper fan.

It 'll work the same I'm sure. We would have solar powered appliences so we wouldn't have to sorry about the everyday hassal of having to plug in, detangle, of trip over any more cords. This would be a major change for all of us drastic in fact, but still survivable. NASA has had some simpified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulated the Venus's surface and has lasted for three weeks in such harsh and mild conditions. NASA would be making our living situations a lot easier to handle of Venus by creating all of this new technology today in this age/era.

In clonclusion, NASA has outstanding creations that would be outstandingly suitable for the human race to live on Venus. Worry free, hardly any bills to pay, and all liveable cercumstances.

"Hey there! 

So, you know how sometimes you're like, ""Man, I wish I could just take my classes from the comfort of my own home""?  Well, distance learning is a thing now, and it's like, a real thing!  And I'm here to give you the lowdown on whether it's a good idea or not. 

First off, let's talk about the pros. !  Like, you can learn from the comfort of your own home, in your pajamas, with a bowl of popcorn .  Okay, maybe that's not a real thing, but you get the idea. You can learn at your own pace, which is super helpful if you're a visual learner or if you need a little extra time to understand something. Plus, you can save money on transportation and lunches .

But  let's not forget the cons. ...  Like, what if you get distracted?  You know how easy it is to get sucked into your phone or TV when you're at home?  And what if you don't have a dedicated space to learn?  It's hard to focus when you're in a messy room with a bunch of noise . And let's not even get started on the lack of personal teaching . You know how sometimes you need that extra help or clarification from a teacher?  Well, you might not get that with distance learning.

So, in conclusion , distance learning can be a good thing if you're disciplined enough to stay focused and organized.  But if you're easily distracted or need a lot of face-to-face interaction, it might not be the best choice for you . It's all about finding the right balance and making sure you're",1,llama2_chat,3
"Asking others for advice is like studying before the night of a test; it is a fantastic idea! When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Asking many different others for advice is a wonderful idea, for it can boost ones confidence, gives you more than one opinion, and be less stressful.

To begin with, asking others for advice is a marvelous idea, for can boost confidence. It may help you feel very good about the decision you are going to make, also if you ask others and they give good feed back on your decision. There will be many times where people you ask for advice on may tell you that you are picking the right choice. For example, my younger brother is playing basketball for a travel team. On this team they have an A team which is good and the have a B team which is not as good. My brother was placed on the B team and he wants to woke hard and be able to get on the A team, with him having many different others to support his decision that will boost his confidence and he will want to do better.

Another reason why asking others for advice on something is good is, for it gives you more than one opinion. You can get many different perspectives from this, you can see what they would do and what they would not encourage. You can also see the many different options you may have during the situation, and you can decide on what is best for you. For example, if your mother told you to clean up and you do not want to and you ask more than one person for advice on what you should do. The many different people may advise you that cleaning up is the best decision to make in this situation.

The last reason on why i think asking others for advice is the best decision is because it can be extremely less stressful. You do not have to stress for days or even hours on what the best decision is when you can ask others for advice. You also do not have to think the situation is all on your hands and that you can not deal with it. For example, say your school loaned you a computer and a charger for it at the beginning of the year. It is coming to the end of the year and you lose your charger the day before you are supposed to turn it in. This situation has became very stressful and you may not know what to do, but you can ask others for advice and you can make the best choice on when you will buy another charger.

However, while many people ask for advice from other people to make the best decision, many other people would rather not ask for any advice at all. Not asking for others advice can be good, for you do not second guess yourself or your decision, it shows your independent and do not need others input, and shows you can keep everything under control without people telling you what you should do.

In conclusion, people all around the world recommend asking others for advice and sometimes it is the best choice to do in some cases, for it boost confidence, gives more than one opinion, and causes less stress. I personally think that asking for ones advice helps you make a better choice.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Using technology to read's student's emotional expressions is a good way of being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions. There is a new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising applications for a variety of industries. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ''action unit.'' The Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists Dr. Paul Eckman, who he is the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman ''has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example , your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. In the article '' Making Mona Lisa Smile .''

Eckman (paragraph 3).

It says in the article '' The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions.'' Huang, (paragraph 4)

In fact, us humans perfrom the same kinds of impressive ''clculation'' every day. For instance, you can probaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on there face. The author talks about how '' Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, So computers need to understand that, too.'' Huang, (paragraph 6)

Also in the article it says '' It's all about those muscular action units. They even indiccate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth.''

"Dear Principal,

Community service can be very rewarding to a students life. Many think of it as boring or stupid, but it can have a lot of positive effects on a persons personality and social life. Community service can create, in some students, respect and responsibleness that was not acquired before. In the end, it could help them learn the skills they need for their dream profession. It also makes the student more of a possibility for scholarships to a certain college or university with service hours on their application.

Very few teenagers actually participate in community service, and most who do don't do it often. This is because most students believe that it is a waste of time and takes away from the time they could use to play video games or hang out with their friends. In my opinion, if you make the service seem fun more students will get involved. Also if they are allowed to be with someone they know or are friends with they are more than likely to want to participate in whatever community service is being performed.

I believe community service can become useful and I strongly agree that it should become required of all students.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principle,

Students should be allowed to have cell phones in school but to turn them off during class time. The policy is a great idea in a plethora of ways. Students stay out of trouble and not have to go through vigorous punishment. Also to have fun and still have the learning skill they need to succeed in life. Policy number one is the best choice for the school.

It is a very reasonable policy because students can have their phones and have their class time as well.

Instead of texting in class they can text in the hallway so it does not disturb the class room environment. That way the teacher's can teach the lesson and respect other students learning. If the policy is not put in place students will text in the class room when they have a slight chance of not getting caught unlike the hallways where there are teachers. The student would not be learning anything because they could not text outside of class. So when the students does get caught the teachers would have to stop the lesson and stop other students learning. Thus, texting outside of class helps students learn more and be more productive during classes.

Some students get in trouble because they have their cell phones. Students could be sent down to the principle's office to call parents about the situation. The problem is taking time out of the principle's plans as well as the students learning. This policy can prevent this situation from happening. If the student does not go down to the principle office their phones would be taken away instead. Making the student rebel and get sent out of class and get set home with out of school suspension for rude behavior. This circumstance can be prevented with the 1st policy. Making this rule will allow them to stay in school learning instead of being in the principle's office.

Without students having their cell phones there will be no learning in the class rooms. Students need time to text, it does not have to be in the class room it can be in the hallway at lunch. The students do not learn during those times anyway. Making this policy will benefit the students and the teachers. Without all of the mishap and the drama.

"Some people believe that The Face on Mars was created by aliens. It's good to use your imaginations, but sadly, that wouldn't be the case. Most to even all evidence proves that The Face is simply a natural landform on Mars, similar to natural landforms on Earth. It's a common happening, and the most logical answer.

Us scientists at NASA have been researching The Face for years. Sure, the first picture of The Face did resemble that of a human face, or an Egyptian Pharaoh as it says in paragraph 2 of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", but since then we've been able to get better, higher-quality pictures that show that what made The Face look like a face was simply shadows. The Face is a landform on Mars, and that's simply it. It's similar to ""landforms common around the American West"", as it states in paragraph twelve, it's the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" here on Earth.

If that doesn't convince you that it's not aliens that created The Face, hopefully this will. In paragraph 5 of the article on The Face, it states ""Some people think the Face is 'bona fide' evidence of life on Mars -- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This isn't true. If NASA were to find life on Mars, it would benefit us. We wouldn't have a reason to hide it. As proof, that's also stated in paragraph 5, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Now, if defenders of our budget wish that there were ancient civilizations on Mars, don't you think we wouldn't hide it? This shows that it would benefit us if it were that, proving further that aliens aren't the creators of The Face.

If you're still not convinced, look at the picture we took of The Face on April 5, 1998, ""when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time"". NASA got a picture ""ten times sharper than the original Viking photos"", as stated in paragraph 7. This means that it was much easier to see The Face, and what it actually was. The pictures revealed something amazing... the Face was ""a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I know, shocking! But these are just the facts. Some argued that is was cloudy that day on Mars, so ""alien markings were hidden by haze"", as it states in paragraph 8. So we took a better picture on April 8, 2001 - an uncloudy day on Mars - showing, again, that it was just a landform. Nothing more to it.

In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform on Mars, similar to those here on our home planet, Earth. As far as anyone knows, even NASA, there are no life-forms on Mars of any kind that made The Face. As it says in paragraph 12, the pictures we took on April 8 were so high-quality that """"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"""" If there were any kind of aliens or alien markings on the Face, or creating the Face at that time, you would have been able to see it in that picture. The Face ""is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"", landforms commonly seen here on Earth. That's all there is to it. No aliens. No magic. Just natural happenings, that's simply all the Face is. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Hi. My name is STUDENT_NAME. I am a student at SCHOOL_NAME and I am part of the Student Body Council. I have a strong opinion on the two policies that you have asked the Student Body Council to deliberate on and give you our opinions. I believe that Policy 1, Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, is the best choice. Now let me tell you why.

First of all, if you choose Policy 2, Do not allow students to have phones at school at all, is the worst option, I believe. I have done research and according to Psychologist OTHER_NAME, ninety percent of schools that do not allow phones at school have unhappy children which eventually affects their behavior and their attitude toward other kids, teachers, and administrators.

If a student has to go to after school because he has to make up a test, that student would have to call his parents. If you do not allow phones at school he cannot call his parents which can eventually result in him getting grounded because his parents didn't know that he had to stay after school and were extremely worried about him. It could also result in him walking home which is a huge risk because he could get hit by a car or kidnapped.

I agree with Policy 1 because if students abide by that policy than there would be no reason to take the phones away. Of course if a student doesn't abide by the policy, he or she should get his or her phone taken away and his or her parents would have to pick it up from the school.

I hope you listen to my opinion about this matter because it is not fair if we don't get to use the right to use our phones, when we already have that right. Please listen, think, and discuss with other students about what policy they think should be enforced.

All for the best,

"Have you ever been in a loud, tedious, and obnoxious environment? Have you ever lacked proper individual assistance? If so, you qualify to relate to thousands of students who attend public schools. It is no secret that public schools are not meant for everyone. Some students learn and develop under private school systems, meanwhile others learn and mature better through homeschooling. Nevertheless, every student is different, and each student requires proper individual care, so he or she can reach their full potential. If all schools provide online learning, there could possibly be a massive raise in most students grades, which could not only benefit the students but the schools as well. I believe students will tremendously benefit from the opportunity of online courses, as revealed through, the extensive individual assistance, opportunity for less distractions, and development of self growth and individualism.

First, many students are constantly frustrated about the lack of help they receive. Students fall behind in lessons and classes, because they are not sought after and given proper help. This frustrates many students and is revealed through their grades and assessment scores. A simple and easy solution to all this would be home school. Students can learn all the material thought in class, but in a manner where assistance is provided when needed. This allows students to go at their own pace, and ask for help at any time. Lavar Ball, a well known celebrity, enrolled his youngest son into a home schooling program. Lavar believes the transition was very simple and beneficial for his son. His son is now a professional basketball player, so this proves that home schooling can be a very open and helpful resource for students.

Next, as we know, many students have a difficult time focusing in certain environments. Many classrooms are loud and obnoxious which takes away from certain students abilities to learn. Students with ADHD, and other minor illnesses need controlled situations that allows them to cancel outside noise and simply learn. However, classroom settings do not promote or support that need, and instead promote group work and class engagement. As you can see, this is harmful to the learning of many students which then leads to a drop in grades and causes specific students to loose motivation in their classwork. When taking classes online, students are in a much calmer and reliable situation, which allows them to showcase their true abilities. Once again, I believe the simple solution would be allowing students to take online courses from home, so they can be free of distractions, get individual help, and mature on their own.

Finally, I believe students develop self growth and individualism through online courses from home. When taking classes online, students are essentially working at their own pace, as oppose to, a specific schedule set by somebody else. This then leads to students learning how to manage time and working on the clock. This is a very important skill that is required in the real world, so those who inherit home schooling will get a head start. Next, students can get proper sleep, and schedule there classes at later start times. Some High Schools begin at 7:15 AM, which does not give students proper sleep. The lack of sleep then plays an important role in the lack of focus and attention students provide in class. When taking online courses, students are able to start their classes at later times, and get the proper sleep necessary. This not only allows students to thrive in the classroom, but also plays a huge role in building a healthy lifestyle. Online courses also provide students with a great sense of individualism. Students grow and learn much more about themselves when given the opportunity to work alone and control their own education.

In Conclusion, I believe students can only benefit from the idea of being home schooled, as shown through, the extensive support, efficient learning environment, and fantastic opportunity for self growth. Students are sometimes scared or hesitant to seek the help needed, so online courses and home schooling may be the perfect solutions. The great aspect of online courses is that they are optional, revealing that it can help students in positive ways. Some of the most successful individuals in the world have dropped out of public schools, and embarked on a life of their own. Online courses are an amazing resource for students, and should be taken advantage of! ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they continue learning during the break. The summer assignment should be teacher-designed because it makes things easier for the students, allows students to have an outline, how many pages they should have, and it gives them a topic to write about. If the teacher designs the summer assignment how could you go wrong?

Having a teacher-designed assignment makes it easier for the students. When summer comes it is hard for students to sit down and focus or even think about coming up with something to write they want to have fun. Students already don't want work over their break, however a teacher-designed assignment allows the students to not think as hard as coming up with an assignment.

When you have a teacher-designed assignment that means it comes with an outline which makes it less stressful for the students. When the student is given an outline they can break it down into sections which allows students to do one portion one day and then do the other portion another day.

The outline provides the student with a block of instructions unlike if it were student-designed they wouldn't even know where to begin. Knowing how many pages you need in your paper is another big part of having an outline it allows you to know what is a good stopping place. Knowing how many pages you need helps you to figure out how much brainstorming you need to do.

Teacher-designed assignments give you a topic, a starting point to get you on your way. Having this topic narrows down what you have to write about. During the summer students thoughts are limited it is difficult to come up with a topic because there is lots to choose from it would take some students all summer to think about what to write, but being given a topic makes things even more simple for students. However, most students may think that a student-designed project assignment is better for them because it gives them the freedom to talk about whatever they want in their paper.

Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they continue learning during the break. The summer assignment should be teacher-designed because it makes things easier for the students, allows students to have an outline, how many pages they should have, and it gives them a topic to write about. This why schools should have teacher-designed assignments rather than student-designed assignments.        ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"As an 8th grader, I think it would be really cool if businesses adopted a four-day work week with 10 hours of work per day. I mean, who doesn't love having an extra day off to do whatever they want? But, I also know that this could have some pretty big advantages and disadvantages, especially for students.

One of the biggest advantages is that students would have more time to focus on their schoolwork. With an extra day off, they could dedicate more time to studying and completing assignments, which could lead to better grades and better opportunities in the future. Plus, they could use the extra time to get involved in extracurricular activities or volunteer in their community, which could look great on college applications.

But, there are also some pretty big disadvantages to consider. For one, students might have a harder time balancing work and school. If they're working 10 hours a day, they might not have enough time to finish their homework or study for tests. And, if they're not careful, they could end up falling behind in their classes. Plus, they might not have as much time to hang out with their friends or pursue their hobbies, which could be really tough for some students.

Another thing to consider is how this could affect student preferences for elective schools. Some students might love the idea of having an extra day off, while others might prefer the traditional school schedule. It could be really hard to please everyone, and it might be hard to decide which students to prioritize.

Overall, I think that businesses adopting a four-day work week with 10 hours of work per day could have both really cool advantages and some pretty big disadvantages. It's definitely something to think about, but I'm not sure if it's something that would work for everyone.",1,llama2_chat,1
"New technology is being made all around the world, that is changing society as we know it. One example of this technology is called Facial Action Coding System. Many people are wondering if the world should put something like this in schools so teachers can read students emotions. I think we should give this technology to teachers because this could help prevent casualties, and even the lack of school work students will do.

One reason I think the Facial Action Coding System should be in schools is because it could prevent casualties at home or at school such as school shootings and suicides. This technology could help prevent these casualties by letting the teacher know if a student is happy or upset. this meaning if a student is upset a teacher could get the student help or even help the student themselves by talking to them on why they are upset. For example students all around are getting bullied and not letting other people know how they feel or let them know they are getting bullied, so these students leave school being upset and they go home a commit suicide thinking they aren't important and thinking nobody wanted to help them. Therefore if teachers had this new technology I think teacher would be able to prevent this from happening by seeing how the student feels and therefore the teacher can talk to them and hear about what is happening. This will also make the students that do get upset feel like there are people out there that want to help them and that notice them.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System should be in schools is because the lack of school work being done because students are upset. This technology could help teachers get students to do their work or to even study, by letting the teacher know if the student is having a bad day. I think this will help because if a student is having a bad day then they won't want to do work because they are upset and just most people don't want to do work when they're upset, so if teachers had this technology I think they could talk to the students and try and get them in a better mood for themto do their work. Another reason why teachers should ge this because if a student is upset and they want to do their work, their work isn't going to beas good as if they were happy, and all teachers like to see their students with the best work.

There is new technology being made all around the world, that is changing society as we know it such as the Facial Action Coding system. This is why i think this technology should be put into schools.                 ",0,persuade_corpus,1

Failure is a term that is often associated with negative connotations. However, it is important to discuss the role of failure in individual success. Failure is a natural part of life and can be used as a learning experience to achieve success.

II. The role of failure in individual success

Failure can be seen as a stepping stone to success. When individuals fail, they are forced to reflect on their actions and identify areas for improvement. This reflection can lead to new ideas and strategies that can ultimately lead to success. Additionally, failure can help individuals develop resilience, which is a crucial trait for achieving success in any area of life.

III. Personal experience with failure

I have experienced failure firsthand in my academic pursuits. When I did not perform well on an important test, I was disappointed and felt like giving up. However, I realized that I needed to reflect on my study habits and identify areas for improvement. I sought help from my teacher and created a study plan that helped me improve my grades. Ultimately, this failure taught me the importance of perseverance and hard work, which have helped me succeed in other areas of my life.

IV. Entrepreneurial example of failure

One example of an entrepreneur who has learned from failure is Steve Jobs. Jobs faced numerous failures throughout his career, including the failure of his first company, Pixar, and the initial failure of the iPod. However, Jobs used these failures as learning experiences and continued to innovate and create successful products. His perseverance and ability to learn from failure are key factors in his success as a businessman and entrepreneur.

V. Summary and conclusion

In conclusion, failure can be a valuable learning experience that can ultimately lead to success. Personal experience and entrepreneurial examples demonstrate the importance of reflection and resilience in the face of failure. It is important to embrace failure as a natural part of life and use it as an opportunity to grow and achieve success.",1,llammistral7binstruct,1
"Dear Principal,

In my part of opinion i think that students not being able to participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is great idea. There are many kids that just want to join sports, and are not doing good in their academic or unified art classes. It is very important for us to have at least a B average in all our classes because learning more, and studying harder is something we can do so we could do sports . Also it would be an advantage to the school and for us kids. If this policy does apply, many kids will start working harder, trying harder, and improving in their academic skills. You will see a difference in grades and averages if the policy does apply to the school. It i will not be a difference that will change in a bad way ,it will be in a good way kids will be learning more, and doing more work, more homework more often because sports is a very good way of us kids having a fun time after school hours. For example, kids at our age tend to do many sports because they do not want to be home alone or bored. We like to go outside or spend time with our friends, but most of the time it's a lot of friends getting together to go outside to play a sport. Also, many of the sports that we play outdoors or indoors our school has mostly all of them and many kids try out for all the sports. They think that they will just play with a C average , that is not right. A student must have at least a B average to know that he is not just in the sport to play, but because he is working hard in classes and also in with his team. I hope i have convinced you to apply the policy.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Hey, so like, I totally think it's super important to influence others, you know? Like, it's not just about trying to get your way or anything, it's about helping people make better decisions and shape their own future. Here are three reasons why:

First, when we guide and influence others, we can help them avoid making mistakes. Like, let's say you're trying to decide on a new video game to buy, but you're not really sure which one is the best. If you can share your thoughts and experiences with someone else, they might make a better decision than they would have on their own. It's like, you're giving them a heads up, you know?

Second, sharing knowledge and ideas can help others grow and learn. Like, if you're really good at something, like playing a sport or playing an instrument, you can teach others and help them get better at it too. It's like, you're passing on your skills and knowledge to someone else, and they're gonna be like, super grateful and stuff.

And third, when we share our thoughts and ideas with others, we can help shape the future of not just ourselves, but our entire community. Like, if you're passionate about a certain issue, like climate change or social justice, you can use your voice to raise awareness and make a difference. It's like, you're helping to create a better world for everyone, not just yourself.

So yeah, influencing others is definitely important. It's not just about being bossy or trying to control people, it's about helping them make better decisions and shape their own future. And who knows, maybe one day you'll be able to look back and see how your influence helped someone else make a positive change in the world. That would be, like, totally awesome, right?",1,llama2_chat,3
"Hey there!  So, I was thinking about this whole ""wisdom and experience"" thing, and I realized that it's like, super important in life. Like, my friend Sarah has been through a lot, and she's always sharing her wisdom and experience with me. And let me tell you, it's been really helpful!

For example, last year, I was trying out for the school play, and I was really nervous. I mean, I'd never done anything like that before, and I didn't know if I was good enough. But Sarah, she's been in like, a million plays and stuff, and she gave me some advice. She said, ""Just be yourself, and don't worry about what others think. If you have fun, the audience will too!"" And you know what? It worked! I had a blast, and I got a bunch of compliments from my teachers and classmates.

But it's not just stuff like that. Sarah's also been through some tough times, like when her parents got divorced. And she's always talking about how she wishes she could go back in time and tell her younger self to be more careful, or to appreciate the little things more. And you know what? That's really made me think about my own life, and how I can learn from her experiences. Like, I've been stressing out about school a lot lately, and Sarah's always saying, ""You got this! Just take it one step at a time, and don't worry about what others think."" And it's like, she's totally right!

So yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say is that wisdom and experience are super important. They can help us make the right choices, understand things more quickly, and become stronger people. And I'm lucky to have a friend like Sarah who's always sharing her wisdom and experience with me. Thanks, Sarah! 

Anyway, I think that's all I have to say about that.  Do you have any questions?",1,llama2_chat,3

We the students of SCHOOL_NAME should be able to pick if we want to have community service. If students hear don't want to do community service then we should not have to. You are the principal and why should we have to do something that we don't want to do. Ask yourself that if you did not want to do something while you where a kid then why should you make us do it?

As students we should agree or disagree with your opinions and if we don't like what you say we have the right to object it. So if you want to make new rules then we the students should really have a say into that. What if some stude

Yes community service would be nice but the reality is that people these days are very LAZY so we should have a choice on what we do after school.

"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students would benefit themselfs by taking classes at home. Because they would be more focus with out anyother classmates around they would also focus more if they had a quite place to study or just do there work and students would have more time to do there work or get things done.

students would focus better if they did not have a other classmate talking to them. Some students can not foucs if someone else is talking it might bother them it also might bother them if other classmates are making loud noises. For example i am one of those students that when i am taking a test i can not concentrate if other students are talking.

students would have more time to study and finsh work because. They would be able to take breakes during each class. students can ask there teachers to help them study for a test or quiz they can also ask a friend to help them too. students can take a break between clases and do work for other clases.

students would focus more if they had a quite place to study like the libary or somewhere they might know that would not have much noise or taking involved. students would focus better and concentrate better they will also get there work done on time.

Inconclusion this is why schools should offer distance learnig for students because students would benefit themselfs to work alone with out any taking or classmates making noise.         ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Face The Landform?

Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, and here are those reasons.

First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting. By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that ""face"" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.

After scientists did a little research on their own, ""The Face"" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.

Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. What's the difference its just a camera. Well, that camera captured the truth about mars. For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there. Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa. So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars.

So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.            ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"How do you feel about school itself? Im guessing your not a big fan, but what if your principal said that every student has to participate in one extracurricular activity? Your probably not on board yet so i'll tell you some reasons why these activities could better you and the school. Extracurricular activities can make you new friends in school, they can help you find a hidden talent, and it can make you enjoy school more.

So how can these activities make you friends? I'll tell you. For example, if your not certain who signed up for the same thing as you, you might meet new people who have the same things in common with you. You guys both could be really good at something and thats what you talk about. Another thing is if your on a sports team the players and you could go play whatever sport outside of school. Even in school, during practice it wouldnt be nerve racking because you guys all know each other.

Everyone has a talent, just others show theirs better than others. Well the extra activities could bring out the best in you and your abilities. If you play basketball, but you dont do it that serious why not try out for the school team? Who knows you might make the team and do really good the season and then the next season you can come back better than ever. Lets say your struggling in math and you really need the extra time to do good, But after some time of the help your one of the smartest people in the class and you help people who were in your shoes.

Not a lot of people like school. Believe it im with you im not a huge fan of school myself but i still manage to enjoy it a little bit. You see, if you and some of your friends joined the same club or did the same activity do you know how much fun that would be? All of you could talk and do something you guys might enjoy like sports, yearbook, and the student council. One more thing is what if you really wanted to play for the school basketball team but your grades are holding you back? Well everyone has to do an activity so you could play and enjoy it with your friends. That doesn't mean dont worry about your grades because that always comes first.

So would you be on board with this idea? It will get you new friends, help you find something inside you that you didnt even know was there, and it will make school much more enjoyable. I think every school should use this format for these 3 reasons i stated. Even though picking something you might not be good at or you dont know is a learning curve you could still have a blast with your friends.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Why would anyone want to become a Seagoing Cowboy, you might ask. There are actually many resons why someone should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Like I said, ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy.""

If you are working as a Seagoing Cowboy, thyen you know the feeling of when you acomplish something great. It's all one big rush of happiness, excitment,and sucess. Later on in life you will get to say, ""I helped someone and I'm proud"" That is just one of the many reasons.

If you like working with animals, then this might be a job for you. When I was working for the Seagoing Cowboys program, I got to work as a watchman. When you are a watchman you have to check on the animals every hour. That was an amazing experience, trust me.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't all work all the time. You can find time to have fun like I did. I got to play exciting vollyball and baseball games. Along with that, I had time to read, box, fence, whittle, and play in table-tennis tounaments.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to visit amazing place such as I. You can get the chance to go to through the Panama Canal and tour a castle in Crete just on your way to China! That's not all! You can take a gondola ride in Italy, and see the Acropolis in Greece. Just think of all the amazing places you'll go.

When I was Seagoing Cowboy was the best time of my life. It gave me wonderful chances and a life full of excitment. It could give you that too. All you have to is join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You will not regret it, I promise.   ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Have you ever been making a decision and didn't know who to ask for advice? Well the best option is to ask multiple people. Most people make a decision after asking only one person for advice, but when you ask multiple people you're more likely to make a better choice. Asking multiple people for advice and getting different opinions is good because you can think about all the factors, you will have options rather then having one person tell you what to do, and lastly if everyone gives you the same advice its probably the best option to choose.

The first reason I believe talking to more then one person about advice is better for making choices, is that you will have options rather then having one person tell you what to do. When you only take advice from one person it can be bias as to where when you get multiple opinions you see both sides. For example lets say you were thinking about getting a dog your friends would say something like ""Yes you should get a dog they're so cute."" but your mom might say ""They are a lot of work and responsibility."" so when you ask different people you get to see both sides of a situation.

The second reason I think asking multiple people for advice is you get a bunch of different opinions. Like lets say you aren't sure if you want to be friends with someone anymore one person you ask might say ""You should just cut them off completely."" but maybe someone else might say ""You dot have to stop being friends with them just maybe dont hang out as much.""

With both of these answers in mind you have options to choose from when making a decision.

The final reason I believe that asking many people for opinions is better for making choices is when more people say the same the greater the chance of it being a good choice. For example when you are trying to choose between two things like what to get for lunch a salad or a sandwich and the majority of people are saying sandwich thats probably the one you should get.

In conclusion asking multiple people for advice and getting many opinions back is good because you can think about all the different factors, you will have options rather then having one person tell you what to do, and finally if everyone is saying the same thing its probably a good choice to make. If you are ever struggling to make a decision its better to have multiple people weigh in on the situation rather than just one.   ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I disagree with student having to have a grade B average to be able to participate in school activities because it's not so easy for some kids to keep their grades up when they also have school activities and making this new rule would be taking a lot of fun opportunities from students that have trouble with school work.

First ,I disagree because it's not easy for some kids to keep their grades up when they also have school activities. Students are going to be put under a lot of pressure if they have to keep up with school work and take school activities which could cause stress. Also students sometimes won't be able to keep up with all the work and activities after school.

Next, I disagree because making this new rule would be taking a lot of fun opportunities from students that have trouble with school work. Students could have scholarships from playing basket ball and football which are school activities and could make them successful in life but if they have to still get a grade B average then this makes it harder for them to achieve.

Students don't deserve to be put under pressure like that because its bad for their health.

"The face on Mars really is just a landform. I've seen the landform before on our very own home planet. My family and I were going to Grand Canyon for a vacation. Life had been rough so we decided we deserved to see the country a little bit. Upon arriving in Arizona, I saw hundreds of mesas, which are landforms that look like faces. I was petrified at first, until I learned they were merely landforms. The first time I saw the alledged ""Face on Mars,"" I knew it was merely a landform. I believe the Face is a landform and not an alien figure because it was exaggerated by Hollywood and the media, it would be better for NASA if it were an alien life form, and there are already lots of similar landforms on Earth.

Hollywood, its the home of the media. Of course the media will do anything for views. As soon as they found out about the Face, they jumped all over it. For instance, in paragraph 5, the author quotes, ""The 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon."" This implies that it really wasn't a big deal before it started to become popularized. Paragraph 5 also shows us that it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in magazines, books, radio talk shows, and even was told in checkout lines for 25 years. The Face was an icon of its time, and thus was twisted to seem like an alien figure.

Moving on, why would NASA want to keep an alien a secret? If NASA actually did find an alien, they would want to let the world know so that they'd have more funding. In paragraph 5, we are told that the NASA budget wishes that there was an ancient civivlization of Mars. This proves that it would help NASA pay off debts and would make them more popular in the face of the public. It is also stated in paragraph 7 that Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, had a few words to say.

""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" Jim said. This exemplifies that NASA knew it was only a landform, but they wanted to take pictures so that the public would pay them more.

A third reason for my believing is that there are already many landforms like this. The landform is called a mesa. As I said earlier, I've seen many of these landforms in Arizona. We are shown in paragraph 7 that when the picture of The face first appeared on a JPL web site, it showed that there was no alien monument, only a landform. This proves to us that sure, if you take a picture from a certain angle, it looks like a face; when you take it from a different angle, it looks like the landform that it is. This is similar to the Man on the Moon. We know that it is just a bunch of craters, making it look like a human figure. In the final section, 12, Garvin states a perfect example.

""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is an excerpt from the passage that demonstrates how the Face is no different from our landforms on Earth.

Some might say that the face is actually an alien monument, and that NASA just doesn't want the public to know. But, what they don't realize is that NASA would benefit from seeing an alien life form. The public would love it, and the money would start rolling in. The author tells us that defenders of the NASA budget actually wish that there was an ancient alien civilization on Mars.

It seems that life gets so boring for people that they make any little thing seem amazing. This is shown through the fact that people made a landform appear as an alien monument. Through all the incomplete theories, I still believe that the Face is purely a landmark. I believe this because hollywood and the media exaggerated it greatly, the discovery of alien life would actually benefit NASA, and there are many landmarks on Earth and Mars that represent the supposed ""Face of Mars.""",0,persuade_corpus,3

"How is seeking different opinions from multiple people help you make the better choice? First, asking more than one person for advice can help you choose the more benefical outcome for your future, weither it's that important or not. Second, asking your friends and family for advice could help you choose something they know you would be interested in, or like. Next, if you aren't good at choosing between multiple choices, you can ask some one after they gave you there opinion, ""why"" or ""how"", they came up with that idea. All together, these could be some of the few benefical ways to making your choice,

First off, asking more than one different person, could maybe help you decide whatever you are asking there opinion for. By stating that, everyone has different opinions, so when you're asking more than one person for help, you aren't just getting the same opinions over and over again, you are getting a variety of choices to choose from. But, while making your decisions, you can see which choices you gave everyone were choosen the most, and decide weither you want to pick that decision or not. All in all, asking others for there personal advice, can help you decide weither you like the idea of that being what you pick or not.

Nextly, another good way to determine what you want to choose is to ask your friends, and family. Personally, when I need good advice I go to my friends, and family for help. That's because, they know me the best, and they only want what's best for me. This also helps because, it's easy to talk to some one you know and trust, rather than asking some one you barley know for advice. To conclude this paragraph, one of the best ways to ask for advice is through friends, and family. You can always count on them to be there, they know you the best, and they only want what's best for you. So, when talking to some one you trust, can also help you trust there opinion.

The next thing that you can do and will help you, is ask them ""why"" they chose that answer or, ""how"" they did. This helps so that you can better understand, and get a little back ground information on why they made that decision. It makes it so that you aren't questioning why did they choose that anwser, how did they come down to that becoming something they would choose for themselves or you, and so you're not questioning if you should've picked that answer or not. All in all, since you're asking some one why they choose that, you can better understand how, or understand how they think and process answers for there outcome, so that in the future you can understand more about making decisions on your own instead of asking others.

In conclusion, from asking others such as family memebers to friends, how they have decided on that answer. Can help you make a more benefical outcome for your future. By knowing, that they only want what's best for you, that can help make you more confidence in what they chose, so that you can understand how they might process and why that's the best choice for you. All together, all this information will help you better understand how to choose what's best for you, so that in the future when you have to make harder chooses on your own you know how to do so.     ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I understand that there is an issue with cell phone during school hours. But I believe this issue is never going to go away unless we work our way around it. We are now in the twentieth century, technology is a big thing, especially to us teenagers. I believe that is a great idea to allow students to bring their cell phones to school and use them during our lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time.

I can understand why you wouldn't want to have cell phones during school hours. Some people might say it's a distraction, having students using their phones in class or their cell phones to go off during a lecture. Or some people just don't want students to have cell phones at all. But I say we should but the cell phones to good use.

Almost everybody has a cell phone, is one of the biggest technology used everyday. But I think we can do better then just using cell phones during free time and during lunch. I believe that we should use them in class. If we use projectors, computers, and other technical devices why not cell phones? Most cell phones have calculators, let you take notes, and much more. A student always have their cell phone with them, so they could study more frequently. You can't carry a notebook around all the time like you do a cell phone. You could also record a lesson and watch it or listen to it when you don't understand, sometimes just reading and going over notes isn't enough. Less people would be getting in trouble if cell phones weren't an issue. Of course there are going to be times when a child is caught not following the rules, but everyone messes up were only human. Teenagers are always going to be tempted to break the rules. If you tell them they can't use their cell phones, they are going to be tempted to do it, and some people will.

Not allowing students to have cell phones would very much upset them. Most schools make the students put their cell phones in their locker. But most of them won't, if they put their cell phone in their locker they are most likely going to forget it and leave it at school. Which would lead to more problems. Most people are very dependent to their cell phones. So telling them that can't have it will not work. Students will always have their cells phones so why not work around it and maybe use them?

But if you can't use them during class perhaps just allowing students to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times is a wonderful idea. it's nice to just have fun at school every once in awhile, especially if your cramped up in a classroom for several hours. We are young adults I believe we can handle it. I hope you take what I said into deep consideration and allow us to use our cell phones.",0,persuade_corpus,0

"Cars,the thing that all teenagers want when they turn sixteen. Driving gives a sense of freedom, but it comes with a price. Diving automotives pollutes the air with greenhouse gases. Cities like Paris, Vauban, and Bogota have some serious problems with pollution. Thats why we should limit vehicle usage.

Vauban, Germany is doing it wrong, by living in a ""car-free"" envirorment. The citizens that live here forbidden to own a car, driveway, and a home garage. There is a glimpse of light to all of you that love driving or need to drive to work. In this city, if somebody wanted to own an automotive they would have to pay an additional 40,000 dollars and live at the edge of the city limit. Pollution might be serious but you should just limit the commute to work so citizens don't have to drive so much. Think about it, if you force people that have cars to live on the city limit, but they might work in the middle of the city. I don't see the solution in that.

Paris, France, the city of love, is also the leading city in Europe of smog. ""passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe."" (Rosenthal 5).Paris is not so bad in book compare to Vauban.

It is absolutely necessary to ban texting and driving to prevent the deaths and waste of resources it causes.

Texting and driving is dangerous. A vehicle travelling at 60mph will move 88 feet in just one second. This means that if the driver looks away from the road for even a single second, they will have moved 88 feet by the time they look back. When moving at high speeds in a vehicle, a lot can happen in a single second. The vehicle could drift off the road, hit another vehicle, or even hit a pedestrian. When a driver sends or receives a text, they're not looking away from the road for just one second, or even two seconds. They're looking away from the road for five seconds.

Five seconds at 60mph is 440 feet. That's 440 feet the driver has moved without even looking at the road. This is something that happens every time someone looks at their phone to send or receive a text. This is unsafe and should be banned.

Texting and driving, though it is banned in most states, is not uncommon. Three quarters of drivers who own a cell phone have admitted to texting and driving, despite the overwhelming majority of them knowing about the dangers. At any given time 7% of drivers are using their phones while driving. The knowledge that texting and driving is dangerous is not enough to deter most people. Simply informing people that texting and driving is dangerous is not enough to prevent them from doing it; texting and driving must be banned everywhere in the country.

Texting and driving significantly increases the risk of a car accident, and accounts for a significant amount of actual accidents. Fourteen percent of all car accidents are associated with texting and driving, and it is the leading cause of car accidents, even more common than drunk driving. When a driver is texting while driving the amount of time their eyes are off the road increases significantly, by about 400%. Avoiding texting and driving could reduce the amount of time the driver has with their eyes off the road to a quarter and reduce the chances of an accident.

Texting and driving causes 3000 deaths per year in the United States alone, and costs $129 billion per year. Every year many of the people that die as a result of texting and driving are drivers other than those who are texting. Often it's passengers, pedestrians, and even other drivers who are killed by distracted driving, but most deaths are the drivers themselves. The resources that have been lost because of distracted driving could have gone to something that could help people. But instead it is wasted because distracted driving has caused car accidents that cost a significant amount of money. Distracted driving causes many deaths and wastes a lot of resources that could be used to help people.

Distracted driving is a major issue, but unfortunately, there are still some people who feel it should not be banned. It is still legal in three states and there are no national laws making it illegal. Despite 3000 deaths per year, $129 billion wasted, and it being the leading cause of accidents it is still not banned in some places. Texting while driving should be banned.

"As educational institutions and lawmakers look for ways to improve students' academic success, there is intense debate over whether student involvement in extracurricular activities should be mandated by schools or left up to each individual family. Although many would argue that it is the schools' responsibility to provide activities for students, there are several reasons why families should make this decision. 

First, extracurricular activities are often highly personal. All children have different interests and curiosities, and by allowing families to choose which extracurricular activities are right for their children, it allows children to explore the activities that genuinely appeal to their individual needs and desires. 

Second, the family has the strongest ties to the child, and deep knowledge of the child's abilities and goals. This understanding gives them the best knowledge of what activities will best benefit their child, which a school may lack. 

Finally, when extracurricular involvement is decided by the family, it brings the family closer together. Families often work together closely to decide which activities are right for their children, building an increased sense of communication and trust between the parent and child. 

Overall, extracurricular activities should be a decision left up to families, not schools. Allowing families to make this decision ensures that the child participates in activities that are tailored to his or her interests and abilities, strengthens the bond between the family, and provides the family with the most intimate knowledge of their own child.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Dear Principal,

As an A average student I have never struggled with grades. I work hard and my effort pays off. It shows on my report card too! I only play one sport and it doesn't effect my grades much. During volleyball season (That's my sport!) I have a more organized schedule with time limits which benefits me by helping me to get my homework done, but on days with lots of homework or big games I struggle to get it done and generally miss some sleep. I think the policies should not change though because for people who struggle it is important that college should still be in their future.

Sports may be the only thing that gets them there.

From experience, I know fellow classmates with low grades often have bad backgrounds and the families behind them are not very supportive. That is not always true but it is common. That means they need a scholarship and it won't be for their grades no matter what policies and rules are in place, so they fall back on sports to provide scholarships. The policy should continue as is and will aid and promote college education for and more to young student athletes in our school.

As for extra circular activities they are only on occasion will look good on a college application and some may help to further educate students a fun, entertaining way that will hold their attentions in a place outside of school. Therefore it is also a plus to the promotion of out of school learning. Please take my opinion to heart and see the conflict at hand from our, the student body's, view point.

Sincerely,

"No, i dont think we should have driveless cars that is a hazoired sitiouions.

Because in that type of thing the driver is not in controle of what so ever the driver has no purpose to be there at all and it can be a very dangerous on there part because like instead of the person controling the car that is his life in his own hands

But say the car is in controle he/she will be putting there life in a computers chip they have to be 100% sure with that in order for it to be ok but i bet 50% of the people won't even care about there own life why you say.

because they will be to busy enjoying there new drivless car what if perhapes the car has a milefuntion on the passenger and it hits a person say kills that person what would you blame that on the person or the car the peron had nothing to do with it why because he/she was to depended on their new drive less car.

You also have to think about the legal lieablitiy with this new found car you have to have a sertain amount of mature level to drive a regular car but a drivless car thats crazy you can fall asleep at the wheel kill sombody and say it was not your fault you can blame it on the people that make these cars thats noun sence what would that .

Family think they will still press charges on you and the people that make because its they fault for the milefunction but yours fault fo not paying attention. It would be madness for all plus what human skills would be requird for this to get purchesed if not any you telling me you would fell 100% comfterable with.

A baby in the front seat of a car not me i surely will not feel safe aswell as comfterable

In concluesion no i think that driveless cars are hazirodes sitiuions.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"The ""technolgy to read students"" is a great idea because, it could help many students and teachers know when it is time to stop and when it is time to begin. Some students can't focus has long has other students can.

""Technology to read students"" knows when a student is bored. This is great because, if a student is bored during a lesson then you know the lesson isn't helping them. It will also help teacher out to pick a diffrent assignment or move on to something else. If the assignments are boring it looks bad on students and also the teacher, because nobody is getting work done. So technoly that reads students would help out big time.

If technology knows when you are mad, or frustrated the computer would know that and the computer would alert the teacher then, the teacher would know you were probably frustrated because you were struggling. Say a student was scared or nervous to ask the teacher for help, the teacher would get the alert from the computer saying the student is frustrated.

Last, technology will tell you if the student is happy. This will help because, if students are happy with an assignment that means they are getting it and they know what they're doing. The teacher will get an alert saying students are haptpy then that means they are enjoying the assignment or lesson. If everyone is happy it looks good on students and teachers.

""Technology reads students"" is a great idea because, it would help so many people out in school. It would lead to better test scores. More money for teachers. If technology coud read students, it would be a great source!         ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The effects of greenhouse gas emission began to take their toll on the earth's atmosphere simply by its own natural output. As time has gone on though, and humans and their ways of transportation have evolved, greenhouse gas emission is becoming more of a problem. Automobiles, mainly cars, play a huge role in the production of nasty fumes and gases that become trapped in the atmosphere. For example, in Europe passenger cars make up twelve percent of total greenhouse gas emission, and in heavily congested areas such as the United States-it can skyrocket up to fifty percent!

Some nations/countries are beginning to take a new approach to battle the ""War of Greenhouse Gases"". As studies have shown that national driving levels and the amount of people purchasing cars and earning their licenses are dropping after their peak in 2005, people are more and more willing to put down the car keys and put on their running shoes. One of these places in particular is the city of Vauban and is located in Germany. It is a middle-class to upper class community and its citizens can be considered pioneers of suburbia. Vauban does not permit driving in it's limits, besides the main thoroughfare, and a few side streets. Car owners buy a space for their car for $40,000 alongside a home.

While some might argue about the practicality of not driving your car if you have one, it's shown to be extremely beneficial not only for the environment, but for people as well. When you go outside, whether you're headed somewhere or just on a casual stroll, you may reach Nirvana as you enjoy the true sounds of nature. In places where cars are permitted to drive, you might hear the sound of birds chirping outside your window, or the calm rustle of leaves rustling in the wind, but the rumbles, roars, and honks of a car are not far behind. In areas such as Vauban, the beautiful sounds of the world won't be drowned out by a greasy hunk of steel.

Besides feeling at peace, a life without a car is a healthier life! Now, when you want to go somewhere, you must rely on your own two feet. Those two feet, bicycle, skateboard, etc. will be all you need to get where you're going! Unlike many places though, everything is within walking distance for convenience and to encourage you to take these steps. Notice the physical and emotional changes in yourself once in a place with no cars-you'll feel more relaxed, less rushed, and your body will thank you.            ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Screaming and the sounds of objects shattering is what Generic_Name hears on a daily basis in her house. Usually its because of a small disagreement between her parents and gradually gets more intense but recently its been because of her. Generic_Name and Generic_Name are getting a divorce and have recently been arguing about who was going to keep Generic_Name because nobody wanted the responsibility. Since Generic_Name is 13 years old, she has the option of either staying with one of her parents or being put up for adoption. She wakes up one morning for school, trying not to make a sound because she doesnt want her parents waking up and starting her day of with screaming. When she manages to get out the house she puts a fake smile on and carries on her day. Throughout it, she asks her best friend, who was the only one who new about the situation, for her opinion on it. Generic_Name gives her thoughts but doesnt seem to care much about it. Generic_Name doesnt bother asking anybody else. Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice can make a better choice because someone might have asked for the same advice before, there might be someone with more knowledge about it, and there is less stress on yourself on making a decision all on your own.

One reason you should ask for for multiple advice is because someone might have asked for the same advice before. For instance, Generic_Name is going through a breakup and she doesnt know what to do. She asks multiple people for their advice and a couple of them tell her they have been through the same thing then they give her their opinion on what they have done in the past. Since she asked more than one person for advice, she got results. Another example, when I was getting a pet for my birthday I had the choice of either getting a dog or a cat. I asked all my friends for their opinion about it and they all gave me the pro's and con's about each one since most of them had the same situation happen to them before. I ended up getting a cat because I was told it would be less expensive, less work to care for it, but be more fun to have. Since I got many opinions on my advice, I made the best decision and got better results.

Secondly, you should ask for multiple opinions for advice because there might be someone with more knowledge about it. For instance, Generic_Name is in an abusive relationship and her boyfriend cannot handle his anger so he takes it out on her and whenever she goes to work she always has to wear pants and a long sleeved shirt to hide her scars and bruises. She finally tells her co-workers about her situation, asks for their opinions and all of them tell her it isn't healthy to be in that relationship. She broke up with him and things started getting better from then on. Because she asked so many people about it and they seemed to know much more than she did, her life was much better and safer. Another example, when Generic_Name was asking a question on a math problem she asked one person for help and they gave her an answer but when she asked the teacher about it, she got the question wrong. She then on started asking multiple people for answers on her math homework and most of them would give her the right answers. Since other people had better knowledge than her, she got her math homework answers correct.

Lastly, you should ask multiple people for their advice because it would be less stress on yourself for making a choice on your own. For instance, Generic_Name has been very depressed lately and is deciding if she should run away. She tells her friends at school and they give all their attention on her and tell her that it isnt right so she should stay. It helps Generic_Name a lot since she is not the only with the weight of that decision and she decides to stay because she trusts her friends. Eventually things turn around for her and she is back to her normal, happy self. Since she didnt have all that weight of her decision all to herself, she didnt feel as stressed. Another example, when Generic_Name's parents were getting a divorce she had to decide whether to live with her mom or dad. Its stressful enough that she has to choose between two people she loves. She asks multiple friends and some of her counselors about what she should do and each one of them help her out. Since she is getting help from so many people she feels less stressed about her decision making. Getting multiple opinions on something could make decision making less stressful.

Generic_Name comes home one one day after school and as soon as she walks in she sees books being thrown at her dad from her mom. Generic_Name quickly shuts the door, grabs her bike and heads to the mall. She sees her friend group at the mall and joins in. They're exited to see her and they hang out. Generic_Name is debating whether to tell her friends about whats happening at her house. She finally gathers up the courage and asks her friends about it. They seem shocked at first because they didnt know about it, other than Generic_Name, but they start telling her about their opinions on it. One of her friends went through something similar and tell Generic_Name what she did and how it will have a better outcome. all her friends say that she should choose to be with another family because it will have a better outcome. Generic_Name feels less stressed about the situation since shes not the only one having to choose a choice all by herself and she trusts them about it because they have more knowledge about it. After spending her whole afternoon at the mall, she rides her bike home. She enters her house and still sees her parents arguing. She takes a deep breath and interrupts them. She tells them about her decision. 3 years later Generic_Name is living in a house that never has anybody arguing and has two new parents that love her. Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice can make a better choice because someone might have asked for the same advice before, there might be someone with more knowledge about it, and there is less stress on yourself on making a decision all on your own.",0,persuade_corpus,3

For one, if you are an animal lover you get a chance to help the animals on the cattle boat. As it says in the text, ""On his second trip, Luke seved as a night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour.""

The second reason is that even though you are serving around the world you still get to go sight seeing. In paragraph five it says, "" Luke also toured an exavated castle in Crete and maveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.""

The third reason is that you get to be of sevice around the world to help countries after World War II. In the story it says, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, forty-four nations joined together to form UNRRA (The United Stations Relief and Rehabilitation Administation).""

"Many people believe that this face on Mars was made by an Ancient Alian Race that once lived on Mars. This Face was discivered 25 Years ago on a space Expedition. Most NASA scientisis believe that this Face on Mars is a natural land form but, some believe that it is not natural and was formed by Alians. Many Scientists also think against the thought of the formation on Mars being made by an ancient civilization that lived on Mars. Scientists that are against the theory of the face being formed by Alians argue that there are formations on Earth that are also formed how the one on Mars was and that this is natural.

Many Scientisis believe that this is a natural landform because it is like some of the other landforms in the Western United States like the Butte in the Snake River Plain of Ohio. Scientists believe that both of these landforms were created by lava domes because the two formations are around the exact same height and are therefore believed to be created in the same and natural way.

Scientisis have been researching the Face on Mars for years abd have come up with a reasonal explination for why the Face on Mars was not created by Alians and is a natural land formation that is created the same way as some formations in the Western United States.

"Sure, I can do that! Here's my essay:

Hey there,

For my career research project, I decided to look into the field of graphic design. I've always been interested in art and technology, and I think this career combines both of those things in a really cool way. Plus, I've seen some of the amazing things that graphic designers can create, like logos, posters, and websites, and I want to be able to do that too!

So, I started doing some research to see what skills and interests I have that align with this career. I found out that I'm pretty good at drawing and painting, and I'm also good at using computers and software to create digital art. I also like to think creatively and come up with new ideas, which is important for graphic design.

To learn more about the career, I talked to some people who are already in the field. They told me that graphic designers need to have a good eye for detail and a good sense of color and composition. They also need to be able to work well with clients and communicate their ideas effectively. I was surprised to learn that it's not just about being able to draw pretty pictures – it's also about being able to solve problems and come up with creative solutions.

Next, I made a list of the courses I can take to prepare for this career. I'm thinking of taking some art classes to improve my drawing and painting skills, as well as some computer classes to learn more about software and design principles. I'm also considering taking a course in graphic design specifically, to learn more about the industry and what's expected of graphic designers.

Overall, I think graphic design is a really cool career that combines my interests in art and technology. I'm excited to continue learning more about it and see where it takes me!

Why I Chose This Career:

I chose graphic design as my career because I'm interested in both art and technology, and I think this career combines both of those things in a really cool way. I also like the idea of being able to create something from scratch and see it come to life in a final product. Plus, I think it would be fun to work with clients and help them come up with cre",1,llama2_chat,1
"As author says Venus is dangerous to send humans to study the planet, the author does state we should still try and don't let the challenges stop us from doing so. the author states Astromnomers believe Venus was probably covered largely by oceans and could've support various type of lives.

Astronomers are facinated by Venus beacause the believe ""it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" meaning a similar discussion about Mars. They believe that Venus, long ago, ""was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" demostration it could be an interesting visit to Venus and if the statements or beliefs are true, Sciencetist might find an answer why Venus doesn't support life or the bodies of oceans dissapear if it did have those features in the first place.

""Venus still has some features that analogous to those on Earth"" meaning there could've been a possibility about life on Venus but also was discover that ""the planet has a surface of rocky sidiment and inclused familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" demostrating interesting theories people can make why those familiar features are in Venus and how they were created if no life existed there.

Finally, Venus ""can be our nearest option for a planetary visit,"" for example: and ""end of the world"" scenario. People could travel to Venus to start a new life there, if researchers make an innovation to make it safe to land in Venus and probaly restore life in the planet if it did long ago.

"Many schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Usually these projects are designed by the teacher to either help review past information or to introduce new information to the student. Most of the time these projects are not completed by many students. Summer projects should be designed by students because students who have already taken the class understand the basic knowledge to be successful in the class, students understand what other students will and will not do, and students know what the teacher expects of you.

Students who have already taken the class understand the basic knowledge to be successful in the class. For example Generic_Name, who has already taken Prerequisite Calculus the past year, knows exactly what they learned throughout the year and what basic knowledge she would have liked to know before she began the class. She could make a detailed assignment with all the information needed to be fully prepared for the class while the teacher can only speculate what the students know or dont know. With this information students will come better prepared to the first day of class because they already know what to expect and have viewed some of the information in the, student made, summer project. Another example of students understanding the basic knowledge to be successful in the class is when they all fail the test based on the summer project including, the ones who completed the project. Many of the students believe that the project did not help them fully grasp the concepts presented in it. With their new found knowledge of what is expected to be known on the test they can now help other students by giving them a summer project that will help them understand the concepts fully. This will keep students from having that first test be a failure and have to work the whole entire quarter to bring it up. Also with this information from former students they will be better prepared for the more advanced topics, now that they know the basics. Even if the teacher is able to make a summer project that helps the students understand the basics, they still don't understand what many students will and will not do.

Throughout the summer many students have multiple things to do including sports, work, and hanging out with friends that they have not seen in a while. Students understand this and realize what another student will and will not do. For example Generic_Name, who has recently taken AP Physics, was unable to finish his summer project because he does swimming, basketball, and soccer over the summer. He did not do the assignment because it required him to sit down for multiple hours at a time, that he did not have, if he wanted to fully understand the topics it was going over. Generic_Name and many other students would be more likely to complete the project if they were able to make the project have multiple small sections that can be completed in a half hour instead of 5 hours. This will allow the students time between activities to complete the project, making it more manageable. Many teachers do not understand the limited amount of time some students have over the summer for school work. Another example of students understanding what other students will and will not do is Generic_Name who has a very short attention span, and was unable to finish the 50 page summer project. Many students believe that if they were to shorten the project students would be able to complete it and have better results on it. With this shortened project students will be encouraged to complete it, knowing that it will not consume all of their free time over the summer. They will also show more work and have more quality work because they have less to do. This will allow them to understand the topics more and be more successful in the class. Even if the teacher was able to make a project that all students were willing to do, former students know what the teacher expects of his/her students.

Students who have already taken the class know exactly what the teacher expects from a student in order to have an A or a B in the class. For example Generic_Name, who is taking Prerequisite Chemistry, has failed almost every test and quiz in the class, but fully understands the concepts being taught. Soon he realizes that the teacher expects every bit of work to be shown for every single problem. This includes showing the formula before you even start your work. Knowing this a student would be able to inform another student of this in the summer project. This would allow the students to prepare to show all their work on the tests and quizzes by practicing on the summer project. Many teachers try to make an example on the first quiz by taking points off for students not showing all their work. With the student made project other students would be prepared for this and not fail by forgetting to show all their work. Another example of a student knowing what the teacher expects is when the teacher makes all the work optional including the summer project but, still expects you to know the information. In the summer packet students will be able to inform other students of what information is important to know going into that first week of school. This will allow the students who complete the assignment to be prepared for the school year. Even if the teacher helps the students by telling them the more important information on the packet students who have already taken the class know the basic knowledge needed to pass the class and know what student are willing to do.

In conclusion summer projects should be designed by students because students who have already taken the class know what the teacher is looking for in the students, and know the information needed to pass the class with an A. Also students understand that many students have very limited time to complete a huge assignment over the summer; therefore, they will account for that while creating the project. ",0,persuade_corpus,0

"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that introducing a new menu for the cafeteria is a great idea. However, it is important to consider the pros and cons of this change, especially when it comes to the impact on students with existing dietary requirements and the potential effects on students with longer attendance at the school.

On the one hand, introducing a new menu can bring a fresh and exciting change to the cafeteria experience. It can also provide more options for students who may have dietary restrictions or preferences. For example, if the new menu includes more vegetarian or vegan options, it can cater to students who follow these diets. Additionally, if the menu includes more healthy options, it can encourage students to make better food choices.

On the other hand, introducing a new menu can also have negative consequences. For students with existing dietary requirements, a new menu may mean that their preferred options are no longer available. This can be frustrating and disappointing, especially if they have been attending the school for a long time. Additionally, if the new menu includes unfamiliar items, it may take some time for students to adjust to the new options.

Furthermore, introducing a new menu can also have an impact on students with longer attendance at the school. These students may have become accustomed to the existing menu and may be resistant to change. They may also feel that their preferences and dietary requirements are being ignored.

In conclusion, while introducing a new menu for the cafeteria can bring many benefits, it is important to consider the potential consequences. It is important to ensure that the new menu includes options for students with existing dietary requirements and that it does not negatively impact students with longer attendance at the school. Ultimately, the goal should be to provide a welcoming and inclusive cafeteria experience for all students.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0

In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of outdoor activities, compare them to playing video games, examine the risks and safety concerns associated with certain outdoor activities, analyze the different types of parks, and detail the fun and health benefits of playing sports outdoors.

Researching outdoor activities has shown me that there are countless options to choose from, such as hiking, camping, swimming, and biking. These activities not only provide physical exercise but also allow individuals to connect with nature and enjoy the great outdoors. Being in nature has been shown to reduce stress levels, improve mood, and boost creativity. Additionally, outdoor activities can be a great way to spend time with family and friends, fostering social connections and building relationships.

Compared to playing video games, outdoor activities offer a more diverse range of benefits. While video games can provide entertainment and social interaction, they often involve sedentary behavior, which can lead to a lack of physical activity and obesity. Outdoor activities, on the other hand, provide a more dynamic and engaging way to stay active, while also offering a chance to explore and experience the natural world.

However, it is important to acknowledge the risks and safety concerns associated with certain outdoor activities, such as rock climbing, hunting, and skydiving. These activities can be dangerous if proper safety measures are not taken, and it is essential to receive proper training and equipment to minimize the risks. It is crucial to be aware of the potential dangers and take necessary precautions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.

Another aspect of outdoor activities is the variety of parks and recreational areas available. These parks offer a range of activities, such as hiking trails, playgrounds, and sports fields, providing something for everyone to enjoy. Analyzing the different types of parks has shown me that they can be an excellent way to promote physical activity, social interaction, and environmental conservation.

Playing sports outdoors is another way to enjoy the benefits of outdoor activities. Sports such",1,llama2_chat,2
"Students now can take classes from their houses. Schools are offering students the possibility to take classes online from their houses, I think is a excellent idea because sometimes students dont have the possibility on getting a ride to get to school, or it makes it easier for students that have to stay home for personal reasons, or even if you want to take a class during the summer to get more credits and get to graduate earlier.

Sometimes students do not have the possibility on getting rides to school and the county do not offer them a bus transportation system that can take them to school, for example in my country Costa Rica there is not a free transportation system to get to school and the only transportation system is the public one and you will have to pay for it, its an excellent idea from the schools to have this kind of classes that you can take from your own house.

Some students have reasons that make them stay home, such as girls being pregnant, students taking care of their parents that need people to take care of them because they are sick or have any disability and they can not stay home alone, in those cases students can finish their school courses at home and take care of their loved ones at the same time.

Some students just do it to finish high school earlier, they have the opportunity on taking classes online during the summer and be able to get less classes on their senior year or just graduate earlier if they taking the standard diploma, that is a smart thing to do if you are planing on go to college and finish your carrier on a young age, and start working at young age too.

On my opinion I think that having that opportunity is a good thing and a bad thing because going to school is the best decision that you can make on your life, you get to make friends and get to know a lot of people during all the time you spend at school, but not everyone have that opportunity, thats why this opportunity that the school is giving you is unique and can help you a lot, the only thing you need is a computer or a electronic device that can get access to the internet.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students at school probably to not want to Attend in a community service group or club. Community service is not really a job for students. It is more of a job for people in jail. Most students also attend in sports like football, soccer, baseball/softball and basketball. They would probably be practicing for a big game coming up or just try to get better because maybe that's what they want to be when they get older is a famous basketball player, soccer player, football player, Bike Rider, Skateboarder, Baseball/softball player for their job or life. Students might have things to do like studding. If people did not litter this would be so much easier so students and people in jail didn't have to clean up after them. Picking up trash off the side of the road is not a students job. That could also take away time of their education. Taking away their education would not be a good idea if someone in that group wants to be able to go to college or a university. Not everyone will but a lot of people want to do something with their life or help people like help people out in nursing homes and give them company. Theirs a lot you could help people with and it can help save our wold as well. yes , Picking up trash can save our would but that is only if they want to. If you make a Community Service and people join it then that would work. Most do like to help their cities/towns but a lot of people are interested in their education and what they are going to do with their lives. A lot people do not plan on working by picking up trash.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Imagine if someone decided school is now nine or ten ours long instead of the traditional seven hours, because that is what it sounded like to the students that attend my school when our principle announced all students must participate in an extracurricular activity. I disagree with making it mandatory that all students must participate in an activity after school. Students in low income families often do not have the required finances nor time it takes to participate, additionally the stress can easily overload students of all grade levels.

Many low income families can't meet the requirements for an extracurricular activity. Almost all activities require parents to buy materials such as uniforms or supplies that can quickly add up to hundreds of dollars. Even if the school offered to pay for the requirements, you would be taking away money from more academic uses such as field trips or classroom supplies. A doctors appointment alone costs families an obnoxious amount of money but when a student has to receive an updated physical and the needed vaccines annually before they can participate in any physical activity it can quickly become an unrealistic goal. Accidents always happen and if a student was to get injured how would a lower class family be able to pay for the necessary treatment? Not getting immediate medical attention for broken bones or sprained ankles can leave people in severe pain for the rest of their lives, this leaves a huge liability for the school. Parents could easily sue the school for the medical treatment, once again that is money that could be going towards academic advancements. Transportation is another thing many students do not have access to. In a home where parents work low income jobs they often can't take time off of work to pick up their child from school, because of this many students would be forced to ride a bike or walk home which can become a safety hazard.

Older students often work at after school jobs and must complete several chores at home, this can make an extracurricular impossible to attend. Trying to balance school and a job is already hard to balance but when you add an extra activity on top of that leaves you with no time for a personal life. Free time is usually spent with family and friends, and when you take away that free time relationships can be strained or ruined. Not only does this directly affect the students but it can also hurt an entire family. I often have to babysit my younger siblings so they would have no where to stay while I was gone.

Stress is a growing problem for students at my school, including myself. Parents often pressure their kids into making straight A's and achieving that is already a stressful goal but when you add an after school activity it can severely damage a students mental health. Most teachers assign homework and balancing that alone is difficult but after requiring an extracurricular leaves very little time for the additional work. School is around seven hours long meaning children as young as five years old are required to sit at a desk for seven hours each day, five days a week. When school is over students want to be able to go home and relax, not participate in another two hour activity. This can leave them exhausted which affects their overall mental and physical health.

In conclusion, I disagree with making it mandatory that all students must participate in an activity after school. Students in low income families often do not have the required finances nor time it takes to participate, additionally the stress can easily overload students of all grade levels. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The author presents a strong argument suggesting a worthy pursuit to study Venus depsite dangerous endeavors, however, his statments regauarding un-reliability on current technology, the necessary actions to conduct research, and numerous failed attempts to reach Venus greatly outweigh the good outcomes of this mission. Venus is considered the planet that is most similar to Earth. The passage explained that scientist speculate if there was once life on Venus considering it incredible geographical and size similarities to earth. Although further research could test their theories, Venus has very extreme weather conditions harmul to man and other objects. A closer look and gathering of evidence is expected to make this mission a success. However, modern day technology is barely able to keep up efficiently by just the use of humans. These issues are far too risky to consider pursuing.

Venus has features such as mountains, craters, and even valleys that are also seen on Earth. According to the article, its atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide with temperatures averging 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth with can crush nearly anything that tries to reach its surface and even liquefy metals. The second paragraph discussed how spacecrafts in the past barely lasted a few hours and since there hasn't been a spacecraft sent there in more than three decades. This evidence shows that despite the success of reaching Venus, we are not even close to even slowly progressing and fixing smaller issues with spacecrafts traveling there and back to Earth. By not providing evidence of some sort of pregression or steps closer to considering sending humans to Venus, the author weakens his arguments over the better outcomes of conducting research.

Conducting research requires numerous forms of evidence, samples, test, etc. In paragraph 5, the author makes suggestions of creating a spacecraft to sustain temperatures of at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit and levitating thirty-plus miles over the surface to observe the planet. Although this may be the most safest and efficient approach, he even stated that it would require getting ""up close and personal"" to collect samples. The whole idea is to reach Venus and collect data to compare to Earth and Venus' previous history. Without being able to collect samples, the author weakens his argument to study Venus despite the dangers it presents.

Lastly, modern day technology is known for its speed and cinvenience to access information. In paragraph 7, the author discussed how electronics we simplified to last at least three weeks in simulating conditions to Venus. He explained, ""modern computers...tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physicakl conditions."" He supported this claim by informing readers that older technology, mechanical computers, have been re-evaluated and seem to have better calculations but involve levers and such. This weakens his argument because it would mean that this mission wouldn'tt be helpful if the right technology can't be utilized to help calculate and evalutate information.

All in all, the author makes very good claims as to why NASA should continue to pursue further research on Venus. It would help determine if there was previous life, if it once operated as successful as earth, and if Earth could potentially be headed in the same direction. However, the extreme weather conditions, actions necessary for research, and un-cooperative technology make this pursuit seem far less worth it considering how danger it is for humans and even the spacecrafts sent to examine the planet. Ultimately, the project can be deemed as impossible if facts given in the article remain the same.   ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Doing something in order to accomplish one's goals is infinitely better than doing nothing. Taking action, however small, gives us the opportunity to grow, learn, and become more capable of tackling more significant challenges. By strategizing, we can create a step-by-step plan designed to make our dreams a reality--stakes become more manageable and our options become clearer. 

Opportunities, both tangible and intangible, become available from taking some steps towards achieving our desired end goal. These opportunities serve to further our ambitions by exposing us to new knowledge and networks that couldn't be gained otherwise. By doing something, we put our best foot forward and showcase our level of commitment to those around us, possibly leading to new and exciting opportunities not available if we simply stayed still.

Ultimately, doing something also aids our decision-making process. We become clear on what we want and the steps needed to get there. Over analyzing different situations can be overwhelming and paralyzing, but by taking action we can move forward and gain momentum we can carry with us. All in all, doing something is far better than doing nothing, as it allows us to grow and capitalize on chances to further our ambitions and build a successful future.",1,chat_gpt_moth,3
"Dear Principal ,

I am against Community Service and tutoring elementary kids . Here are my reasons why . Community Service does take away time from us students need . For example some students may or may not go home right away . They probably have sport to go to , be with friends , tutoring , or detention . We don't have time for Community Service . All of us work too hard to be needing to do Community Service . By the time we arrive home it'll be around 6 sometimes maybe even 7 . We'll still need to eat , do homework , shower , chores , and then watch a little bit of television . At the end of day were tired and stressed out from school . Why do we need Community Service added to our list of stress ? It's a waste of time and energy . I agree the environment needs to get clean . That ain't our job though ! Get somebody else . Tutoring elementary students is helpful and may feel good after you've tutored . I personally wouldn't want to tutor some students may feel that way too . What if were the reason they may have failed a test ?

I would want a more experienced person to be teaching my kids not some Junior High or High school student . We don't know as much as we think . That's why teachers should do their job and what their getting paid for and teach the students right so us students don't be needing to tutor other students .

"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Um, so, like, I tried to write this essay about how I want to improve myself and stuff. I know I'm not the best writer or anything, but I tried my best. I think. 

So, like, I know I'm not the most confident person in the world, and I want to work on that. I want to be more outgoing and stuff, you know? Like, I want to make new friends and stuff. So, I've been trying to put myself out there more, like, talking to people and stuff. It's not easy, but I'm getting better at it. I also want to improve my writing skills, so I've been writing more and stuff. It's not as easy as it looks, but I'm trying my best.

I think if I can just keep working on myself and stuff, it'll help me in the long run. Like, I'll be more confident and stuff, and I'll be able to do more things. I want to be able to write better and stuff, and I want to be able to talk to people without being super nervous. It's like, I want to be able to be myself and stuff, you know?

But, like, there are challenges too. Sometimes it's hard to keep motivated and stuff, especially when things get tough. Like, when I'm writing and I'm like, ""Ugh, this is so hard,"" it's easy to get discouraged and stuff. But I'm trying to stay positive and stuff, and keep pushing through. I know it'll be worth it in the end.

So, yeah, that's pretty much it. That's what I'm trying to do to improve myself, and how I think it'll help me in the long run.  I hope it makes sense and stuff.",1,llama2_chat,3
"Is the Face on Mars real? In my opinion the Face on Mars is real. Here are my reasons why.

The Face on Mars is real because it can be a natural landform on Mars just like we have natural landforms on Earth. Now may I ask a question? How can ailens make a face on Mars? In the picture provided, it seems the face pops out and there is no evidence that a creature could have made a face with no flaws. In the article, a webiste states "" thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.""

I understand that people may have a theory about the face, but hence the word theory. Theory is just a guess with evidence supporting the claim, but is there enough evidence to support the Face? People from NASA have studied the Face since it first appeared in 1976. Since then, people have found claims and have had facts about the face proving it is just a natural landscape.

How did the face appear? There can be many reasons on how the face appeared on Mars. There could have been a storm on Mars that caused the ground to move upright and form the Face. The face could have been on Mars since Mars was created and NASA just never payed enough attention until 1976. I do not believe an ailen created the Face on mars.

Is the face on Mars real? Keep that question in your head. I believe this essay has provided enough evidence proving the Fac on Mars is just a natural landform. That's just my opinion. What's your opinion?   ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"When you are looking up at the stars and planets at night, do you ever wander what is going on up there. Well what if I said that there was a chance to go visit the planet Venus. Yes, there is many dangers on Venus, but there is so much to explore too; like how Venus is the most like Earth when it comes to shape and size, the gases and temperture, and the curious of how Venus looks like now.

When you think of Venus, what do you think of? Do you think of the heat or the size? Well, when scienetist think of Venus they ""[often] referred to as Earth's ""twin"", Venus is the cloese planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closet in distance too"". So, becasue of how close it looks in shape and size, you have to have though in your mind of, what else does it have in common.

When you think of dangerous gases and temperture, what this the things that you think of? Do you think of hot summer day or the gases in the air? Well, on Venus ""[a] thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuris acid in Venus's atmoshpere. In the planet's surface, tempertures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheris pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our own planet"". Eventhough, it could be life theathing, there are scientist that want to do test and collect gases and ect to do studies. They want to do studies because they want to learn some much more about Venus.

When you think of how Venus looks like, do you think of craters and the sign of no life? Well, you be somewhat correct because it has a rocky surface, and it looks like valleys, mountain and craters. Although ""[long] ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". Since, there was a possible that there was life forms and etc, scientist want to see if there was some kind of life living up there, but then got exstinted or somethings else happened to them.

So, to rap this all up, scientist know the danger of explore Venus, but sometime you have to do thing that are danger to learn new things. People alway talk about wanting to explore different planets, but they never do it. Yes, there are going to be opsolcules in the way, and there are going to be dangerous things we have do to go there, but it will be worth it in end. Nevertheless, there was forms of life on Venus in the past, why not have life on Venus again.       ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Abolishing the Electoral College may be the best choice because the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the elecetoral college. Also at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.

If a tie occurs the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representating 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million voters. Because of many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, The House's selection can hardly reflect the will of the people. For exapmple a tie would have occured in 1976 if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in Hawaii had voted the other way.

The electoral college can be unfair to voters because the winner-take-all syntem in each state, candidates fon't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning. For example during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

The elctoral college can have many good things but it still is not good enough for us to keep it. If the winner-tak-all systm didn't exist candidates would spend time in states even if they know they have no chance of winning, because they will not lose anything or maybe have at least a liitle chance of winning.

"Some may argue that teacher-design projects are the best way for students to continues to learn during their break, but summer projects should be student-designed because of these three reasons: it allows the students creativity to flow through their projects, when allowed to chose what they want to do, students work better on projects; because learning should be fun, students tend to enjoy the work they're given when allowed to do it their own way.

As children, our imagination tends to run wild, hence the crazy colorful drawings we bring home from kindergarten, or the weird concoctions we put together in our make believe kitchen; But as we get older we tend to lose that, weather it may be through age or other things, our imagination isn't as it was when we were younger. When given free will to do whatever we want on a project, students get to tap into that wild imagination we have locked away somewhere in our brain, a creativity that we don't get to use as often as we could. some of this is due to having teachers decide on what or how we should do our work. At times we are given a sheet of paper that tells us how and what our project should look like; because of this our creativity has no space in the box that we are forced to fit into. If given a chance to choose, more often than not, not only teachers, but our peers and our parents get to see what its kind of like inside our brains. Through our creativity you can learn what the person behind the creativity is like.

When a student is given free will over a task given, it is a high probability that they will do their best to make the project amazing. In many cases student do better on any sort of assignment when given the chance to choose how they want to complete said assignment. One of the best feeling a student has is having a peace of mind knowing that they turned in an project that they did their best and worked hard on, and knowing that their hard work payed off. Through this, students learn to do their best in anything that they do, no matter it being school work or work outside of school. My Dad would always say ""Your school is like your second home, what you learn at home is what you will apply and use in the real world."" Giving the chance to students, if the summer projects were to be student-designed, students will work better and harder on it than if they were teacher-designed.

As I stated previously, learning should be fun. it is human nature to want and to enjoy presenting a project that we've worked extra hard on to our peers and our teachers. Being able to do what we want when it come to projects is enjoyable for the students and the teacher. People work better when they enjoy the task given to them. Using our creativity on a certain subject makes the learning experience enjoyable. The process in which we go through creating projects should be enjoyable. From the planing to the reaserch to assembling the the project, every step it takes can be a fun learning experience, if given the chance.

As we grow up we get lesser chances of using our creativity. Having teacher-designed projects, most of the time, hinders our creativity from coming through our work. Student-designed projects will give the student a chance to show their creativity, and through this they will work better on their project, which will then make it a fun learning experience not only for them but for their peers and even their teachers.        ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"PHONES & Driving

Driving with a cell phone has its pros and cons but it really depends on the driver if driving with a phones is a bad thing. Some people use their cell phone for navigation that could help them get around in an unfamiliar area. The cons of it is that some people may be paying too much attention to their phone and not to the road. Being on your phone could be helpful or dangerous.

The reason it could be help full is that it would be easier to call for roadside assistances. If I were to have a break down I could call to have my car towed away and have a ride home. I also could use it to call for someone else who need roadside assistance and may not have access to it. It can also be used for traffic reports if there's heavy traffic or there's been a wreck and you can call for help.

The reason driving with a phone would be bad is that you could easily be distracted by it and can get in a wreck or cause one. Being on the phone with someone may cause you not to hear someone honking at you. Teens should not be able to have their phones in hand while driving since they use their phone the most.

If I were to make laws I would pass a law saying that people under the age of 21 shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving. I would make it cause usually the ones under 21 are the main one son social media the most and could even get distracted by a simple notification.           ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"decisions. Finally, discuss the importance of seeking professional help when necessary and how it can positively impact a person’s behavior.

External life events can have a significant impact on a person’s behavior. These events can range from losing a loved one to experiencing a traumatic event, and can cause a wide range of emotional and psychological reactions. For example, a person who has experienced a traumatic event may develop anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can affect their behavior in various ways.

An individual’s upbringing can also play a significant role in their behavior. The values, beliefs, and experiences of their childhood can shape their personality, beliefs, and attitudes towards life. For example, a person who grew up in a household that values hard work and perseverance may be more likely to be resilient in the face of adversity.

Behavior changes can occur as a result of various life experiences. These changes can range from minor adjustments to major shifts in a person’s behavior. For example, a person who has experienced a loss may become more cautious in their relationships or may struggle with feelings of depression or sadness.

Individuals can become aware of how their life experiences are impacting them by taking the time to reflect on their behavior and emotions. They can also seek feedback from friends, family, or a therapist to gain a better understanding of their behavior and how it may be affected by their life experiences.

People can use the hardships of life to become stronger by developing resilience and coping skills. Resilience is the ability to bounce back from adversity, while coping skills are strategies for managing stress and dealing with difficult situations. For example, a person who has experienced a traumatic event may develop coping skills such as mindfulness or therapy to help them manage their emotions and behavior.

Taking control of one’s life and making conscious decisions can have numerous benefits. It can increase a person’s sense of agency and empowerment, which can lead to improved self-esteem and confidence. It can also help a person to achieve their goals and live a more fulfilling life.

However, it is important to seek professional help when necessary. A mental health professional can provide guidance and support in managing the emotional and psychological effects of external life events. They can also help individuals develop coping",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"In my opinion, I believe driverless cars would have a great impact on this and next generation. Everday you that someone has died or critically injured themselves driving cars. Driverless takes all of future injuries away. Self-driving cars are safer because it has more sensors related to what the passage stated in paragraph 5.

You won't necessarily be driving but assisting the car even though the car drives on its own. That doesn't mean you may text on your phone even though your not driving, you will still need to pay attention and alerted just in case. Like, if there is a car accident, work zone, or if you are putting the vehicle into reverse, that would require human driving skills like the passage stated in paragraph 7. Car seats will vibrate if there a object behind the while reversing the car.

All in all, I believe driveless cars is a outstanding idea to infer. Its a problem solved before it occured. By 2020, like the text states"" Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves."" Its easier and safer. The future is all about making everyday burdens easier and safer.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Hey there! 

So, you know how people always say ""figure out what you want to be when you grow up""? Yeah, I'm still trying to figure that out. But, I guess it's important to have a plan, right? Like, picking a career and stuff. My counselor keeps talking about how it's good to have a career path in mind when you enter high school. She says it can open up opportunities and stuff. But, I don't know...

I mean, I'm only in 8th grade, so I gotta focus on school stuff first, you know? But, I guess it would be cool to have a plan. Like, maybe I could be an engineer or something.

My friend Sarah's mom is a lawyer, and she's like, super smart and stuff. Maybe I could be a lawyer too. But, I don't know if I'm smart enough.  And, there's so many other careers to choose from! It's like, how am I supposed to decide?!

My school doesn't really offer any career-specific programs or anything, but I heard some schools do. Like, my friend Jack's school has this thing where you can take classes in different fields and stuff. That sounds pretty cool, I guess. But, I don't know if I could handle that much extra work. 

I guess the pros of choosing a career early are that you get to start preparing and stuff. Like, you can take classes that are related to your career and get experience. And, you can start building your network and stuff. But, the cons are that you might miss out on other opportunities. Like, maybe you could've done something else if you didn't have a career plan.

I think that it should be at least a B grade average to participate in sports because when you try to get into college they will not except C average. Plus if the student really wanted to play sports they get a B average. And that would be better for us in the future when we are trying to get into college. Don't in college they look at your grade from the past years to see if you qualify for what ever college you are trying to get into.

A B grade average is not really hard to get if we pay attention and do all of our homework and assignments. And in high school the coaches for the sports teams want students to get at least a 3.5 grade average so if students get use to having a b grade average then when they get in to high school they will already know what they have to do if they want to plat sports. There are probably students who already have B grade averages so it won't make a difference to them.

If most you know that most kids have a C grade average and you want to change the policy then all the students that have below a B grade average should have to attend a after school program. There they get help with there homework and do make-up work until there grade gets up but if they don't even try to get there grade raised then they should get kicked off any activity that they do unless they get there grade up.",0,persuade_corpus,0

Sometimes his job was to check the animals every hour. Luke says that ""it was the opportunity to see or do different things. Besides helping people.""

Because students can have fun when they sports. Students can have more time to talk to they friends. Students can learn something new every day when they play sports.

Students can have fun when they play sporst, students can have fun when they play soccer, student can have fun when they play basketball, teachers can have fun helping the students to play sports.

Students can have more time to talk to their friends, they can talk about projects at home or projects at school, they can talk about what sports they like to ple at home and at school, they can talk about what videogame they like and they can talk about what they do in their free time.

Students can learn something new everiday when they play sports, students can learn how to play soccer, they can learn the basic rules for soccer , they can learn how to move more fast in a soccer game.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Alien made of naturally made?

The so called ""Face on Mars"" is not a face made from aliens.

The Face is just a rock formation with shadows on it.

There is no reason to believe that the Face is make by aliens.

The ""Face on Mars"" is just a Martian mesa.

In the text is states that ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, ony this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

That states that they just figured that it was a mesa at the time being.

On April 5, 1998 they truly found out that it was just a rock formation.

The information in the text states ""and so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

Not everyone was satisfied though. ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet.

The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.

Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.""

The people were still thinking that there were aliens that made the Face.

The mission controllers prepared to look again.

""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless sumer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin.

""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum rsolution.""

Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the vest 1976 Viking photo.""

They found that the picture was actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa.

Therefore, the ""Face on Mars"" is just another rock figure with shadows.

They have solved the mystery of wether the Face is alien made or naturally made.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Our principal has decided that all of us students must take at least one extracurricular activity. While other students may disagree with this rule I strongly agree with this new decision. This new rule can help students later on with life skills or just finding their passion. The new rule can also help the school with task such as making the yearbook and making sales.

My first reason I agree with this decision is that students can use the skills from their classes later on. If you take a language class it can help with communication to other people that dont speak English. If you want to work on computers when you get older taking a computer class can help. Using skills from the classes you take can help later for jobs when you are no longer in school.

My second reason I agree with this decision is that taking these extracurricular classes can help a student discover a new hobby of theirs. At first you may not like your new extracurricular class but later on the class may become fun to do and maybe even your favorite class. I know this because I used to hate programming in computer class but now I find it very fun to do!

My third and final reason I agree with this decision is that it can help the school. If the school doesn't have a yearbook team the teachers have to make it together and that can take forever. With a team of yearbook students they can interview people for quotes, surveys for the yearbook, and make it look better overall. Another activity is sports and with sports you can do sales and make extra money for the school by selling tickets for games and food. Without a school sports team some fund raising money would be lost for things the school needs like new equipment or supplies for students.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"As a student growing up I've always wondered what it would be like if I could make my own summer project; instead of my teachers always making them. When it comes to summer projects, many people dispute whether or not, should students design said projects or should the teachers. If students designed their own summer projects they'd only pick what they're good at. They wouldn't pick what they struggle with, like a teacher would, so you can better yourself for the next level.

Me personally, I would say summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers pick what you need to work on to improve yourself, they actually know the curriculum and what you need to know for the following year, and they give you the work to help you; not to hurt you.

See, teachers actually know the curriculum and what they're teaching; so when they assign you these summer projects they're just trying to prepare you for the next step. When they give you all this extra work, or at least what seems like extra work, they are just doing it to prepare you for what comes next. Teachers just want to see you do better and use what you learned from them to excel at the next stage. Summer projects are used for teachers to gauge what you learned from them and to see if you can use it on ""foreign"" material that you've never seen before. They do this because they want to see you win.

Another thing for why I say that these summer projects should be teacher designed is because when create these things; they pick what you need to better yourself. Like for instance one time when I was in the 6th grade going to the 7th grade; my teacher assigned me this big summer project. Everyone else in my class didn't have to anything as big, they all got little miniature projects to do. At first I thought my teacher was doing it out of spite and hatred for me. I almost started crying, but then I asked her when school was over, why my packet was one of the biggest ones out of everyone else. She looked at me and said the only reason my packet was one of the biggest in the class was because she believed in me and I was one of the smartest kids in the class; and that I could actually complete the whole thing if I put my mind to it. I almost agreed with her but then I asked how come I can't have a smaller one and she told me I could choose if I wanted to do this one or make a smaller one for myself. I almost went along with that for a second, but then I thought about just because I could pick what I wanted to work on, would that really benefit me in the long run. After I sat and thought about that for a second I just decided to roll with bigger packet because all my teacher was trying to do was help me better myself for the next level.

The final reason for why I say teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects is because they give you the work to help you, not to hurt you. I only say this because why would a teacher intentionally give you work they know you can't do unless they know you can do it if you put your mind to it. The only reason they give out summer projects is to help you. All this extra work is used to benefit you in every way possible. I used to think it was used to just make us not be able to have a fun summer; until I actually sat down and did it and then by the time the new school year came around, I already knew all the stuff they were teaching for the first semester.

So, in conclusion when it comes to summer projects, let students tell it, they should be the ones to design it. But, all in all teachers should be the ones to design it because they do it to benefit you in the long run, they know what you'll need for the next year, and last but not least they pick what you need to become a better you. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you on behalf of all students with a grade C average who would like to play sports. I think a grade C average shows that you can do better but you just choose not to because you ""don't see the purpose"". If students with a grade C average were given the opportunity to play sports this would be the boost they need to get and keep their grades at a B average or higher . When you play a sport you come to love it, it becomes a part of your life The sport is your life! That student knows that if they FALL BEHIND in school then they will get LEFT BEHIND in sports. I think you will see a huge improvement in the grades of your students.

I also think that sports are a way to get parents involved in their child's or children's school life. when a child plays a sport they want the parents to come to come to their games. When the parent sees their child in action they feel proud. This will motivate the parent to help their child with their school work so that the child can continue to play their sport.

Sports are not only good in school but they help outside of school also. They (they being sports) are a release for troubled children. They are a safe activity after school. They are some children's only chance at college. Sports will change a child's life. I know that you would love to be a part of that change.

In all i just hope that this paper gave you some insight on the minds of your students and helped you make the right choice.

Thank You For Your Time,

"Everyday, after school, I get my sister off the bus and watch her until my mom returns from work. I wouldn't be able to both do an extracurricular activity and watch her. Juggling both my own personal responsibilites and an extracurricular, on top of schoolwork, would be very stressful for me. I can't be expected to abandon by responsibilities for a school club. There are many reasons why I disagree with this dicision such as, people not being able to afford whatever they may be interested in, the students that stuggle with social anxiety and things lie it and the students who are already committed to something else after school.

One of the reasosn I disagree is that there are many actvities that would require money. There are students who are interested in these activities but won't be able to afford it. Those people who aren't able to afford it shouldn't have to pick something else just because they don't have the money. I know many kids who would be interested in sports but aren't able to pay the fees and by things like cleats, mitts, bats etc. Other actvities may do competitions which also require fees for them to be able to compete in them.

Secondly, there are many kids who struggle with social anxiety and other mental related things that could stop them from participating. Staying safe is a school rule and that rule doesn't go with just physical saftey but it also means that students should be and feel safe mentally too. Pushing them to do this could cause them to have an axiety attack or effect how they're dealing with their anxiety. Forcing a person that doesn't feel comfortable in social situations to participate in a group club is disregarding their feelings and their feelings should be taken into account.

Lastly, students may have their own responsibilities outisde of school. There are people, like me, who help watch their younger siblings after school. There are students who have a job that they have to go to work at school. Many people who go to our school already feel stressed trying to maintain good grades in the classes that their taking. Making a student do an extracuricular activity will just add to the stress that they may already be dealing with which can effect their emotional, mental and physical state.

In conclusion, my opinion is that students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities. This shouldn't be a \ the principle is allowed to decide due to everyones personal reasons for not being able to do it. The reasons that could cause people to not partcipate, are that people are struggling with mental things like social anxiety, there are kids who can't afford the things they're interested in and that some students already are commited to something unrealted to school. I think that these things should stop the principal from making this decision.             ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"I favour the election change to popular vote because the electoral college is not reliable.

In the second source,

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defences of the system are wrong, paragraph ten states ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" the whole point of an election is for the voter to vote for who they want not vote for someone who might not even stay true to their word.

Paragraph ten of the second sourse aslo states ""Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office."", ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" How can voters vote for someone who they don't even know? How can voters trust them not to betray them? This system has not been set up to benifit us, it basically makes us give power to the electors and hope for the best. This seems like a shot in the dark.

Paragraph sixteen in the third source says ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)"" yes it says it rarely happens but there is still a possibility that it will happen, it's inevitible.

"Graduating high school in four years is better than graduating high school in three years for several reasons. Firstly, graduating in four years allows for a more comprehensive education. High school is designed to provide students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for college and the workforce. This includes not only academic courses, but also extracurricular activities, such as sports and clubs. By graduating in four years, students have more time to participate in these activities and to explore their interests.

Secondly, graduating in four years allows for more time to develop social skills and relationships. High school is an important time for students to build relationships with their peers and to develop social skills that will serve them well in the future. By graduating in four years, students have more time to make friends, participate in social activities, and develop their social skills.

Finally, graduating in four years allows for more time to reflect on one's goals and aspirations. High school is a time of self-discovery and exploration, and by graduating in four years, students have more time to reflect on their goals and aspirations and to make informed decisions about their future. This can lead to a more fulfilling and successful college experience and beyond.

In conclusion, graduating high school in four years is better than graduating in three years because it allows for a more comprehensive education, more time to develop social skills and relationships, and more time to reflect on one's goals and aspirations. These benefits make graduating in four years a valuable and worthwhile experience for high school students.",1,llammistral7binstruct,0
"I think that the new technology entitled "" Facial Action Coding system "" (FACS) is a very smart and effective method of reading how someone feels just by there aperance me personaly I think that I can hid my emotions very well and can put on a fake smile and carry on with my day but knowing that theres technology that can read my face and tell me that im upset or angry thats amazing. I think that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a brilliant idea.

I support the new tecnology because Dr. Paul Ekman has classified six basic emotions such as - happiness,anger,surprise,disgust,sadness, and fear - and then associated each emotion with different movements of the facial muscles or characteristics. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrow when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) thightens your lips to show anger. The fact that there is classification on these six emotions just add on to the fact that this tecnology can become the next big thiing in todays society.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" ;""even though individuals often show varrying degrees of expressions"" Quoted from section (4)

meaining that the smile isn't as broad as normal and the fact that there is video imagray based off of the ""Facial Action Coding System"" (FACS) by using different units and weighing them is amazing and how they can tell your expressions just by veiwing your face and comparing it to a nuetrual face that isn't showing any emotion meaning the face doesn't show -happiness, sadness, anger, surpise, fear, and discust. I beleive that the Facial Action Coding System is a very brilliant form of technology and should be used on painting for many years to come because being able to finally tell the ""Mona Lisa's"" expression or facial recognition is amazing I couldve never told you if that painting was happy sad and or even angry and having a system that can do so is brilliant and extreamly useful. These are some of the resons that I personaly believe this system is worth using because it helps better understand peoples and or paintings expressions or faces. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"I think that the kids our age would be very disappointed to be kept from playing the sports selected for our school. Mainly because that most of the kids in the school don't have that opportunity at home. they don't have a tennis court, or a golfing range, a basketball court, nor a pool. In my opinion, i think we are very lucky to have the option to play the sports we like, or think we can be very good at because then later on in our college recommendations there would be no sports selected. See, for kids our age we look for electives we think we can be good at, or already have an act for. As like a side dish before going home to cooking, cleaning, babysitting, etc...

In my opinion i like tennis and basketball. I am on the bentwater tennis team, but they don't have a basketball team. That's why i tried out for the team last year. But this year i need to focus on my art, so I've given up basketball for this year and throughout high school I'm taking tennis for the team. And i don't think its fair to have kids have at least a grade B to participate in sports, cause my true opinion is that kids now, want to focus on their electives, mainly because its the side dish that they picked, knowing they HAVE TO have history, algebra, language arts, and science. But when their in that class they actually desire it gives them the perseverance to try harder in their other subjects. So if they don't have a B in a class, lets say its a C, so what? Eventually with the help that's required, i think it should be eligible for them to take the sport. Give them a reason to try harder in the sport, and in class. Lets just say that if they want to keep taking that sport, they have to go to tutoring twice a week, or three times a week. Plus some kids, need a way to cope with all the drama going on at home, or the bullying between other kids.

Some kids get bullied because of their weight, their clothes, anything, or maybe its just because the kids bullying them are just jealous. But the kids that are having to deal with that, need a way to get away from it all. In athletics it can be just running to let out your frustrations, or swimming just to cleanse your body of all the weight put on you at home, or tennis, just to wack the ball as hard as you can across the court to let out your anger. See in some way we all need a way to let out our emotions that we have bottled up inside of us. Me? My way is art. I've drawn so many things that i bet you cant even recognize, they might just be blobs of stuff, or skulls, or maybe even flowers, roses, happy faces, rainbows, when I'm happy. There is a way for everyone to let out their frustrations, and most people resolve those issues with sports. So i honestly don't think its fair for you to take away the sports academic program, let alone make us have the grades to get in. In some way, the grades we make are our choice, and you don't have us have all B' s to get into any other elective, why sports? And if you pass this school policy, i will bet you that there isn't gonna be as much kids as there would be even for just a team.

You can ask any kids that goes here, and i will be you 99.9% of them would say this policy is unspoken for, not fair and probably agree with what I've been trying to explain with this letter of recommendation. So now that i think i have gotten my point across, and you can actually see where im coming from im going to close this letter with a few words of my opinion.

"Although we rely on cars as a primary means of transportation for our busy lives there are many advantages to not using as much or even having them at all. Now driving in a car is very useful. It gets us where we want to go much faster than just biking or walking there. But there are many benefits and advantages to a world without cars. One advantage is that there will be less polution in the world. Another is that people will be just a little less lazy. And even more is that the world may be just a little quieter and safer with the lack of cars.

Thousands and thousands of people today are either driving a car or some other motorized means of transportation. And though yes they do provide a fasts way to get around, they give off so much exhaust into our relativly clean air and pollute it that its almost toxic to breathe in some places. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" it says that ""After days or near-record polution, Paris enforced a patial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Cars polluted the air so badly that in some places people completly banned them all together just to rid their air of the filth that the cars had created.

Many people in the world today have gotten lazier and cars have helped them get this way. Rather than ride a bike to their destination or even walk people decide to be lazy. They drive their car there or take a bus or taxi. But if people have to get up and walk to their destination rather than just walk to their cars it will make the world just a little bit better of a place to live. There may even be less stress in the world. No waiting in traffic and no yelling at others when they cut you off or drive too slow. The only problem or stress you may have to worry about is the crowd of people you may be walking with.

Now yet another advantage to a life without cars is that it will be quieter and safer. There won't be any honking of horns in your ears. There will not be any more roars of engines. No more yelling at other drivers for their ""lack of skill"" at driving. The world will be safer as well. No more people getting hit by cars while walking and no more car accidents. No more police car chases that put innocent civilians in danger of getting hit.

There are many advantages in life with no cars. A world without cars is less polluted. A world without cars is less stressfull. and it makes the world quieter and much safer. Cars are a basic part of life and we have grown used to them but the world may be a little better if they were no longer here.    ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"I believe that taking classes from home would have some benefits that are positive and negative more positive though than actually attending school and I have three major reasons why home learning would be more beneficial and less beneficial than what is offered in schools all across fcps but also I do believe that there are some things only attending school can offer so I will shine some light on that too.

I think that taking classes from home would allow you to have a better sleep schedule since classes usually start later around like 10,When at school it's way more difficult to get that full 8 or 9 hours of sleep because your either up late night studying for test or completing all the homework that some of these teachers give out. The typical 8-2 school days can also be very draining when you don't have the proper sleeping hours but if your classes would start later that would allow you to fully recharge your battery and wake up refresh also working in the comfort of your own bed would make you feel more relaxed and less tired and falling asleep lie most kids do in class.

E

ven though I agree with the prompt I do want to actually say that taking classes from home would lessen your social activity and there are just some things that only school can offer. The social aspect of school is a big reason and if you take online classes you''ll be missing that interaction with your peers,Which isn't exactly a good thing you are gonna feel more isolated and kinda lonely in a way not seeing your friends that you typically have classes with would have a toll on your mental state because sometimes the only reason kids come to school or attend school is to see your all your friends and even the ones you don't see outside of school. There just some benefits that only school can offer like electives you can't take most electives online like gourmet foods and advanced PE so at the same time school does have some elements too it that set you up for the real world in a way.

Lastly I believe that online courses would just be a better way to teach kids because in most cases the classroom environment is just too much and to overwhelming sometimes early in the morning and in general,I think that working from the comfort of your home would allow you to be more comfortable to ask questions that you usually wouldn't ask in a classroom and you would be more focus since it isn't the pressure being with 29 other students that may get it quicker than you do. When your typically in class and your working on an assignment your teacher is usually going around helping everyone well most kids need a 1 on 1 with just you and the teacher and you normally can't get that so I believe that online courses would give you that 1 on 1 feel and that honestly can make an F turn into an A in some cases,In most colleges though your gonna be in a big classroom withe even more kids so I do think school does get you used to that kinda feel so it isn't all bad with the classroom environment. I also wanna say that sometimes the pacing of some classes can just be too much with quizzes and test every other class and all that studying but in that online class it's gonna feel better since it's a smaller classroom and you feel like there just cramping information into your brain.

In conclusion I believe that home learning is better overall wise but that school does have it's benefits too and that I feel like home learning would kinda make you lazier in a way and that school leaning sets you up for the future more bu at the same time home learning would be way more efficient academic wise since your typically more isolated from your friends and can focus.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Extracurricular Activities: A Necessary Requirement?

As an 8th grader, I think it's pretty cool that our school requires us to participate in an extracurricular activity. I know some people might think it's a hassle, but I think it's actually really beneficial.

First of all, it's a great way to meet new people. I joined the robotics club this year, and I've made some really cool friends who are into the same things as me. We're like a little team, and we work together to build and program our robot for competitions. It's a lot of fun, and I never would have met these people if I hadn't joined the club.

Another good thing about extracurricular activities is that they help you learn new skills. Like, I never would have learned how to program a robot if I hadn't joined the robotics club. It's a really useful skill to have, and it's something that I can put on my college application. Plus, it's just really cool to be able to say that I can program a robot!

I also think that extracurricular activities are good for your brain. When you're doing something you're interested in, it's easier to focus and learn. Plus, it's a way to take a break from school work and have some fun. It's like, you get to do something you love, and it's not even work!

Some people might say that requiring extracurricular activities is too much, but I think it's actually a good way to keep kids engaged. Like, if we didn't have to do anything outside of school, some kids might get bored and start acting out in class. But with extracurricular activities, they have something else to focus on and look forward to.

Of course, there are some downsides to extracurricular activities. Sometimes they can be really time-consuming, and it can be hard to balance them with school work. And sometimes you might not find something that you're really interested in, which can be frustrating. But",1,llama2_chat,2
"I agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, no matter who they are. An extracurricular activity is an activity that enhances the knowledge of a particular subject. It goes beyond the standard curriculum that is taught in classes at school. This activity could be formal like an honors society, math league, or engineering program, or you could take a more active route and play football, track, or swim. The list could go on and on, ensuring that students can find an activity they're interested in participating in.

Participating in at least one extracurricular could give you greater opportunities for the future. It could help you manifest your desired college. Colleges really like when a student is involved with an extracurricular and it makes sense why. It shows that you are willing to go deeper in your learning of a subject. This drive to push yourself can also reflect in your work ethic, benefiting your grades and mindset. If this behavior continues, it could help you in the future with any job you have and even get you, or help you find, your dream career.

An extracurricular provides a fun environment. If you are truly doing what you are interested in, it should be enjoyable. They are also a great way to socialize and get out of the house. You can meet many new and great friends along the way. An Extracurricular can create a safe environment for students. Students feel like they belong somewhere and can be themselves alongside others that share the same passion as them.

I positively agree that a student should be in at least one extracurricular. They don't even have to take up that much time. There are an amazing amount of opportunities and benefits that come from them that shouldn't be passed. It could just be something to do after school, or it could be what you love to do. An extracurricular is great for everybody.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Students across the nation often spend their year day dreaming about the summer break, but when they are assigned summer assignments by their teachers, their dreams may feel crushed. Teachers are mostly the ones that create these assignments, but is that the best way to do it? If students were able to design their own summer assignments it might just take some of the weight off their shoulders while completing it. Summer assignments should be student-designed because it will motivate them to complete it, encourage them to be creative, and cater to the minds of the students.

If the students are the ones creating their project, they would be more motivated to complete it. When kids are having fun over the summer they do not usually stop and think about their school work, but if they were to design it, it may spark more interest for them. Students putting their own personal touch on to their assignment would make it less like work and more like fun. Teachers often assign large packets full of information, but by doing so, their students will procrastinate this long chore. Students are more likely to create an interactive and less detail packed assignment. Summer is a time for students to have a break from school, and when they get to make their projects themselves, it makes them not feel burdened about completing it.

When kids are given the task of designing themselves a summer project, they will most likely think more creatively than their teachers. Younger people are known to have a better creativity than their older counterparts. When students collaborate, their minds all put together should create a very interesting outcome. Their ideas would likely be more interactive than information driven. With more interactive projects, kids would also be creative while completing the project. Creativity increases effort which results in better grades. Teachers may think that their content filled assignments will benefit their students academics, but the truth is that kids need room for creativity in order to absorb information.

Perhaps the most important reason students should design their summer assignments is because it would cater to their own minds. The students are the ones that are completing these assignments, so they should know what is best for them. Students know what kinds of assignments weigh them down and which don't. They would create projects that a relevant to their lives. Teachers were all students at one point, but times change very quickly. What was once helpful to a teacher, may no longer be helpful for student in the present. A student-designed project would be made with their best interests in mind. Kids will design their projects to what fits best for them over the summer.

All in all, students should design their own summer assignments because they will be more likely to complete it, they would put more thought into it, and they know what is best for themselves. Teacher-designed projects may have quality information, but students are not often inclined to do heavy work loads over the summer. Since students are the ones that have to complete their projects, they should be the one that design it. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"When people go to others for help they often are strugiling with a important decision or a tragity. They might go to the people they know best, or a theripist or teacher. Another reason to go to multiple people for advice could be that one person may be better at giving advice than others. If someone gives you bad advice it could make you go down the wrong path or make the wrong decision. You should only go to people you can trust for advice becuase they will give you what would help you specificaly.

When asking for advice, going to multiple people for the same question could give you different answers that you could pick and chose from to find what would be most helpful for your situation. For example, when I ask for advice I might go to a parent, a friend, a teacher, and a guidance councler with the same question. With the information I had gathered I could decide what would be most useful for me. When I was applying for my highschool classes, I asked my mom to help me, I asked my highschool sister what she would recomend, I asked the guidince councler, and I asked my peers. With the information I had recieved, I chose the classes that I thought would be most suitable for me.

If someone is suffering from a tragity like the loss of a family member, freind, or pet advice could be very important and could really help change the way they are feeling about the matter at hand. When my dog passed away a few weeks ago, I went to multiple different people for help. Everyone I talked to was very supportive and made me feel better about the situation. without going to multiple people I might not have been able to recover from the incident as quickly as I have been able to.

If you are ever strugiling with loss are a decition getting help could be very benificial. It worked for me many times in the past, and it has helped many of the people I know. Getting advice and telling people how you are felling is always a option to help recover from a tragity or make the right decision. I have always used this tactict and will in the future. I would recomend it to anyone that needs help. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear Senate,

I think we should change the election by popular vote, because with the electoral college not everyone is getting to vote like they should be doing. The Electoral College selects the electors, so the canadates are gonna choose the electors that have things in common with them so they win the election. Voters vote for a slate of electors, they dont get to vote for President.

The Electoral College is unfair because the winner-take-all system makes it so candidates don't spend time in the states they know their not gonna win. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and you need at least 270 votes to elect the President. The Electoral College process is so much more complicated and long than popular vote, so why do we still use the Electoral College? We shouldn't.

Im not the only one that thinks this way. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and so many more people think that we should abolish the Electoral College. And soon its gonna get to out of hand and then were not gonna have a President. Their gonna make it so the Electoral College votes for everything! Abolish it!            ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"As students are furthering their education, teachers are assigning summer assignments in order to prepare them for their upcoming class. Many believe these summer assignments should be student designed due to students' convenience, nevertheless, these summer assignments should be teacher designed because it ensures that students are prepared for the class, exposes them to new material outside of their comfort zone, and keeps students' busy throughout the break.

Before the school year ends, teachers take time out of their work day to produce a summer assignment for their students' next school year. Having teacher designed summer assignments help ensure that students are ready for the content in their upcoming year. Students are unable to know their struggles with next years content until they are actually in that class. Teachers are able to look at their lower scoring topics of the year and put a couple questions of that topic onto the summer assignment. By doing this, it will help the students learn from the past students' struggle topics. Because of the summer assignment, students are able to get a boost and learn quicker when they are being taught in class. An example of this happened during a student's sophomore year while picking their junior year classes. This particular student had to choose between academic biology or honors biology; they were unsure of which class they wanted to take. The student eventually choose honors biology in the end; she found out that about the summer assignment due the first week of classes. She struggled with converting units and was nervous the topic would be a struggle in the class. Her teacher assured her that it was normal to struggle as many other students struggled with that as well. She complained on and on until she came into class that next year and excelled due to the summer assignment she completed. If the student had designed her own summer assignment, she would not have excelled as well as she did because of the teacher designed summer assignment.

As teachers are designing their own summer assignment for their class, they put new material that the students have never been exposed to. While many express how having student designed summer assignments give students more freedom; they don't realize how most students will not go outside of their comfort zone to learn new material. If the students were to design their own summer assignment, all of the material will be information that they already knew or are most comfortable with. Teacher designed summer assignments will give a chance for the student to push themselves out of their comfort zone to learn new information that will ultimately help them with their next school year. For example, the summer before junior year, an AP Language and Composition teacher gave students an assignment that included reading or watching 15 sources. These 15 sources had to be stretched out from 5 different categories: current events, history, politics, entertainment, and documentaries. The students were forced out of their comfort zone by their teacher having their students exposed to all of the different categories. Because of the exposure, the students are aware of information they would not have known if they didn't complete the assignment. When given the chance, students will stay in their own comfort zone; which the teachers can break when there are teacher designed summer assignments.

When the teachers are trying to break students' comfort zones with the summer assignments, it gives the students a chance to think outside of the box and spend more time trying to interpret the new information. For most students, summer break is filled with eating and watching TV on their couch; if the students were given the chance to design their own assignment for the break, they would put easy information for them to complete in order for them to have more time to spend on the couch eating chips. The students would come back with their minds still tangled up with the TV and couch; if teachers were to design the assignment, the teachers would put information that they know would keep the students' minds busy and working throughout the summer. This makes it easier for students to ease back into school; rather than them still being in summer mode 3 months into the school year.

Being eased back into the school year is a thing many students struggle with. It can be fixed by having teacher designed summer assignments. It is time for all teachers to regulate teacher designed summer assignments in order to make the school year easier for all students. While many students will complain about the workload, it will pay off later when they realize the summer assignment helped them with the content of the class. They will also be interested in new topics because of the teachers input in the summer assignment to push them outside of their comfort zone. Overall, summer assignments have been proven to assist students all around when they are teacher designed. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Principal,

I think you should have Policy 1: allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

I strongly think this should be one of our rules because like me, and many other students we need our phone throughout the day. We should have this policy because most people would be on track more. We would know what time it was, and stay on track on where we needed to be. We could also easily call home if we left homework or other things we need for school, so more people would have homework to turn in for there classes all the time. So that would lead to more people getting better grades.

Another reason this should be our school policy is that on our phone there is tools to help for math, like the calculator. If a student left there's at home, or lost there's, they could have one on their phone to use.

Another thing is that our phone could help with stress at school. if we have free time we don't want to worry about school and homework, and have a break from it all. Also, we just want to have relax, or have fun for a half hour, or an hour.

"I believe the ''Facial Action Coding System'' is a original idea that nobody has never thought of that till now. Teachers can know now when students are not really interested in a assignment or its boring. '' A class computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.''Teachers need to know when a student is not feeling well. So you now not to push the students buttons.

The students point of view is that it will be way more better .''Then it could modify the lesson, like an affective human instructor.''My own opinion is that if we had those ''Facial Action Cody System'' would help alot,so the teachers know when we are not interested in a assignment that they end up giving us.''Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help produce them.''Not even does this idea help you produce feelings like (happy,sad,and disgusted) them in a drama class, but even tells the teachers what you feel also.

''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking by the look on your face.'' i wish we had this idea at my school but we dont.''of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial that conveys happy,worried,etc..''

"Dear state senator,

I dont think it is very fair that you tell people there vote counts but what a lot of people dont know is that it doesn't. Instead it consists of 538 electoral voters who use the majority rule to elect the president. There are millions of voters who are just wasting there time on election day voting on who they think should be president. Did you know over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election over a electoral college. 60 percent!

That's majority rule right there and you still havn't done anything about it. When people vote they are voting for the president not for a slate of electors. Not only is that false advertising but it's wrong. Vote for president Obama the signs say but do they really mean it? I guess not.

Just think if you were a voter and you thought it counted. i think you should change from the electoral college to the popular vote. Look what the electoral college has made for presidents over the past century. George Bush went to war with irag and Afghanistan making us far into dept. Then they voted for Obama who is taking over 20 TRILLION DOLLARS from China, and how does he expect to pay them back?

Very simple, he is just gonna brush it off like nothing is happening and wait for re-election and pass the dept off to the new president. So, if popular vote was now going on i think the public would be better at deciding whether or not one person deserves to be president more then the other. Ill let you decide.

"Want to know why a person goes to more then 1 person for advice. they probly go to more then 1 person is becuase they wont get the same answers every time and wantr to see what other people say. When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person.

First reason is they still need advice someone told them advice but still don't understand and need more explanation and more of a simple way of being said. Maybe that first advice wasnt good enough and need more advice becuase they want something that is easier for tthem to understand. Maybe the person getting the advice doesn't know that something means and needs to know what it means.

Second reason is they probly need advise for a problem that they might have. They probly ask more than 1 person becuase they want to see what different answer they can get. They also may becuase they might have a problem going on and don't know what to do and ask for help and advice. They also may be in a serious siuwation and need advice badly to make their next more.

Last reason will be that they probly need advice to get better at something they want to do better or get better at. They also may want to get better at play games and want to become better so they might ask a couple of people for advice. They also might want to get better at drawing ask their friends that know how to draw for a little advice. They also want to get better at cooking so they ask their mom for help and advice.

People ask for more than 1 person for advice because they will get different ansers every time.

"Dear Principal,

I think you should consider allowing students to bring phone's to school and let them use them during lunch period's and other free times, just as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I think this because, wonder if it was an emergency? They're parents try calling the office but the secretary doesn't answer, so they text the child but the teacher's don't let them answer it or else the cell will be confiscated. But the parent need's to get a hold of them! What do they do? By not answering the parent could be risking something very big.

Also, if the kid wants to use they're cell phone to show his/her friend a really cool recording of his best friends band! Or if they want to call they're father that they never see or get to talk to, but school time is the only time he isn't at work so he can answer. What's the problem with that? There is no harm done whatsoever! Or, maybe they just want to take a picture of his friends to put on 'face book' or one of those shindig websites. I don't see what the problem is as long as it isn't done during class time. When the students walk into class, teacher's should check if the cell phone is off, just to prove that the kid isn't texting or playing games on his/her phone during the time that they are supposed to be learning.

I honestly don't understand what the problem is with having cell phones during lunch and free periods! I just don't get it! It's not like they could kill somebody with they're cell phone or create any harm. I understand how they aren't allowed to be on during class time, that's understandable. But not the fact that they cant have it on while they are not in class. In lunch time and other free periods, they aren't learning ,kids are usually hanging out with they're friends. There is no problem with using they're cell's while with friend's.

I think you should take this letter into consideration and consider allowing cell phone's to be used during lunch and free period's, but not during class.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As our principal, you of all people should understand that while community service is an excellent thing to do for our school, we have other things that can leave us with very little time to do community service throughout the school year. After school activities or clubs, sports, and homework given to us can make us unwilling to participate in mandatory community service.

I do think some community service is always a good thing, but a large mandatory amount may teach students to disrelish the idea of community service. On the other hand, I do see helping the community as an important issue. I am partially in agreement for both suggestions, but I believe a medium can be found. Perhaps we can pick a day in school where we can go on a field trip of sorts, to do community service.

Community service projects such as tutoring could also perhaps be offered as extra credit, to prove that the student is knowledgeable enough of the topic in question to teach it to a younger or equally aged person about it. Community service might also be able to be chosen as an elective to go on a record for high school or college, showing that the particular student has an interest in helping the community.

In summarization, I believe that students should not be forced to perform community service. I do believe, however, that benefits should be provided to those that do. This would give many kids a contrivance and a reason to performing community service, such as something to put on an application, or extra credit points, even a diminutive amount could aid a student.

"Limited car use has dramatically reduced the amount of enviromental toxins in the air in some cities. Paris, France and Bogota, Colombia have banned car use for a day and have seen the air clean up just because very few cars were being driven. One community in Germany even banned the use of cars in general. The enviroment is in dire need of help and we can help it. If everyone took one day out of the week where we did not drive anywhere and on the other six days we drove as little as possible and carpooled the air would be so much cleaner. Not driving also has added health benefits, walking or biking everywhere is a good way to excersise.

A new kind of suburb has been created in Germany where cars are not allowed. There are a few roads on the perimeter of the city that allow cars to be driven but besides that residents walk or bike everywhere. There is little pollution in the air and residents are able to take a tram into neighboring cities. Seventy percent of families do not have a car and fifty-seven percent of families sold their car to live in this community. If you own a car in this community you can buy a parking spot for forty thousand dollars. One resident, Heidrum Walter, said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier that way."" Lack of cars also gives parents peace of mind, cars are still dangerous machines and in this community their kids can play without their parents worrying about them getting involved in an accident.

Paris' pollution rates have been rising over the years and hit almost record level highs for a few days, so in order to reduce the amount of smog in the air there was a temporary car ban. One day anyone who has a even-number license plate was not allowed to drive. If you were caught driving you had to pay a fine that is equalivant to thirty-one U.S. dollars. The smog miraculosly cleared up quickly and people were able to drive again. Another city in Columbia, Bogota, holds a ""Day Without Cars"", once a year. Citizens are allowed to use public buses and taxis during this day. The government is trying to advocate for public transportation and smog reduction. Most people walk on this day and even though it has rained on this day before citizens participated just the same.

When you choose to walk or bike everywhere it not only makes an impact on the enviroment but it also reduces your risks for dieseases like obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Obesity rates in America are a lot higher than they should be and that's partially due to lack of physical activity. By walking or biking to work or to school you reduce that risk because your heart rate is up and your body is moving. Of course if people stop driving obesity will still exist due to our horrible eating habits but it would help a lot. If there was less driving it would also be beneficial to our health because we would be breathing cleaner air. The air we breathe is often times highly polluted and if there was less cars not as many deadly chemicals would be in the air. There would still be cigarette smoke and factory pollution but it would be dramatically less.

If people in America reduced their driving time it would be better for the air and better for us. Many other cities have proposed an annual day without cars so I think cities in America should start doing it. We only have one world and although we have done a pretty horrible job of taking care of it, that does not mean we can't attempt to fix the mess we made.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Dear Principal,

There is no need to change the school's policy so that students with a B average or above may be the only ones aloud to participate in sports and other school activities. Granted, students must keep up with their school work, but level of book smarts does not effect the qualities for sports or other activities.

Sports are based on levels of fitness, not brain activity. If a student excels in a sport, he or she should not be limited to access of achieving their goals in this sport because they are not at a high academic level. Limiting their ability to participate in what they excel in can take away many opportunities. For example, one of your students has the skill to play on a professional sports team, but unfortunately they are not allowed to participate in sports at school because they have a C average. A C average today in math class doesn't determine their future as a MVP.

Taking a student out of sports and other activities will not promise higher grades. Some students have learning disabilities that prevent them from learning to the standard that reaches a B average or above. Sports and other activities can stimulate the mind and actually help with learning. By allowing the students to participate in both sports and class they have a more likely chance to improve in both.

Many students have a C average in school. There is no statement that this is because sports or other activities are preventing a higher grade. It is possible that the students do not understand the topics as well because they are not being taught how they need to be taught.

I understand that one believes that by not allowing students to participate in sports or other activities will limit their focus to school work, therefore allowing more time towards education. Still, to live a healthy and well-rounded life, one must have the options to participate in activities other than school work.

Although you are considering the policy to chance, keeping the policy to allow any student participate in sports and other activities will permit them with chances of a better, well-rounded future. Think of the students futures above what they learn today and may not excel in.",0,persuade_corpus,3

community service for students should be only for kids who deserve it not for others.

but kids who want to do it should be able to do if they want to.

for those who don't should have the right to say no i don't want to do that.

but community service is a nice thing to do if you really feel like doing it.

you shouldn't be forced to do it though because we have the right to say no.

kids should be paid a couple dollars if they put effort into the community service.

community service is almost like labor cause people are working when they don't want to work.

so to make a kid work like that is almost like child labor.

only if people want to work then it wouldn't be labor cause it would be something that they want to do right. so if we kids do want to work we have rights we can say no.

community service should only be judged by the court of law not by schools.

anybody who has done community service before probably is use to it.

but people that are new to it might be a little scared. or maybe even not wanting to do it.

that's why it should be referred to labor because we don't want to do it.

so really if students want to be in on community service then that's fine but if not then they should not have to join. me i wouldn't go to community cause it might not be good for me to always worry about my sugar.

but if you ask me i might clean up a thing or 2 because i partly care about our world.

"If you were a teacher trying to teach a class with over 20 people with different emotions, how efficent would it be to know how all of them feeling? You can do that with FACS (Facial Action Coding System), created by Dr. Pail Eckman. This system classifys 6 basic emotions. It can sense happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This is good for teacher who dont understand how their student are feeling about the assignment they assigned.

Dr. Huang, says in paragraph four, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" He says, "" even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" Using video imagery, the emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements on a real face or even a picture. The author uses an example of the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci. They used the emotion-recongnition on the painting and it showed how Mona Lisa was feeling. It not only looks at how your smiling or how your eye are placed, it also looks at the structure of ur face and how your muscles move.

This creation can help lots of teacher all around the world understand and help students learn more efficently. Every single student learns differently and using this system will help teacher use their teaching time wisely. When student dont understand somthing this system can scan your face and tell the teacher what needs to be fixed to help the student understand and enjoy what they are learning.

Instead of teachers trying to help one student at a time they can help multiple students at once.

You can also use FACS not only in school but other places too. You can use it in work and also in everyday life if you wanted too. In paragrah nine the author talks about a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky. He had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Just making different faces can revel a lot about the science of emotion.

FACS is the next big thing. Science has gone to a whole new level in helping our society. Using this system can help all kinds of people in different ways. I think this can help our world grow and learn new things. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that an extra hour and a half in school can have a significant impact on a student's ability to complete homework and get enough sleep. While some may argue that the additional time can be used to complete homework or review material, I believe that it can also have negative consequences on a student's mental and physical health.

Firstly, an extra hour and a half in school can lead to increased stress and anxiety levels. Students may feel overwhelmed with the amount of work they have to complete, leading to a decrease in their productivity and mental health. This can also lead to a decrease in their ability to focus and concentrate on their work, making it difficult for them to complete their homework effectively.

Secondly, an extra hour and a half in school can also lead to a decrease in a student's sleep quality. Students may feel tired and fatigued throughout the day, leading to a decrease in their ability to concentrate and learn effectively. This can also lead to a decrease in their overall academic performance, as they may struggle to retain information and complete assignments.

To address these potential challenges, I propose the following solutions to the school board:

1. Flexible scheduling: Instead of adding an extra hour and a half to the school day, the school board could consider implementing flexible scheduling options. This could include offering students the option to start or end their school day earlier or later, allowing them to better manage their time and prioritize their responsibilities.
2. Homework policies: The school board could also consider implementing more realistic homework policies that take into account the needs and abilities of each student. This could include limiting the amount of homework assigned or providing students with more time to complete their assignments.
3. Mental health resources: Finally, the school board could consider providing students with access to mental health resources, such as counselors or support groups, to help them manage their stress and anxiety levels. This could also include implementing policies to reduce bullying and promote a positive school culture.

In conclusion, while an extra hour and a half in school may seem like a good idea, it can have negative consequences on a student's mental and physical health. The school board should consider implementing flexible scheduling options, homework policies, and mental health resources to address these potential challenges and ensure that students are able to complete their homework and get enough sleep.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"Dear Principal, I believe in policy 2. Kids are irresponsible when it comes to cell phone use during school. They will be unfocused during class and have the option of cheating.

Policy 2 is best because with policy 1, students will disobey it. Policy 1 says that students can have their phones during free time like lunch and in between classes but at our school, the kids wont listen. For example, a kid has their phone out at lunch and is texting their friend. The lunch bell rings saying lunch is over and class will begin soon. Most likely will the kid continue texting during class then saying goodbye and texting their friend after school.

Say everyone listened to policy 1. Kids are focused in class and cell phones are put away. Everyone is following rules and not using their phone. Though, some kids who have had different classes then the other, sit together at lunch, because their friends. They have the option of texting one the answers to the test one of them already took. This would make the person use their cell phone during class. This would not only disobey the policy but cause the person to cheat. Instead of cheating, we should put cell phones away all together.

"Dear Principal,

I think your first policy is better because then maybe student will know not to use there phones in class when you gave them the privilege to use it during free time and at lunch. Also if you tell them they can only use it during free time and lunch the might like it because at least they are using there phones in school. Maybe it will help them focus more giving them an opportunity to use there phone in school. If you chose policy 2 that will get kids upset and make them want to use there phones in school even more. Like people say if you tell kids not to do something the still do. So policy 1 is better because by letting them use there phones in school them might have the scenes not to use there phones in class because the don't want to lose the privilege of using there phones in school. It will make kind understand that they are given an opportunity to have some free time to use there phones and they wouldn't want to mess that up. If kind don't listen and start using there phones in class again then that's when you cant enforce policy 2, but some kind wont listen. Some kind will try and hide there phones if you try to enforce policy 2 because they know if you tell them to do some thing they don't want to they will still do it despite what you have to say.",0,persuade_corpus,0

Luke had no idea that his life would change. When your a Seagoing Cowboy you travle alot on a boat on the water. Its alot of hard work too. You have to feed and water the animals three times a day. You had to pulled bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower ships . Also the stalls had to be clean. That cept luck busy.

There are good opportunitys that happen when you are a

Seagoing Cow boy. When your saililng to different countries you may find somthing enjoying. Luke got to tour China and got to ride Gondola .

"Driverless cars are coming, should we let them? Well with the technology we have today why not? They would be benificial for our race. While some people may see them as just another difficulty we would have to work out, think of all the accidents it would prevent. The future is with technology we can't be afraid of it. Our objective in science and technology is to increase our life span and enjoy our lives more, driverless cares would promote both.

With all of the accidents that happen every day, would driverless cars cause more problems in comparison? While the person in the driver's seat may not be ready to take the wheel. The driverless cars that have been made already alert you, giving a reminder that you still need to remain alert. For example GM's, General Motors, car has an alert system that makes the deriver's seat vibrate when the driver is required. While the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. These inventions help prevent one of many obstacles the driverless cars will provide, all of witch can be prevented.

Another problem would be the worry of hackers with technology today. Because Tesla's cars are all ran on one mega computer what is to stop it from being hacked? This could cause huge problems. Cyber-terrorism would be a big concern but even that is preventable. Apple's phones have been out for awhile now and still havn't been hackable, not even by our government. With our advances in technology we can put a stop to most accidents. So will there still be law suits agaisnt companies if an accident does occur?

Well while technology advances our laws remain. Take into consideration that while there would still be problems, there would be far fewer than before. Don't make laws prohibiting driverless cars! That only slows down what is too come and makes it harder to fix mistakes that the vehicles will have! All humans make mistakes even the ones behind computers. I would rather have multiple people who work daily with time on their hands fixing problems that would come along than people who are driving daily and in the right moment forced to make a split second decision without full thought. I will put my trust in these vehicles and I hope others will too. If laws are truely there to focus on keeping drivers, passengers and pedestrians safe then why deny something that would make traveling safer.

Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems will be solved. However their technology won't be able to give the pleasure of driving to those who wish to drive. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver admits that. Some manufaturers hope to still make it fun by providing entertainment systems. While they can be truned of instantly if manual driving is needed, it would still be safer than having people today who text with cell phones while they drive.

Google has already had self driving cars since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Is this alone not proof enough of the benefit it would be? How many miles can humans drive without a crash compared to this? Google's cofounder Sergey Brin believes automatic cars would fundamentally change the world. So should we let the cars come? I believe so.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Eliminating car usage can benefit ones life in many ways. Vauban, Germany, is a community where street parking is forbidden, and as a result, many residents have just given up their cars. Residents seem to prefer it this way as well. ""When I had a car I was always tense...I'm much happier this way,"" says Heidrun Walter, a resident. Cars emit up to 50% of greenhouse gas in some car-intensive aareas in the United States. As a result of the minimal car usage in Vauban, stores are being renovated to being a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Polution and smog are another big problem caused by car usage. Paris had once enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, due to a near-record pollution and smog problem. Bogota, Columbia, has an annual Day Without Cars, where car transportation, with the exception of buses and taxis are banned. This is done in an attempt to clear smog. Violators are charged with a $25 fine.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Imagine if you are sitting in a classroom and your trying to finish your test before you have to turn it in and your concentrating really hard and you have a bunch ideas of what to write and someone's phone goes off and you forget all you were thinking of and you have to turn in a incomplete assignment. If cell phones were banned from schools, students would not be distracted in school by them. Cell phones do have their uses, but those uses are not for school. Although cell phones are a way parents can reach their children it should not be allowed because kids are distracted by cell phones, and students can use cell phones to bully other students.

Cell phones are a huge distraction for students when trying to concentrate or be productive. Kids will stop what they are doing to text back their friend and take time away from the student and the student they are texting. Students texting in class takes time away from the student, the teacher, and the kids around the student. Whatever they are talking about can surely wait till they get out of school.

Furthermore, students having cell phones in school increases the chance of cyber-bullying. Cyber bullying is when kids send mean and hurtful things to another student. It is not only hurtful things, but they can send threats to a student. if a student feels threatened they will not be able to concentrate or work. school is a safe environment for kids and if they are being threatened they will be scared to even come to school.

Although cell phones are a way for parents to reach their child during an emergency, if everyone's parent called their child at the same time it wouldn't even go through. Most of the time its the parents who call their child when they are in class, disrupting the whole class. If it was a real emergency they could call the school and ask for you. having a cell phone at school isn't a necessity and its a distraction to a students learning and kids go to school to learn, not to talk on their phones.

In conclusion, cell phones should be banned from schools because although they do have their uses, they are a huge distraction to students and having it increases the chance of children being cyber-bu",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Required Essay: Phones & Driving

Starting in the 1996, cell phones became very important to people's everyday life. Cell phones started as huge bulky items that were not able to fit in a pocket. Now, they are an everyday item that is carried in someone's pocket, purse, etc. After they became wireless they played a ever bigger role in life. Cell phones were starting to be used in cars for GPS and playing music through bluetooth. People started to take advantage of using a cell phone while driving and things went down from there. People should be able to use their cell phones while driving for navigation to wherever they are going , to contact anyone for an emergency, and hands free answering phone calls.

GPS navigation system is one of the main reason people use their cell phones while driving. If driving from Georgia to New York with a map or using road signs, because you can't use cell phones while driving, you are going to make a lot of mistakes and many u-turns. Using a cell phone for navigation is the best way to get to your destination the fastest and easiest. According to Baldwin Ellis, "" Cell phones allow users to call for directions when they cannot find their destinations. Furthermore, many cell phones have GPS technology that provide turn-by-turn directions to any destination and maps that provide real-time traffic information."" (Ellis). This shows that GPS navigation on cell phones are helpful to show real information going on around the area and send you a better route. While using the GPS you can also talk on the phone while GPS gives you directions on where to go at the same time.

Most people like to talk to people on the phone while driving. Whenever your phone rings it's an instinct to go reach for it and pick it up. It's more safe to listen and talk to the person on the phone through the car than holding the phone up to your ear and driving with one hand. With bluetooth in a car, you wouldn't be breaking the hands free law. According to "" Benefits to Having Bluetooth in Your Car"" article, ""the Bluetooth capabilities you end up with will save you from receiving a ticket and also making it easier for you to keep your hands on the wheel."". This shows that bluetooth is the key to not breaking any law your state made about hands free. Using Bluetooth can also help with texting and driving. Instead of picking up your phone and texting some back, you can use bluetooth the say your message and send text out loud. According to "" Benefits to Having Bluetooth in Your Car"" article, ""Many offer Bluetooth capabilities, which will help to alleviate the temptation of manually texting."" . Don't even think of reach for your phone when you hear you got a text just get Bluetooth in your car. It's better to get bluetooth than being in a car accident for texting and driving.

You will need your phone while driving if something serious happened or is happening and you need emergency services quick. Without your phone, you would be stuck out on the road during the day or even night with no one to help. Most people definitely don't like to stop for people even when they see they're in trouble. According to ""NHTSA's Office of Emergency Medical Services"" , ""emergency telephone calls presented to the switchboard in May 2017 was 845,674, an average of 27.3 thousand per day."". This shows that many people use their phone to call EMS when any type of situation or car crash happens.

As you can see driving with your phone is not bad at all unless you make it bad. Although people make using cell phones bad, it's very helpful to everyday things you do in a car. You wouldn't like to sit in silence not knowing where to go and then suddenly your car breaks down and you don't know what else to do. Cell phones are needed in everyday life. Why try and take that from us just because we are in a car, but there are ways to help prevent anything going bad while using them while driving.         ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"This is about if i suport students atending class online at home?

i think that yes if they put their mind to it. And i think if they want to pass all their grades if they are doing school at home and they really want to do it then yes If they do the all their sentens well and all their paragh well.

Aslo i think that if they are home schooled that they might do the work when they want to do it some of them will not care about it and some might just forgetand outher will say they will do it latter.

Sometime the mom/dad dose not help the student but most of the time the student want to do home school and want to pass then yes it depends on the student. when any student dose school at home they will often not do the work they aslo dont learn all the things the the school teaches they learn what the mom/dad knows.

I will say i suport it but i also dont suport becuas like i said most kids dont do the work but also some do the work. most kids when they are home schooled the mom/dad send them to school becuas they dont know what elas to teach them some just do it just to get school over with and when the mom/dad send them to school they some times llike but they aslo end up droping out of school.

Most student do benift from atending class at home but if they put their mind to it and do the work some time they learn like that becuas theirs no one that bothers them they do the work at their own speed on what they know.

most student come to school when they are home school they dont know most of the things that they learning that is becuas they didn't learn much when they where atending the class at home online becuas they were offten on their phone most of the time not caring about the work, or becuas they sleep late. Some student do know more when they are home schooled some times more then what they a student that gose to public school.

but most students that are home school they some times want to go to public school they want to go beacus they want to learn more thing make frend they rather go to public school to learn more beacuas they benn doing home school for most of the school year. some time its beacuas of their mom/dad scared that some thing might happen to their kid they dont trust their kid going to public school beacuas they might do some bad thiing.

im sure that students benefitfrom home school some take colleg class at home some start their corears but taking online class at home or some just do the things/follow the step their perent.

sometime when they are home schooled they have to go to school beacuas they have family problems or beacuas they just dont like being home scholled no more beacuas they want to do more things they wan tot learn more beacuas they feel like they are not learing the thing that they are learnig at home.

The things they learn some times aint right if they are learnig it frome their mom/dad if they are not doing the class online. But i think if they are doing the online class doing what they have to do to know what they want to be in life get thru all the the online class.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Distance learning is becoming more common as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. By doing this, individuals will be gaining an education without being in a public or private school environment. People have a variety of different opinions on distance learning through distinguishing pros and cons. I think students will not benefit from distance learning because students are less likely to be motivated, lose social skills, and lose preparation for college life.

Students are more motivated when having a teacher right in front of them to do what they are supposed to do. If students were to learn through distance learning, students can easily lose focus on their school work and put it aside without a teacher pushing them in the right direction. When there is a reason for me to stay home from school, I am never motivated to start my schoolwork. Students need guidance from a teacher that is physically in front of them rather than online or video conferencing. Without this, students lose their motivation and could fall behind in their academics. It is much easier for students to fall behind more instead of catching up when there is no motivation there to keep going. Also, students are all different and learn in different ways. I am someone who learns better when someone is directly in person. I am able to ask questions easier and more efficiently when a teacher is there to answer. Although distance learning can benefit students who learn better this way, there are still students who could use this excuse as a way to stay home and abandon their schoolwork. Students are less likely to be motivated in their academics which will not benefit them in the future.

Students who use distance learning can lose their social skills attained during public and private schools. Students go to school for their education, but there is also a social aspect with peers all around them. Social skills are taught through a student's individual self when placed in a social environment. Social skills can be beneficial to an individual's future because they are needed in almost any career. When students are older, social skills are used to gain a career because an individual must be able to have basic conversations and be social with customers, clients, patients, and other employees. Distance learning can take away social skills since it is also taking away the social aspect of school. Students who are distance learning lose the ability to communicate with unknown peers and solely rely on the internet for learning. School is also a way for students to create long lasting friendships when going to school. If social skills are not learned, it is much harder for students to create friendships. Although some people believe that friendships are not needed in life, but being able to have a friend who can be there to help during hard times can help an individual significantly. When I am struggling, not only with school, but with other personal issues, friends are a very good option to go to. With distance learning, students will lose the opportunity to obtain friendships and could lose their social skills.

Students can lose preparation for college life since college is usually in person and away from home. In today's society, most students who graduate high school will most likely go on to further their education in college. With long distance learning, students will have a harder time being away from home since their educational environment is their own home. If students attend school, they are already used to being in a public or private school environment that has similarities to college life. School prepares students for attending classes, waking up on time, and being able to manage their time. From experience, I would not have been able to learn to do this without school in person. In college, students will have to do the same types of things, but students who distance learn have to get used to the college lifestyle. Students who do public or private schooling already obtained these skills. However, with distance learning, students do not have a structured schedule for what their day will be like. Although some people believe that attending classes from home is more beneficial, students will have a harder time transitioning to college. Since distance learning is very different from how life will be like in college, students will not be as prepared as someone who goes to a public or private school. This means that students can lose the ability to prepare for college life through distance learning.

The cons outweigh the pros for distance learning. Students who choose distance learning will most likely have to struggle more in the future. Students are less likely to be motivated, will lose social skills, and will lose preparation for college life through distance learning which means it will not be beneficial to students. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"This technology will not be needed in classrooms. They wont be needed because a teacher wont change the way they teach just because 1 students isnt happy wih they way they teach. Another reason why they shouldnt have this new technology is just because they probably dont have the money for it. Final reason why they shouldnt get this is because it wont benifit any student. its only going to help with one thing and thats to help the teacher figure out who is bored and who isnt. Schools dont need this.

First reason as to why school should not get this new emotional expression technology is because teachers really wont care what one student thinks. The thing will say that you're bored and that their lesson sucks but teachers really wont care what you think because the rest of the class doesnt think that. They might give you extra help but they wont change the way they are teaching just because 1 student is bored.

Another reason why schools should not get this is because their budget. This will probably be very expensive and schools probably cant afford one for each class. The school should also remember that it will only do one thing and thats read emotion. It wont make any student smarter, it''ll just read their emotional expression and its not very useful. Schools shouldnt spend a ton of money on a machine that will only help with 1 thing.

Finaly reason as to why schools shouldnt get this is because this emotional expression machine isnt going to benifit any student. Its only going to read an emotion and nothing else. It wont make anyone any smarter than they already are and its just a waste of time,money, and space.

Schools should not get this new technology because it wont help anyone but the guy who created it. It'll be fun to mess around with but it wont be useful. There shouldnt even be an argument about this because its actually dumb to think that schools want to but an expensive machine that will not help anyone in any way.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Ever heard of Bill Nye the Science Guy? If you have, please ""Consider the Following"". School doesn't give many people vibes of achievement, goals, or learning. In fact, school is a pretty stressful time for young people and their peers. I've known students who haven't slept in a week and yet still show up for school. With the chaos that might erupt during the hours of education, adding more would not be ideal. Extracurricular activities can be important and fun for some students, yes, but we have to consider every possible situation that could prevent some students from being able to. Students have their own lives out of the seven hours, and adding more could be something that they are not able to keep up with, that could affect their mental health, or could damage future opportunities.

Students already have work they are given to do after school, and they have responsibilities they have to keep up with when they come home. So homework aside, they could still have a lot to do at home. Parents could be working and they have to tend to their younger siblings. They take shifts at a local Starbucks to earn money so they can help with the bills. Or if they're in America, they could be saving up to pay for college applications. They possibly just come home and relax because they had a big exam and are absolutely drained of any and all energy. Whatever the situation is, after school activities could interfere with their personal and/or outside life. And if the extracurricular is during school or on weekends, that's just more valuable time taken from them that could be used for something else. And that could drain them of energy even more. There could be billions of reasons why they just cannot keep up, and we must take that into consideration.

One of the reasons they might not be able to keep up is because life might be bringing them down. Many students across the globe are so sickeningly stressed, and they aren't even two decades into their life. Adults still have dreams about school and get stressed out about them when they are awake, even if they have graduated years ago. And did you know the average high school student has the same anxiety levels as a 1950's psychiatric patient? While the world has developed from the 1950's, that does not make these facts any less terrifying. And adding more can do something to their mental state of mind. Picture it: a stereotypical basketball player, playing after school 'til six. Suddenly everyone's cheering for them, and the pressure gets to them as they struggle to keep grades up, get good scores on exams, get scholarships, and take care of everything. They become tense and irritable and they don't find time to breathe. Forcing extracurricular activities on top of students while already piling homework and tests and competitions, it is bound to make them break. In fact, forcing even things they like can make them lose their interests. If you force them to do something everyday, they will find that it is probably just for the grade instead of the experience, and they could quickly lose interest in something that they adored before.

All this loss of interest can also play a part in damaging the future. Remember when we talked about saving money for college? If they can't earn enough to apply, that's one missed opportunity right there. They could have been the world's next Einstein and we wouldn't ever know. Or because of working after school on the yearbook committee they miss a party that could have been the best night of their life. A memory that could have stuck with them was erased as soon as they signed up for the student council. We will never know how the future plans out but we have to let the students decide for themselves about that. They need to experience what they choose and when they choose to live it.

So as you can see, everyone lives in their own time and their own place and comfort zone. You can't force things on students forever. If it ever comes to go big or go home, when in student's doubt, just let them decide what works for them. Because these extracurricular activities are not always beneficial to the student.

If you enforce them with knowing everything, it effects their mental being, and can affect their lives outside of school and their future as well.                          ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Cars can change the universe

Fellow citizens there should be a limit on car usage . If there's limits with our car usage then we would have a better community, there would be less pollution,less drugs passing through other citizens cars. If there isn't a limit on car usage us citizens would be the ones suffering from chemicals getting into our  lungs from all the pollution our own cars let out, two we would be affecting our community because everyone wouldn't walk anywhere they'd just spend money on gas going to somewhere or visting there friends and family . Better to save the earth, then to damage the earth.

First, why not just have limits on car usage saves our community just by a little step like that. We wouldnt have to worry about just walking down the street and a drunk driver just coming out of no where and hitting us. In source 1, by Elisabeth Rosenthal in interview a mother of two and she said, ""When I had a car I was always tense."" why be tense when you can be stress-free just by not using your cars all the time and having limits on them. If we actually do help our community by having limits on our car usage then we could make cities denser,and healthier community to walk around in.

Second, pollution sucks, these chemicals we're observing are eventually going to hurt us in the long run we are either going to die of the gas our cars are releasing or we're either going to get really sick from it. Who wants to get sick because a stupid decision of driving a car? most definetly not me. These limits are for the best for us citizens . Like source 3, by Andrew Selsky States ,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air .""of course its better to just take a nice walk than to just be lazy and drive a car. Bike rides with friends sound better than a car ride, in a car people usually blast the music and don't communicate with one another, but while you bike ride you can communicate with one another and actually have fun racing eachother on these bike rides healthier than a car ride.

Last, with the limits of car usage smoggling can be prevented because it won't be easy for people from other countries trying to pass by in cars with drugs because the state would have certain transportations they can only use which they might not want to use because it's so public. Source 2 states, last week, Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter(pm) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,his only means someone from another country brought it to Paris and its ended up at London who knows how.

It's better of just having car usage limits to prevent drug passing, also to help our community, and have a healthier earth without pulluting the eart.    ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Most of the time people are given tasks that must be completed or accomplished by a specific time; however, the task given might not be what one truly wants to do which could lead to lazy work or under achieving expectations. Having that sense of freedom to do what you want is what we all strive to have. The willingness to complete the task at hand goes up as well. Ultimate freedom comes in many forms, but summer vacation is the best example of that especially for a student, and by giving them work restricted to a set rules or guidelines is like putting a wild lion in captivity. Summer projects should be designed by the students because at the end of the summer it would of been thought up, made, revised, edited, printed, and turned in by the student so it's only fair to let them have some fun with it too. It's something about being able to be ones own boss that makes work seem less like work.

Freedom is the name of the game and most people really like to participate. This may seem like not a big deal at the time, but to some people just a little slack off the rope is enough for them to run for miles and they will benefit greatly because of it. My mom once said to me, ""a little goes a long way."" Giving a student the opportunity to talk about whatever topic they see best fits is beneficial because, not only will this make them want to do it, but they will also be able use their imagination to complete the project. Personally if a teacher tells me to write an essay on per set terms and topic i'm going to struggle, not want to do it, and not have any type of motivation because the topic is not interesting to me personally; although, if i'm given the chance to do a personal essay then that is when I can what i want and talk about what I want.

Another big thing to consider is if they are willing to do what you ask of them on the rules pre-determined. willingness to do something is night and day and it shows; for example, if ones parent tells then to clean their room they are less willing and will probable not do a good job at it, but if one makes the choice on ones own will being then they will do it at a high success rate. As of now most people, mostly adults, end up doing what they want later in life because its what satisfies them. if one hates their job they are nine times out of 10 going to find another job that suites them and that they enjoy. By giving the students the willingness to do as they please it will relieve stress and hopefully end up with a higher rate of completion

In conclusion freedom, the ability to think for ones self, and taking pride in what we do is what we all want in life, being able to go to sleep feeling happy and accomplished. By giving the student the chance to spread their wings and do as they see best fits for them is beneficial in the long run, especially when it comes to something as important as school grades. Something as simple as the way the student approaches this assignment can and will effect their grade and maybe even their life forever. So next time a summer project is given just let the students have some fun, it is summer vacation after all. ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"For me the best Policy is the first one because they will have it off during classes. Besides there is nothing wrong with calling or texting your friends. I mean what if there is an emergency and you have to use your cell phone to tell you friends that emergency. For example if you and your friends had the some classes but you have it before your friends and there is a pop quiz, you are able to tell your friends during you are walking to you next class.

Sure there might have their cell phones out during class time, then and only then the teacher may take up the cell phones and give it after class. But it will not be far to the students if a teacher takes up their cell phones on the students free time or lunch period, otherwise the teachers will be the one that will be breaking the rules or the policy. If the cell phone is the cause of their tardy then the teacher can take up the cell phone.

"Research has shown that exercising does help you live longer. However what if you were forced to do a sport or something after school that is not a sport? Me personally I disagree, but I am going to talk about my opinions on why right now.

People shouldn't have to do anything after school if they don't want to. Staying after school is a opportunity to have fun and see some of your friends. Therefore if it was forced it would defiantly not be as much fun because you wouldn't want to do it. Nobody should be forced to do something if they don't want to.

There are other things people want or have to do sometimes instead of staying after school everyday. It would take away some of the fun. For instance what if someone wants to go out of town but they can't because they have to stay after school. Additionally people have other things to do outside of school, things like ballet, basketball for someplace else, maybe any sport, etc.. If they did then they would be burned out like a fire in the rain.

Having homework and having to stay after everyday would be terrible. With having to stay after school also comes homework. We at least have one thing to do everyday, sometimes more. With that being said some after school activities last 2:30-4:00 or 2:30-6:30. Homework usually takes 20 minutes tops depending on what it is, but when you have 2 or 3 things to do you can't go to bed until late. Also studying can be hard with an after school activity because that really takes a long time. Additionally, you still have to shower and do things to prepare for the next day which makes you go to bed even later when you have to wake up at 5:30-6:30AM. Only that is whole different subject for a while different time.

Staying after school is fun but if you were forced it would change everything. People stay after because they want to, not because they are forced too. It would defiantly not be fair if people were forced too. That is my opinion on this question.",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I honesly think that we should all get out there and help other people in need. And I think that every single person should have to do it. Everybody in this world can always use a little bit of help.

If there is one or two people that do not agree with this, then maybe they are just a little to selfish.

Because I'm sure if next time they need help, and someone goes "" Oh, sorry I don't have time."" or "" Sorry, I just have to much to do right now."" They wouldn't be to happy. Everybody can get out there and help one another out.

If this world didn't take time for other people it would be a complete mess.

Even if you took a couple minutes out of your day to go out and pick up trash, or help the elderly person that lives beside you. Or help out at the animal shelter. Just for a couple hours, or not even that a day would show people that you are willing to help when they did help the most.

People that go to Elementary schools and help with little kids and help them understand more of what they are learning or even teach them new things can always be used. Specially when people reach out a hand to help a child or person that is disabled or maybe is just a slower learner. Sometimes, people don't know how much just a simple little thing can mean to someone.

Walking a dog for someone that is to old or can't stand to walk that long is always helpful. Or even mowing the lawn for someone that can't or has health issues, and can't get out there and do it themselves. All of these things can always help. And plus, it's nice to know that when you need help, you can find it. I think that every single person should get out there and give a helping hand. Every single person has had someones help, someone that was willing to take the time and reach out a helping hand and help them. So we can always give it back. Even some of the smallest things matter the most.

Sincerely,

"All teachers fear the inevitable ""summer slide"" that comes during summer break. In order to combat this trend, many schools are starting to assign summer projects to students in order to help them retain information and further their education. However, many people disagree on whether the projects should be designed by the teachers or the students themselves. Some say that students would be able to effectively pursue their own interests while others say teachers' experience would prove to be more effective. Summer projects should be designed by the teachers because of their previous experience in designing projects, their ability to ensure critical information will be retained or learned, and their ability to ensure that all students will receive the same amount of work.

A common argument for students to design their own projects would be that by allowing students this freedom, students would be able to actively pursue the topics and ideas that interest them and this would drive them to work more enthusiastically on their projects. Just as Frederick Douglass fervently pursued his dream of learning to read, these students would also be self motivated to learn about their own interests. However this is incorrect because teachers can design the projects to include all students' interests but do so in a more effective way. Teachers develop a personal bond with students throughout the year. This bond that develops informs the teachers on the students' skills and interests which would allow the teachers to develop the summer projects in such a way as to facilitate eager emotions for learning. This way, the students would still be inspired by their interests to learn while being guided by their teacher to learn everything that they should.

Teachers have valuable experience from their work that allows them to be skilled at designing summer projects. All high school teachers have a collegiate level of education as required by their job. The teachers have years of experience studying the best ways to facilitate learning through all mediums, including projects. Due to this large gap in understanding the intricacies of learning, teachers are extremely more skilled at designing projects than students. In addition, because the projects are meant to facilitate learning and recall, the teachers' understanding of how learning is best achieved allows them insight to the most efficient ways to do this. It is a common saying among athletes that ""practice makes perfect."" This principle can also be applied to other skills such as designing projects. Teachers, through their years of work and experience, have created multitudes of projects. Their experience of creating projects allows them to master the craft to produce quality material. While students have little to no experience creating projects, teachers do. Their superiority in this way allows them to more effectively combat the ""summer slide"" than the students would. Though experience is important, essential information also plays a large role.

Teachers can make sure that essential skills and knowledge will be retained by students to ensure future success. Teachers are required by their school to be familiar with the course and curriculum that they teach. With this knowledge, teachers can implement the essential material into the projects. By doing this, the students remember and learn vital information without even realizing it. Teachers can equip students with knowledge that will prove to be vital later on in their schooling careers. If students designed their own projects, this extra benefit would not be at all possible because of their obvious lack of knowledge that they have yet to learn. One essential skill that is taught by professors to retain information for long periods of time is to review what you have already learned. This memory skill can be hidden within projects by the teachers to cement certain information into students brains. Teachers would be able to strengthen old knowledge while providing new knowledge and skills through their projects. Though knowledge is important, equal opportunity is as well.

Teaches would ensure that all students are given the same amount of work to complete for their projects. Steve Jobs said that he always gave the hardest jobs to the laziest people. Students, like everyone else, have a tendency to be lazy. If students were allowed to design their own projects, many would do the bare minimum to get it out of the way. By allowing teachers to design the projects, this would be mitigated and ensure all students worked hard. The College Board works to ensure that all students are treated equal during standardized tests. If Colleges give everyone equal work and opportunity, it only makes sense for all other levels of school to do this as well. Through teacher designed projects, teachers could ensure that everyone is on an equal playing field. By doing this teachers would not allow students to unknowingly disenfranchise themselves of necessary skills. This way all students will be equal ready in their college readiness. All students would equally benefit from the teacher assigned projects.

Though students may enjoy designing their own projects, teacher-designed projects would provide greater benefit to all students. Through the teachers' intellectual maturity and experience they would provide better practice with the purpose and skills within the projects. Their knowledge of whats to come would also provide students with solid foundations for the upcoming school year, starting them off on the right foot. Teachers ability to provide equal opportunity for all students would ensure future success by ensuring proper habits are formed. Teachers, not students, should design summer projects to combat the summer slide because of their acquired skills in teaching, their insight to the students' futures, and how they can instill success equally to their students.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Ralph Waldo Emerson was a writer, philosopher and key figure of the Transcendentalist movement of the 19th century. He believed that life should be looked at positively as an adventure and encouraged individuals to explore and discover the world around them. He wrote extensively about his philosophy, often drawing parallels between nature and the beauty of the human experience. His famous quote that ""Life is an adventure - sail out on the sea of life"" encapsulates his understanding that life should be embraced in all its beauty and complexity. I agree with Emerson that life is an amazing and rewarding journey and that everyone should strive to appreciate it fully. By embracing the unknown and exploring the experiences that life has to offer, we can enrich our lives and find new paths to pursue. Life is a journey and it is our responsibility to make the most of it.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Dear principle,

I think that students should not be able to use or have phones present during the school day. It is something that kids shouldn't worry about during the school day. phones should only be used in schools in the event of an emergency. Cell phones may cause problems in times that the student is working and will prevent he or she from completing their work.

Their is always the argument that cell phones may help students get rid of stress by talking to someone when no others can hear. That they could talk to friends that across the school or to another school. This could a chance for them to hang out with a friend that they cant see during the school day.

This could also have many down sides. This could lead to a increased risk of having cell phones away for saying stuff that is not needed or allowed to be said in school. This would increase the risk of student getting ISS, OSS, or even kicked out of school for not needed behavior. It could also lead to fights. Even cell phone theft or misplacement of a cell phone.

I hope that you will take what I have said into consideration. The school will stay a more friendly place to be. Their will be no unnecessary disruptions. The kids will be better off with no cell phones allowed to be used in the school building.

"As an 8th grader, I have learned about the many contributions of people in the past who have shaped society in significant ways. One example that stands out to me is the inventions of the Industrial Revolution.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, people like Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell revolutionized the way goods were produced and transported. They invented machines like the steam engine and the telephone, which greatly increased efficiency and productivity. These inventions allowed for the mass production of goods, leading to a significant increase in the standard of living for many people. Without the inventions of the Industrial Revolution, it's likely that society would be much different today.

However, I also understand that inactivity can have a negative impact on society. For example, if people in the past had been inactive and not contributed to society, we may not have the same level of technological advancements that we do today. This could have led to a slower pace of progress and a lower standard of living for many people.

In the present, it's important for people to continue to contribute to society in order to shape a better future for the generations to come. This can be done through innovation and hard work, as well as by staying informed and engaged in current events. By staying active and involved, we can ensure that society continues to progress and improve.

One way that people can contribute to society is by pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). These fields are crucial for driving innovation and advancing technology, and there is currently a high demand for skilled professionals in these areas. By pursuing a career in STEM, individuals can make a significant impact on society and help shape the future.

Another way to contribute to society is through volunteer work and community service. By giving back to the community and helping those in need, individuals can make a positive impact on society and create a better world for everyone.

In conclusion, people in the past have made significant contributions to society through their inventions and innovations. However, inactivity can also have a negative impact on society. In the present, it's important for people to continue to contribute to society through innovation, hard work, and community service in order to shape a better future for the generations",1,llama2_chat,4
"Driverless cars should be developed and used. There are many ways that driverless cars could help us. Safety is a main concern but many accidents occur due to the driver being disctracted or someone else's fault.

Driverless cars will have sensors to stay on a certain course and not get off track. The sensors could also detect if something is too risky such as backing up in a parking lot. When a time like that occurs the driver must drive the car until the car can handle the situation.

Many accidents occur due people using a celluar device and losing track of where they are. In a driverless car this could be prevented because the driver is not driving the vehicle. They could use their phones but they must know when the car cannot be piloted in a sticky situation. A driverless car could also be used as a taxi driver for those that drink and drive. Driverless cars can also help semi truck drivers that drive around for hours and hours.

Advanced computer systems could be put in the driverless cars to prevent enviromental issues on the road. The systems could also prevent possible rollovers and sliding off the road. It will be very costly but we can save many lives and prevent many accidents from occuring.

So driverless cars can prevent many accidents and they could help many people in making their job a whole lot easier. It will be costly but it will be worth all the lives that can be saved and helped. ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Detecting Emotions

New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valuable, or it could be a waste of time, depending on how you look at it.

Technology has been upgraded throughout recent decades, and most recently, technology has taken a different approach. The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate, but is this really a better way to communicate? It comes down to the facts. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Everyone has different ways of expressing emotions, and not everyone feels the same emotions. Thinking that a computer could possibly detect your emotions is a bit silly, to some, and valuable to others. So what makes it silly to some? You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face, you can talk with them in person. Having physical contact is very important when it comes to emotions, using a computer to detect, sounds a bit far-fetched. Schools have teachers, and school counselors, so that students can talk express how they feel. Some people don't see why this feature could possibly be useful in a classroom.

There are many issues going on in the world, much worse than trying to figure our expressions. So, why aren't we using this tchnology, and these smart people to work on something more important? Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, what would you need it for? Human communication is very important, using a computer to detect how you feel is simply a waste of time, in some opinions. Making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotion. On the other hand, what could the Facial Action Coding System be useful for in classrooms? Students may be able to use this feature in physiciatry studies. Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling. However, a computer cannot feel, cannot have sympathy, and cannot understand many things about humans. Reaching the final conclusion is up to you. Is a computer being able to identify your emotions useful in classrooms, or not? ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"In today's digital age, cellphones have become an integral part of our daily lives. They are no longer just devices used for communication and entertainment, but also for education. Allowing students to use their cellphones in classrooms for educational purposes has numerous positive effects on their academic performance and overall learning experience.

One of the most significant benefits of allowing cellphones in classrooms is that they can help students finish their assignments. With the availability of various apps and online tools, students can easily access educational resources and complete their tasks more efficiently. For example, they can use note-taking apps to jot down important information, language learning apps to improve their grammar and vocabulary, and math apps to practice problems. Additionally, cellphones can also serve as a distraction-free study environment, allowing students to focus solely on their work without any external distractions.

Another advantage of allowing cellphones in classrooms is that they can help students check their grades and assignments. Many schools have online portals where students can access their grades, assignments, and other important information. By using their cellphones, students can easily check their progress and make any necessary adjustments to their work. This can help students feel more in control of their academic performance and reduce stress and anxiety related to schoolwork.

Furthermore, cellphones can also help students learn better. With the availability of educational apps and online resources, students can access a wide range of learning materials and engage in interactive activities that promote active learning. For example, they can use educational games to practice math and science concepts, watch educational videos to learn about different subjects, and participate in online discussions to develop critical thinking and communication skills. Additionally, cellphones can also help students collaborate with their peers and teachers, allowing them to work together on projects and assignments.

Finally, allowing cellphones in classrooms can help students have a better understanding of their work and feel more comfortable learning. By using their cellphones, students can easily access educational resources and ask questions to clarify any doubts or misunderstandings. This can help students feel more confident in their learning and reduce the fear of failure. Moreover, cellphones can also help students feel more connected to their learning community, as they can communicate with their teachers and peers and share their ideas and insights.

In conclusion, allowing students to use their cellphones in classrooms for educational purposes has numerous positive effects on their",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Suppose a community free from clutter and a safe haven for all the residents that live there. I think that community service should be necessary for all students to do. I think this because community service helps improve the community's look. Also, many people can benefit from students doing community service. Lastly, doing community service helps to promote a student a healthy lifestyle for years to come.

First, community service helps improve a community's overall look. Picking up trash from places, unobservant individuals might drop them, is a praiseworthy way to make the area not look dirty. Signs should also be put up that says, ""No Littering."" Also, I suggest attaching a fine so people won't be tempted to do it again. Clearing up storm drains helps make it so when it rains the water will be able to flow freely, instead of it being clogged up.

Second, many people can benefit from students participating in community service. Students that go to nursing homes, and going to the senior citizens to greet them and sing to them will truly warm their hearts. Doing this gives the senior citizens happiness, helping local medical facilities would also be a creditable way to help the community, helping in a blood drive for example would mean someone who needed blood would be given it.

Third, doing community service helps to promote a students a healthy lifestyle for years to come. Instead, of staying home watching television or playing video games all day. Students can become active in their life. This would also prevent obesity because getting out there and helping the community would mean a good exercise.

In Summation, I think making community service required for all students to do is a good idea because community service helps improve the community's look. Also, many people can benefit from students doing community service. Lastly, doing community service helps promote a student a healthy lifestyle for years to come. The school and the community would be indebted to the students that did this.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"What would I say if I were a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, when I don't? I would first off say they're are no such things as aliens. There is no evidence that aliens are real. The only evidence we have are pictures that people send in of ""UFOs"" or ""aliens"" being spotted. Seriously those pictures could be easily edited with the power of the internet.

The Face is just a natural landform! The Face, like many other landforms, looks (hince the name) like a face! Have you ever past by a hill, rock, or any other landform that kind of looks like a human or any other human part? If you have than you know what I'm talking about. Sometimes you start thinking ""why does it look ike that?"" or ""what if someone's body is buried there?"".

Although the Face looks like a face, it may have not been built by aliens. Like NASA said when they unveiled the image for everyone to see, it's just a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."". The Face was just formed by shadows and your eyes playing a little trick on you.

We don't have enough evidence to prove that aliens created this, so it's much better if we stick to my idea. It's all the work of your eyes, shadows, and the form of the rock. If only we could go to Mars and figure out the truth. ",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Hey, so I'm gonna write this essay about cellphones in the classroom. I think it's a pretty cool topic, right? I mean, we all use our phones all the time, so it's pretty relevant to us. Okay, so here are some pros and cons of letting us use our phones in class.

So, the pros are pretty obvious. We can use our phones to look up stuff for our projects and stuff. Like, if we're doing a report on a historical event, we can just Google it and get all the information we need right away. It's way faster than looking through books or something. And we can also use our phones to take pictures or videos of stuff we're learning about, like if we're doing a science experiment or something. That way, we can see it again later and remember it better.

But, there are also some cons. Like, sometimes we get distracted and start playing games or something instead of paying attention to the lesson. And that's not cool. We have to be careful and make sure we're only using our phones for educational stuff, not just wasting time. And also, sometimes the teacher might not want us to use our phones because they want us to focus on the lesson and not get distracted.

Another thing is that sometimes the phone signal is bad in our school, so we might not be able to get on the internet or anything. That's pretty frustrating, especially if we're trying to look up something really important. But, I guess that's just something we have to deal with sometimes.

So, overall, I think it's pretty cool that we can use our phones in class. It makes things way easier and faster, but we have to be responsible and make sure we're not getting distracted. And the teacher has to be okay with it too, or else it's not gonna work out.

That's my essay! I hope you like it! Let me know if you have any questions or if you want me to change anything. 😃",1,llama2_chat,0
"The Electoral College is a process made by the founding fathers for the election of presidents by the Congress's vote. The Electoral College is a process, but it is an unfair process. Americans are supposed to vote for who they desire to be president, not a group of electors in Congress. There is no possible way for Americans to choose their president if at the end of it all, a group of electors make the final choice. According to the Office of the Federal Register, Americans choose the state electors when voting for President because when voting for president, Americans are actually voting for the candidate's electors. It makes no sense then to vote for a president, let's just make it to where we vote for electors because we obviously aren't voting for who we want as president.

The main purpose of voting is to help the candidate American voters want as president to win the election. If popular vote was the way to determine who would be elected as President, everybody would be happy. There are times in an election when everybody is sure that the candidate they voted for is going to win. Americans watch as they see the votes go up by popular vote, but then later, the candidate they thought would win has lost because of the Electoral College. If popular vote was the way Presidents were elected, everything would be made easier without controversy. However, since the Electoral College does play a big role in the election of presidents, popular vote is never going to be a working system. Americans just need to figure out that their vote is never going to really count, but the Electoral College's vote surely will.

In an article by Bradford Plumer, the fact that over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than how we vote now is stated. The Electoral College System is based on Americans voting for the electors that are the candidate's party. When Americans go to vote, they vote for electors who support the President and then the electors choose the president. When Americans go to vote, the banners should just say Vote For Electors. When Americans vote, it is made to seem as they are voting directly for the President they want to be elected. Instead, Americans are actually voting for electors. Multiple times you'll hear the saying, ""Every vote counts."" but really, every vote does not count. No matter how many times Americans vote for their President, the Electoral College has the final say no matter what American's votes are.

The major problem that worries many, is the problem of a tie in the electoral vote. During an election when a tie occurs, the state delegations vote for who will be president. According to the article The Indefensible Electoral College by Bradford Plumer, each state is able to cast one vote and the one single state representative makes the decision for the state. If the point of an election is for the people to vote and choose, there shouldn't even be a option for the one representative to choose. All the votes that were just cast by Americans all go down the drain now. In the case of a tie, all the power and weight goes to the one state representative to choose who becomes the president. The represtative does not care about what the people want, that representative will choose what they want to do with this election. According to Bradford Plummer, during the 2000 campaign, Rhode Island, South Carolina and fifteen other states did not even get to view media markets or campaigns and did not even get to see the candidates. Those states howeve still voted, not knowing anything about these candidates because overall the Electoral College makes the last call.

The Electoral College is an unfair process that also plays a big role in elections. No matter how Americans vote, the Electoral College is going to be the people who elect the president. Americans vote for who they want as their president but the Electoral College simply makes that decision for you. Americans shouldn't even vote, the Electoral College can make that decision. Many people in America simply want the popular vote than to have the process of Electoral College in place. We should all take a vote to abolish the Electoral College. But wait, the Electoral College might say no since they always make the overall decision.            ",0,persuade_corpus,3

First , seeking opinions can impact lots of people , they can get tips on what they should do too solve the situation . Also getting advise can help alot of problems , when people , friends , and family ask for advise sometimes they dont know what to do or say . Also soon as you give the person advise they would feel less sad and worried .

Second , people also ask other people just to make sure they've got the best advise . Sometimes people get advise and dont apply it to themselvles . Also some people are good at giving advise but dont ask for any that's why you should'nt just get one person to give you there opinion .

Lastly , seeking advise from all of your friends is the best thing to do just to know what they would do if they were in your shoes . Friends all together gives the best advise because not only are they helping you in the sitiuation they are all helping eachother .

"Extracurricular activities should be mandatory because kids could look forward to activities after school instead of going home and sitting around for hours. It would help kids stay out of trouble, keep students active, and help students build a social life.

Making students stay after school would help them stay out of trouble. Most students parents have and office job. The average work time is from 9am to 5pm, and school gets out at around 2pm- 4pm, so most kids are left unsupervised for around 2-6 hours. Kids left alone can get into all sorts of trouble and can be persuaded to do things that they know they should not do. Kids can be convinced to do drugs, join gangs, and vandalize public property. Instead of doing these things they can be supervised at school doing something that is fun and enjoyable instead of being mischievous. The school environment would be much safer because students wouldnt be influenced be other people to do any bad things, so they would not be doing or selling drugs and they would not be in or associated with a gang. Therefore, students would not bring in bad things into our schools. Making students stay after school would help them stay out of trouble, and stay good people.

The second reason that students should have to participate in an after school activities is because it is a way to get kids out of the house and encourage them to do something with their lives. Some kids go home and play sports outside or play a game with their siblings, but most kids go home and play video games for 5 hours till they have to eat dinner or go to bed. This is very unhealthy. An extracurricular activity would get a person who usually plays lots of video games to do something active. They could play sports after school and they would still have time for video games. Playing sports after school could convince them to play sports for fun, not because they have to do something after school and they could join a league and exercise more than just after school. This would help kids stay active and healthy. After school activities for all people is a good idea because it would help kids stay active and healthy.

Finally, making kids stay after school would help students build a social life. During the school day some kids do not socialize with others because they are tired, shy, or they are very focused on academics. After school, activities would really help kids gain a social life. After school activities are laid back and are made too do something active after school, not to secretly trick kids into too staying an extra hour after school. The activities after school are fun, they are meant to be. Kids after school who are shy can communicate with others because the activities give them ways to start of conversations and communicate with others.

In conclusion, Extracurricular activities should be mandatory. This would help kids stay out of trouble because it would keep them doing something healthy instead of something mischievous. It would students kids stay healthy because it would force them to do something active. and finally, it would help students because it would help students gain a social life because they could communicate with others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to tell u that kids should bring there phones to school because u never know when there's going to be a emergency. but they shouldn't because it is going to be a distraction to them when they are in class. I don't really have a opinion to it because in both cases there is a good thing about it and a problem to it.

For example what happens if a kid parent had a problem at work and he cant pick him up when school is over how is the dad going to tell his son that he has a problem and that he is not going to pick him up. or maybe that the boy had to stay after school for a program or serve detention how is he going to tell his father that he is going to stay and the father is going to get mad at him because he didn't inform him about what was going to happen after school.

On the other hand having it is going to be a distraction as i said before because many other kids are not going to pay attention. They are going to be on the phone while the teacher was giving the lesson for that day. Not all the kids do that they may find a excuse so that they could message while they where out of class and the teacher thinking that he/she went to the restroom or to pick up something from another class.

As u see there is going to be a problem picking witch one is ok for the school and many are going to agree or disagree. i couldn't pick one as u see but i gave u two reasons why it is good and why it's bad for us students. i know it is going to be a tough desition but your going to be ok with it.

"As an 8th grader, I have noticed that technology has become a huge part of our daily lives. From smartphones to laptops, and from social media to video games, technology is everywhere. While technology has made many things easier and more convenient, it also has its downsides. In this essay, I will discuss the negative and positive impacts of technology on people, the consequences of a lack of communication due to technology, and the ways in which children can become overly obsessed with technology.

One of the negative impacts of technology is that it can have a detrimental effect on people's mental and physical health. For example, excessive use of smartphones and social media can lead to addiction, anxiety, and depression. Moreover, sitting in front of screens for long periods of time can cause eye strain, headaches, and poor posture. On the other hand, technology can also have positive impacts on people's health. For instance, telemedicine and virtual consultations can make healthcare more accessible and convenient, especially for people living in remote areas.

Another consequence of a lack of communication due to technology is social isolation. While technology can connect people from all over the world, it can also lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions. This can result in feelings of loneliness, disconnection, and isolation. Moreover, technology can also make it easier for people to spread false information and propaganda, which can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. However, technology can also facilitate communication and collaboration, making it easier for people to work together and share ideas.

Children are particularly susceptible to becoming overly obsessed with technology. They spend hours playing video games, scrolling through social media, and watching videos, which can lead to a lack of physical activity, poor sleep habits, and a decrease in creativity. Moreover, excessive screen time can also affect children's mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems. However, technology can also be a valuable tool for children's education, providing them with access to a wealth of information and educational resources.

In addition, technology has greatly improved work schedules and shopping experiences. With the rise of e-commerce, people can now shop from the comfort of their own homes, without having",1,llama2_chat,0
"Character traits are essential tools in determining who we are and how we interact with the world around us. Whether we are consciously choosing our characteristics or they have been molded by our environment, our traits have the potential to profoundly shape our lives.

When individuals take on the task of examining their traits and actively choosing which ones to foster or abandon, they are engaging in the practice of self-development. Being aware and mindful of the qualities that define us and the consequences they may have, allows us to take control of our lives and create our own destiny. These actions can lead to greater autonomy, happiness, and satisfaction with our decisions, as we are empowering ourselves instead of allowing ourselves to be a product of external forces.

On the other hand, when character traits are acquired due to outside circumstances, we are left in a vulnerable state, as we are not in control of the messages conveyed by our traits. Depending on our upbringing, peer group, or societal norms, the traits that form us can be limiting and inhibit us from reaching our desired goals. If we do not question and challenge what has been instilled in us, we may become victim to our own preconceived beliefs and succumb to our environment’s restrictions.

Therefore, it is important for us to become mindful of our character traits, as they play an integral role in determining the direction of our lives. Self-development and intentional self-growth can grant us the freedom to pursue our passions and find fulfillment in our lives.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"It would be in our advantage to use cars less,simply because there not good for the enviroment.

If we as human beings keep relying on cars as much as we do the world will be in bad shape

US as people have to treat the earth better because this is our home ,this is were we have to live and many generations after us have live .

The number of miles driven per person in america has definetly decreased over the years, the recession had a lot to do with that. With that being saidmany measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is underway. The rates of car ownership in america has also decresed. Maybe that means something more fundamental is going on.

By us using cars as much as we do pullution starts to happen. One of the biggest pollutes cars cause is smog.

smog is like fog but it contains gases and if we keep relying on cars as much as we do the world wont be a safe place for us to live. Smog got so bad in france that they had to stop people from drivng.

Maybe we should be more like vauban,germany and have less cars, '' when i had a car i was always tense, but im much happier without a car '' says heidrun walter . Vauban completed in 2006,is a growing trend in europe,the united states and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a compnent of a movement called '' smart planning ''

One if president obamas goals is to curve greenhouse gas emmissions, and i support that fully. studys sho that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as earch year goes by. This makes me question wether or not america hass passed peak driving. if this behavior persists the socioligists believe that we will have beneficial  implications for carbon emmisions and the enviroment,sense transportation is the second largest source of americas emmisions.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Starting a career at a young age can be a great opportunity for some, but it can also have its drawbacks. When I think about starting a career early in life, I think about how it can be both beneficial and harmful.

On one hand, starting a career early can give you a head start in life. You can learn new skills and gain experience that can help you in the long run. For example, if you start a career in a field you're passionate about, you can learn the ins and outs of the industry and make connections that can help you advance in your career. Plus, you can earn money and gain financial independence, which can be really helpful.

On the other hand, starting a career early can also have its drawbacks. For one, you might have to quit school to pursue your career full-time, which can be bad for your education. You might miss out on important learning experiences and lose the opportunity to make new friends and connections. Plus, starting a career early can be really stressful and can take a toll on your mental health.

I know some students who took a career class in middle school and they really enjoyed it. They learned about different careers and what it takes to succeed in each one. They also got to do hands-on activities and projects that helped them learn more about their chosen career. But, some of them had to quit school to pursue their career full-time, which was hard for them. They missed out on important learning experiences and lost the opportunity to make new friends and connections.

So, what are the best practices for students considering starting a career early? First, they should think carefully about their career goals and what they want to achieve. They should also consider the potential drawbacks and make sure they're ready for the challenges that come with starting a career early. It's also important to have a backup plan, just in case things don't go as planned.

In conclusion, starting a career at a young age can be both beneficial and harmful. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons and make sure you're ready for the challenges that come with starting a career early. By following best practices and",1,llama2_chat,3
"There is much evidence to show that the Face is a natural landform created by natural causes. In paragraph seven, it is stated that with higher quality the picture revealed the natural landform. Critics assume the landform is alien made due to the pictures taken in 1976. However, as technology evolved over the span of twenty five years, the landmark was found once again and revealed the Face. ''As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'' said Jim Gavin. Gavin then compared the landform on Mars to other landforms such as the butte or mesa around the American West. Gavin also stated that a landform similar to the one on Mars was in Idaho, called the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Scientists also ruled out the possibility of an extrasteral force creating the landform. The Face was first thought to be another Martian mesa. A Martian mesa is common around the area of Cydonia. With taking these factors into consideration, the landform was simply created by natural causes over the millions of years. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Hey there!  So, I guess I'm gonna write about how important outdoor activities are and how they can be fun, ya know? 

First of all, let's talk about why outdoor activities are important.  Like, they help us stay active and healthy, right?! It's not like we can just sit around all day playing video games or something . Outdoor activities like hiking, biking, or even just playing frisbee with friends can get our hearts pumping and our muscles moving. And that's good for us, duh! 

But that's not all!  Outdoor activities can also help us connect with nature.  Like, have you ever seen a sunset and been like, ""Woah, this is so cool!"" or something?! It's like, nature is just so... natural . And when we're outside, we can feel that connection to the earth and everything around us. It's like, we're not just stuck in our own little worlds, you know? 

And let's not forget about the fun part!  Outdoor activities can be super enjoyable!  Like, have you ever gone camping and sat by a campfire, telling ghost stories with your friends?! Or maybe you've gone to the beach and played volleyball with your family?!  It's like, there's nothing better than being outside and doing something you love with the people you love. 

So yeah, outdoor activities are pretty important and they can be super fun too!  Like, we should totally go on a hike or something this weekend!  What do you say?! 

Oh, and I almost forgot!  Outdoor activities can also help us learn new things!  Like, did you know that you can learn about different types of plants and animals when you're outside?! *",1,llama2_chat,1
"These are some good reasons why it is good to ask people for some advice! It is good to ask people their own advice because you can listen and hear from differnt point of views.

When you have other peoples point of view,you get a bigger picture of what you're doing and how do to it.

You get more of an understanding and a bigger and wider verity of choices to choose from.

People ask more than one person advice so they can understand it more and not only use their on own ideas but also listen to what other people have on their mind.

Its good to ask people what their idea is because sometimes your idea doesn't always work and you need a backup if it doesn't, you may also find it helpful to go online and search differnt type of ideas from around the world.

You can also find it helpfulto ask your parents,teachers,friends, and maybe some people you may not know.

Before you think of starting anything the best thing to do is ask questions,you can get alot more information out of it then you think. Plus other people may do the same and get lot of resources to choose from. It is possible to use your own ways of thinking,but after you ask for advice you need to plan out what and how you're gonna do with the information that you have gathered together. You may also want to do a rough draft or write on a piece paper before you ask for any advice,it may give you a better headstart then jumping straight to it and asking questions.

You could also make one of those Diagram so you can compare and see whats differnt from the advice that you have so you can see if its alot better. You have to ask yourself questions like, ""Does it make sense?,"" ""Does it have an meaning?,"" ""Does it have an main idea to it?,"" and ""Does it talk about what im typing/writing about?,""those are some simple questions you can always ask yourself before you start typing/writing. It is more simple then brain storming your own idea and trying to figure out alot of stuff by yourself,that'll take alot of time and it'll be more frustrating then usual,but all you have to do is ask a close by friend or family member what their idea on something would be. After you get all of your information and details about what you wanna type/write about to get now easily put it down on whatever paper or computer you're using at the moment,you will get it done faster,more neat,and more detailed then you would have if you wouldve thought of an idea by yourself. You can still make ideas by yourself but asking for advice would be alot more easy then you think!        ",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Many students find it hard to wake up in the morning and get themselves to school. Finding the motivation to get out of your bed can always be challenging. Knowing that you get to stay in your own home would help a lot. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would be more comfortable, be able to work at their own pace, and feel less anxious.

Physically being at school can be very uncomfortable. Getting to be at home would help students find comfort because they know where the most comfortable spots in their house are. After sitting in the same spot for an hour and half, many people need to change position or sit in a better chair. Very few schools have comfortable seating. Only being able to think about how uncomfortable you are makes it difficult to focus on your work. Being at home, you can sit wherever you want and move around as you please. In a school building, you don't have the freedom to do this all the time. Students would feel a lot better doing their work if they got to be in the comfort of their own home.

Nobody likes to be rushed, it can be very stressful. When I know I am being rushed, I tend to break down and get extremely overwhelmed. Many other students can relate to this feeling. Some classes work too fast or slow for students. It would benefit students a lot if they were attending classes at home because they would be able to work at their own pace. Whether they work fast or slow, it wouldn't impact any of the other students. This would take a lot of stress away because then students wouldn't have to worry about their teacher and other classmates, they could focus on only their work. Knowing they can take their time would reduce a lot of stress.

There are so many students that suffer from anxiety. A lot of kids have their worst moments with anxiety at school. Whether they get anxiety from the work, students, or other things, it is something that makes it so hard for kids to go to school. Being able to attend your class from home would help students who deal with anxiety so much. Most people think of their home as a safe place, but many students do not think of school as a safe place. Having to go to a place you don't find safe, and then being expected to complete your work is be one of the hardest things you can experience. Students would be a lot more willing and able to do their school work if they were in their homes.

So many students would love to attend classes from home. There are so many things that the world doesn't see when it comes to school. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would be more comfortable, be able to work at their own pace, and feel less anxious. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Living a life of joy and satisfaction can provide us with a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment. Too often, we are focused on conforming to what is expected of us or what feels easiest in the moment, instead of what will bring us lasting happiness. Pursuing activities that make us happy, regardless of what those activities may be, can be a liberating and beneficial process. 

For instance, being creative can stimulate our minds in ways that may help us face hardships in life while also providing us with a unique outlet for personal growth. Social activities can help us build relationships with others that bring us joy. Physical activities can reduce stress and help us stay in shape, which can contribute towards overall well-being. In addition, interests such as gardening, art, music, and travel, can help us get in touch with our true selves and appreciate life's simple pleasures.

Ultimately, pursuing activities that make us happy can lead to a more positive outlook in life, as well as a deeper understanding of our own desires and capabilities. Everyone's ability to find joy and purpose in life is individual and unique, and the key is to make sure that we are actively engaging in activities that bring us both happiness and fulfillment.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Schools make summer projects for students to continue their learning, but they can't decide whether they want it to be student-designed or teacher-designed. Student-designed projects would be more beneficial because students would be able to research their interest. Students would be able to use this summer project as a opportunity to find their passions and do some research about them. People might prefer a teacher-designed project, but I believe that student-designed projects would be much more efficient and helpful to students.

A student-designed project is a great idea because it would benefit the students more than teacher-designed one. This project would have students choose their own topic and do some research on said topic. Students would be given the opportunity to explore their interest, unlike with most projects. Students could use a internship or a presentation about their research to show their progress. Students who do an internship would have to present about their experience and prove that they actually did it. At the end of summer, students would present to one of their classes how they documented their experiences and what they learned from this project.

One of the biggest reasons why I think that a student-designed project would be a great idea is that it lets students find their interest. Teens in high school try to find what they are good by participating in extracurricular activities after school. A student-designed project would be the perfect opportunity to find interests. Students would be given some time before school ends to think about the topic they want to research. Summer would be used to research their topic and document their experience. This project could help students get an idea of what they want to study in college thanks to this Student-designed project, which allows students to find their interest/passions and research them. This kind of project has the possibility to help a lot of students find their passion or at least figure out their options.

People wouldn't like the idea of a student-designed project because students can't consult or get help from a teacher if they run into a problem. I believe that this wouldn't be the case because the whole reason behind a student-designed project is that every project will be different and unique to that student. Students wouldn't need help because the project would be about them, unlike a teacher-designed one.

the beauty of a student-designed project would be the originality of each one of the projects that is the reason why students don't need help on this kind of project, other than directions for it. A teacher-designed project doesn't really help a student at all because its just another project they have to do to keep their grades up.

In conclusion, a summer project would be best if it was a student-designed one. A student-designed project allows student to find their interests/passions and allows them to explore different interests. People might prefer a teacher-designed project, but I believe that student-designed projects would be much more efficient and helpful to students. A student-designed project is unique to every student and I believe it can impact a student career's choice.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Not every student has the time for extracurricular activity classes. If the principle dose decides to have students do extracurricular activity classes then it should not be counted as a grade. I think this because most students have other classes, grades, and homework to worry about. If the principal require a extracurricular activity classes then students might become stressed.

First, students already have a choice in which related art class they want to take. Even though it is a choice it is still marked as a grade. Related art classes is like a break from class. If the principal requires you extracurricular activity classes then thats taking time from students learning.

Second, feel like students would not have enough learning time in school if extracurricular activity classes gets added to our school hours. Then it might be too much pressure on students and that can effects a students learning. Teachers need time to teach and students need the time to process what they are learning. Some students need more class time to do work therefore extracurricular activity classes might not be the best choice.

Lastly, some students might not be interested in taking extracurricular activity classes. Students might not be interested because they might not have the time for it. Most students will not try in something they are not interested in and some students are not interested. If teachers count this class as a grade then grades might go down because how many classes is taken in a day.

In conclusion, I think all students should have a choice to take extracurricular activityclasses. Not all students have the time or interest to take the class. Will you make your students take this class if you were a principle. ",0,persuade_corpus,0

"Imagine being able to travel the world and discover true passions while still being able to attend class. While exploring and finding a career, an education is still benefiting the future of the student. This option for pupils is becoming more popular for youth, it is distance learning. Distance learning allows for students to stay home or to explore the world while receiving an education. These pupils can choose classes that interest them and can easily complete them online. Although others may believe having classes at school should be the only option so students can improve social skills, distance learning is the best option because it allows students to travel, go at their own pace, and not have to worry about transportation to attend class.

To begin with, young adults are discovering their identity and true passions while still receiving an education. Many students love traveling and having real world experience while still having a classroom education. For example, pupils learn about different cultures and languages in the real world, but know the basic core subjects taught in classrooms. This option prepares kids for the future by exposing them to diversity, improving their social skills, and allowing them to explore new places. Allowing the pupils to travel lets them have experience and stories to share to future generations. On another note, many students are on their way to becoming professional athletes and are commonly traveling to international competitions. Online schooling lets the child to be active and start a career while improving knowledge through online classes. Others do not realize that these kids are on the road to their future early and need to travel to begin their career. As well, military families are often moving from place to place, starting over every time they move. The children in these families often have to restart social lives several times and are confused on how to complete classes. Distance learning makes moving much easier and the student does not have to start again and possibly lose credits from school to school. These pupils can better use their opportunity to travel while using distance learning to receive an education.

To add, many students often feel overwhelmed and their classes are paced too fast for them to keep up. If distance learning is provided, the student will have more time to fully comprehend the material and be ready for the next exam. For instance, having classes paced to the student's needs decreases teen stress and anxiety. Stress and anxiety are rapidly increasing disorders in teenagers. According to teens, school is one of the leading causes for their mental disorders. Classes do not stop for students, they proceed even if they do not fully understand the material. Online schooling allows for kids to choose their class times and go at their own pace in order to learn their material. Also, grades would increase dramatically, allowing for students to pass their classes and earn their diploma. Classes would benefit the students by allowing a slower pace and for the pupils to take their time.

Furthermore, families often have difficulty transporting their children to school. Distance learning omits this problem and also allows for kids not to have to ride the bus daily. For example, families would not have to worry as much if the guardians of the child have to go to work early and stay late to provide for them. Many students have to find a ride with a friend or ride the bus every day which is quite inconvenient. If the family does not have a car or a form of transportation for the student, there is no problem getting the child to class. On the other hand, less use of cars and buses decrease the carbon footprint. The environment is benefited and less toxins are released into the air. The environment is being destroyed daily and having less automobiles used would help everyone. Transportation becomes less of a problem and the environment is benefited if online schooling is provided.

In conclusion, distance learning would benefit the young adults who need to travel, decrease stress by allowing a slower class pace, and decrease transportation issues. This option is quite important because teens are finding their identity and future career at this point in life. If online schooling is provided, traveling families would have much less difficulty and the carbon footprint would decrease dramatically. Distance learning should be the future of schooling so students can discover themselves while receiving an education.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"One of the most challenging experiences I have had in my life was when I struggled to maintain my grades in school. I had always been a good student, but as I entered 8th grade, I began to feel overwhelmed by the workload and pressure to perform well. I found myself falling behind in my classes, and I was afraid that I would not be able to graduate on time.

The first obstacle I faced was the sheer amount of work I had to do. I had to juggle multiple assignments and projects while also keeping up with my daily classes. I found it difficult to manage my time effectively and often found myself procrastinating or getting distracted.

To overcome this obstacle, I decided to take a more structured approach to my time management. I created a schedule and prioritized my tasks based on their importance and deadlines. I also sought help from my teachers and tutors, who provided me with additional resources and guidance to help me stay on track.

The second obstacle I faced was my own self-doubt and fear of failure. I had always been a high achiever, and the thought of not living up to my own expectations was crushing. I found myself getting discouraged and giving up easily, even when I was making progress.

To overcome this obstacle, I focused on building my self-confidence and resilience. I reminded myself of my past successes and the skills and knowledge I had gained throughout my academic journey. I also sought support from my friends and family, who encouraged me to keep going and never give up.

The result of my efforts was a significant improvement in my grades and overall academic performance. I was able to graduate on time and even received several awards and recognition for my achievements. I learned that with hard work, dedication, and support, even the most challenging obstacles can be overcome.

In conclusion, facing obstacles and overcoming them is an essential part of life. It teaches us valuable lessons about perseverance, resilience, and the importance of seeking help and support when needed. I am grateful for the challenges I faced in school, as they helped me grow and develop into the person I am today.",1,llammistral7binstruct,3
"You ever get a project that you have to do and you never know where to start? School's ending, you and your best mates are talking to each other, deciding what to do in the summer and finally relinquishing the fact that you've made through the school year again. However, there's always that pesky thing that you fear most, school work during summer break. Maybe it's beneficial to you, and they want to make sure you aren't behind in a class or fail next year. But what kind of project is it, is it a do it yourself or a ""do it yourself""? So you're naturally stuck, sitting there at your desk, thinking about how to get this over with so your mom can turn back on the internet to your room. Or so you think, you wouldn't have to be, if your teacher told you what to do, and you finish it without a second thought and it's off until the cows come home. Summer projects should be teacher designed due to most students not wanting any work over break, students might get huge amounts of stress, and students can take less time finishing it.

Rarely students want work over the break, most don't want to think about school work. Yes, work is work and you still have to finish it because school, but no kid wants to think about work during their own break. If it were teacher designed, at least they have some sort of guideline to follow so they just have to use a little bit of their brain. For example, if it were teacher designed, students can look what at they have to do, finish it, and go hang out with their friends. If it were student designed, students would have to think about what they have to do, finish it, and by the time they're done, summer is over. No one wants to have that happen to them, because they want to enjoy themselves and save the project for maybe near the end of the summer.

Stress, something that comes naturally, and something you should not obtain from an outside source. If students have to do their own project, their stress goes up by a lot. When students go out during their break, let's say to the mall or something, they have to remember in the back of their head that they have that project to stress over about. Stress is still going to be there whether or not it's student-designed or teacher-designed, but at least with teacher-designed, it would be a lesser amount of stress unlike if it were student-designed. For example, if students were out hanging with each other, then one realizes they have to go home and finish their project. They get home, pull out their project and if it were student-designed, they'd be stuck there all day, worrying about the project, which adds to more stress. If it were teacher-designed, students would finish in a heartbeat and go back to hanging out with their friends, because students don't have to know what to do, because the teacher told them, what to do.

Time, a very limited resource that you either waste, or spend wisely. It is not something you should be spending on thinking about a project. Both teacher-designed and student-designed take time, teacher-designed just takes less time. You could very well spend that time on doing what you want to do with your time, not something you don't want to do with your time. For example, if the project were teacher-designed, you can finish it whenever you want to finish it and it'd take less time, if it were student-designed you would have to think about it more, which takes more time, so you wouldn't be able to do a good job on it if it were at the end of summer break. Whenever I receive a project, I always say ""why do I have to do this,"" if it were student-designed. If it were teacher-designed, I'd say ""Oh, a project, well at least I have something to follow,"" Also with student-designed, no examples, so more time wasted trying to figure out what to do.

So you finally finish your project, but at what cost? The amount of more work you had to do, the amount of more stress added, or the amount of more time wasted? At least if it were teacher-designed, you can get rid of those mores and it'd just be a negligible amount. So why waste extra time when summer break should be time to yourself, and why worry about thinking on what you should do, when your teacher already thought out for you? Don't waste yourself worrying about some project that you have only yourself to rely on, have a project that's already thought out for you, you just have to finish it.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"Being an individual is an important aspect of life that leads to greater self-confidence and independence. It means being true to oneself, not conforming to societal norms, and making one's own decisions. However, it is not always easy to be an individual in a world that is constantly trying to change us. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of being an individual and how it leads to greater self-confidence and independence. I will also discuss the challenges of doing this and include quotes from Ralph Waldo Emerson to illustrate the idea of being one's true self in a world that is constantly trying to change them.

Being an individual means being true to oneself, not conforming to societal norms, and making one's own decisions. It means being able to think for oneself and not be swayed by the opinions of others. This is important because it leads to greater self-confidence and independence. When we are true to ourselves, we are able to make decisions that are in line with our values and beliefs. This gives us a sense of purpose and direction in life. It also allows us to be more confident in our abilities and decisions.

However, it is not always easy to be an individual in a world that is constantly trying to change us. Society often places a lot of pressure on us to conform to certain norms and expectations. This can be seen in the way that we are expected to dress, act, and think. It can also be seen in the way that we are expected to follow certain career paths or make certain decisions based on our gender, race, or other factors.

Despite these challenges, it is important to be an individual and to stay true to oneself. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This quote illustrates the idea of being one's true self in a world that is constantly trying to change them. It means not following the crowd, but instead forging one's own path.

In conclusion, being an individual is an important aspect of life that leads to greater self-confidence and independence. It means being true to oneself, not conforming to societal norms, and making one's own decisions. However, it is not always easy to be an individual in a world that",1,llammistral7binstruct,2
"Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment,"" is a powerful message that emphasizes the importance of individuality and self-expression. However, while I agree that being true to oneself is important, I believe that it is not the only factor that should be considered when determining the greatest accomplishment. In fact, I believe that having help from school, teachers, and groups is crucial in achieving success in life.

Firstly, school plays a vital role in shaping young minds and providing students with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in life. Without a proper education, it can be difficult for individuals to achieve their full potential. Teachers, in particular, are essential in guiding students and helping them develop their unique talents and abilities. They provide feedback, offer guidance, and encourage students to pursue their passions. By having access to quality education and the support of dedicated teachers, students are better equipped to navigate the challenges of the world and achieve their goals.

Secondly, groups and communities can also provide valuable support and guidance to individuals. Whether it be through sports teams, clubs, or volunteer organizations, being part of a group can provide a sense of belonging and purpose. Groups can also offer opportunities for personal growth and development, as individuals learn to work collaboratively and develop leadership skills. Furthermore, groups can provide a support system, as members can offer advice, encouragement, and a listening ear when needed.

In conclusion, while being true to oneself is important, it is not the only factor that should be considered when determining the greatest accomplishment. Having access to quality education, the support of dedicated teachers, and the camaraderie of groups and communities can all contribute to an individual's success in life. By recognizing the importance of these factors, we can work towards creating a world that supports and encourages individuals to achieve their full potential.",1,llammistral7binstruct,4
"The author states that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because, venus is a really hot planet and the earth is in between venus and mars but venus is closer to earth. Scientists start to study venus but it's very too hot to go to venus so scientists try to make inventions that will get information on why venus is so hot. Venus is dangerous because it is soo hot and you wouldn't make it in the conditions there.

In paragraph 3 the author states "" Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments"". It also states some examples of the dangerous things like ""erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes "". Scientists are still trying to visit to venus surface even tho it's inhospitable because they are fascinated by venus because venus use to be the earth's most-like planet in our solar system. Scientistist wants to know what it is that is making venus sooo hot because like in paragraph 4 it says "" long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". Then scientistst study that venus is the hottest planet and they are now trying to study why venus is so hot.

Now NASA is trying to send humans to study venus. NASA also has a solution for scientists to go study venus in paragraph 5 it says "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" NASA made this solution so that scientists would study venus but at the same time they would be safe while doing it . NASA is now workin on other approaches to studying venus. In paragraph 7 the author states "" some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"". This also shows that tying to study venus is dangerous because you wouldn't make it very long on the planet even if you've invented things to try and help.

The author is trying to get out that studying venus can be very dangerous because of the conditions venus is going thorugh. Venus is the most hottest planet and it is not the best planet to be studying because it is very dangerous. ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Phones and Driving

Should a person text and drive?

Really don't you think its all up to them because I don't. I don't think you should always do it or always have to the need to use your phone while thing is happening around you. Imaging going 65 mph and your jus on the phone playing candy crush. What the chances of something wrong happening. A LOT

Driving is dangerous for those who don't really know a lot About it. You have to be sharp on the look about. What if a kid runs out to get his ball and you don't pay attention because you were on the phone? That would be devastating for your and the kid's family, having to act like you really wasn't on the phone lying that you didn't see him. All because they were on to phone and couldn't wait till, they were at a full stop to check it.

I think that's the only time you can check your phone, and I'm not talking about checking your whole social media accounts. I mean just making sure no one texted you or missed an important call. If you do pull in anywhere and check, if its that important you wouldn't put anyone else's life in danger. Its all safe or not safe at all and I don't care how long you've been driving anything can't happen to anyone. You can't de greedy and pick yourselves over a kid or young person who might have had something great happening.

Its never okay to check your phone while moving your vehicle. A lot of people lose their life's and others because there being irresponsible and just can't leave there phone alone. I hate driving and seeing someone texting like put it down before you run into me. Also, there are so many injury's and deaths because of it. There are almost 390,000 injury's each year and one out of fours car accidents are based on texting and driving.

Should a person text and drive? Really don't you think its all up to them because I don't. those are the reasons why I wouldn't want no one texting and driving its dangerous, and immature. I think everyone should just listen to the rules. Especially if you think about it, a law that could save your life or anyone else on the road. I think people shouldn't text and drive.

"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

In other words, students are required to complete tasks over the summer to keep learning additional information on a specific subject.

These summer project can be designed by teachers to ensure that the students learn something over the break.

They can also be designed by students to have them enjoy summer break while learning something new.

The summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to choose a topic they are interested in,allow them to enjoy doing the project, and allow them be stress free.

There are many reasons why students should choose a topic they are interested in.

Specifically, it allows students to research topics they are into which can help find their future career.

The task students assigned to themselves can help construct ideas to eventually finding their career.

This can help many high school students who struggle with finding a career at the end of their high school years.

Another reason is, if a student is into a specific subject, then he wouldn't want to be assigned to a topic irrelevant to the subject he is into.

If the student was assigned a subject he was uninterested in then it would be likely that the student won't do the project.

Therefore, if a student is designing his own project then he wouldn't need to worry about getting a topic they aren't interested in.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to enjoy doing the project.

For example, students can lack motivation in doing a project that they don't enjoy.

Consequently, this can affect a students grade depending on how much the summer assignment is worth in the gradebook.

It will also make the summer unenjoyable for students because they are going to have to do work they aren't into.

Another example is, students can put more work effort in something they enjoy rather than something that is boring for them.

This can get them a decent grade on their assignment and allow them to enjoy the project.

In conclusion, summer tasks should be designed by students to allow them to have the most enjoyable experience in the summer.

Assignments given over the summer should be student-designed because students should be less stressed over the summer.

One way is, students should be stress free from school on breaks because it allows them to truely enjoy their summer.

Breaks are meant for students to calm their minds from school and not having to be stressed of school all year long.

This also refers to the previous example stating that it will make summer unenjoyable and prevent students from calming their minds from school.

Another way is, the less work needed to be done on the project can help keep a student from stressing out.

This can make the student take less time doing work and can enjoy doing other activities over the summer.

Consequently, student-designed projects can have less work letting the student be free of stress.

Projects should be student-designed because students are allowed to choose subjects they are intrigued by and research them.

They can also have fun while completing the project without lacking motivation.

Finally, having a student-designed project can help keep students calm because they know what they are doing.

Therefore, summer projects should be designed by students.",0,persuade_corpus,1
"The reason why I certainly beleive that this is a natural landform is because what it acually is reveiled to be is common on that planet. It is usuall to see stuff like that on that planet. That one just had shadows to make it look like a face.

""the face"" just looks different from the other martian mesa's. Some can argue an say it could be lots of other things such as sign of life on mars or being made by aliens. But im sure that the scientist opinions are more likly to be true then some reporters opinion. The martian mesa explanation is way more reasonable then it was made by aliens. There are many things to back up that it is just a natural landform. What does anyone have to back up that aliens made it. Nothing supports that.

One thing that supporrts it being a natural landform is that in 1998 MGS flew over cydonia for the first time. The MOC team snapped a picture that was way more clear an easy to see then the ones the vikings took. It reveiled that it was not an alien monumeant it was just a natural landform.",0,persuade_corpus,3
"About 60% of students have a hard time catching onto lessons taught by another person and having a way to better understand or they have social anxiety and can't be around people without feeling uncomfortable or panic. Most students will be able to learn better in an environment they feel comfortable in. For an example, their own homes that way they aren't as anxious. Although, Most parents believe actual school is better for students because they might have a better chance in getting higher education and better jobs. Some students will benefit from online classes because it is less stressful, better learning environment and opportunities, and they have a better sleep schedule than they do in actual schools.

To begin with, students benefit from online classes due to it being less stressful. In schools the teachers make a short time period on assignments and have close deadlines which causes students to stress about getting them in on time. For example, english teachers give esssays and most of the time only ONE class period to finish them, but in some schools you dont have long class periods like middle school you get about 30 minutes each class everday for 7 periods. Deadlines can cause stress due to it being so close and not having enough time to begin and finish your work. Even with missing school days it takes away from your time to get your work finished on time but most teachers wont allow you to get more time. Online classes give you enough time to make up and finish your work so that you are stressful and not panicing about turning in late or missing assignments. They also allow you to get enough time to begin work and finish it. Unlike actual schools, online schools are flexible with your outside of school schedule.

Furthermore, better learning opportunities and understanding. Most students cannot learn by being taught by a fellow classmate or teacher. For example, student athletes might not catch onto whats being taught unless its demostrated by their sport. Students can learn by using their hobbies or even visual productions to understand what they are learn or being taught,but most students might enjoy learning and teaching themselves the lesson they are giving. From a students perspective notes are better taken when they are giving the documents and lessons to them and they take them theirselves rather than a teacher handing them a note sheet. For some students visual examples or lessons are easier for them to catch onto unlike a paper giving to them. Other students learn quickier when they can relate their hobby or sport to what is being given to them . Onlne classes allow you to learn in the way that you can better understand.

Last, online classes allow you to have a better sleep schedule. Actual schools can cause lack of sleep due to the stress students have from their assignments. Online classes allow you to get a good rest and a flexible schedule. These classes can be taken at anytime so that you wont have to worrying about staying up late trying to get everything done and losing sleep. You can take online classes in the morning or afternoon and in between you can nap or get rest so that you are not straining your brain. Lack of sleep can cause you to lose focus so it is very important that you have a good nights rest. Online classes make it easier to sleep at night because classes dont run late and assignments dont have close deadlines. Classes taken online give you enough time to almost finish or finish assignments so you are not up all night stressing and rushing through to get everything done and on time.

In conclusion, online classes are a better benefit for students. Students benefit in more positive ways from online classes. Students can benefit from online classes because they are less stressful, better learning environment and opportinies, and a better sleep schedule .",0,persuade_corpus,3
"One of the potential benefits of changing the school lunches to healthier options is that it could promote better health outcomes for all students, regardless of race, religion, or body type. Fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods can be better for students’ physical health, and many nutritionists recommend more plant-based proteins like beans and quinoa when possible. However, some students may feel excluded if there are fewer foods that fit in with their religious or cultural backgrounds. To combat this, schools can offer a variety of foods from around the globe, taking into account dietary guidelines from different religions and culture. This can encourage students a chance to explore and sample dishes that they may not have had access to before, while also promoting a more inclusive and accepting environment. In addition, vegetarian and vegan options should be made available to ensure that all students have access to a healthy and nutritious meal. Ultimately, making the shift towards healthier school lunches can be beneficial for all students, but careful consideration must be taken to involve and accommodate all populations in the process.",1,chat_gpt_moth,1
"Summer is a time of fun under the sun, but when teachers assign work over the break that can be a real buzz kill. When teachers assign the project they're the ones who most likely designed them too. If the teachers design the projects it will most likely be some boring experiment or essay, but if students design them they get the chance to do whatever their education-loving heart desires. Having students work on their own projects will let them work at their own pace and they could have as much fun with it as they want.

If students are able to design their own projects they would be able to work at their own pace. Most projects are due at the end of the summer when school starts, however, some projects are due within a month or two after school gets out, which can probably take up most of the summer. If the students are able to design the projects themselves, the time in which they turn in their projects could be a month after school starts or a day after school ends. The good thing about working at your own pace is that there's less stress. No stress means you have more fun, which brings me to my next point.

School can be boring, and projects are a pain, but if students are able to design their own projects they could have fun with whatever they decide to do. When teachers assign projects to do over the summer it's most likely something archaic like ""What happens to a plant when it is deprived of sunlight?"" or ""Write an essay on Shakespeare's metaphors in

Romeo and Juliet

"", which are no fun at all. Letting the students design the projects will make them more interesting for them; whether it be a science project or an essay, if you're able to design your projects you could base it on a topic that interests you the most. Combine that with being able to do it whenever you want, and you got yourself a very fun school project to do over the summer.

Although, if you do design your own project you're responsible for everything to do with that project. Teacher's design projects to help you out and make sure that you don't go off track and stay with the assignment at hand. Even if they do that, it will probably be either something rather difficult or something you need to finish within a month. If students were in charge of that they would be able to do a project that's easiest and best for them and within a reasonable time frame.

If teachers are going to assign projects over the summer, at least let the students design the projects themselves, they'll be able to work at their own pace and have fun with it. If your teacher assigns something over the summer and you have the option to design the project yourself take that opportunity. If you don't have that option, talk to your teacher about letting you do it on your own terms, staying within the project guidelines of course.                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Having a strong and well education is what is the most important when it comes to any person seeking the knowledge and insight to be able to pursue any career opportunities or other varying professions and lifestyles; furthermore, it is more widely known for students to attend a school and take courses from there. Although it may be a better environment for students to go to classes and communicate in real life with their teachers and other peers, It would be more beneficial for students to have the choice to attend classes from home through the use of either online courses or video conferencing. Online classes would be a great tool and advantage for those who wants to continue their education because it provides scholars not only to be more efficient and organized, but to also help those who are not comfortable in the environment of a school in general. It is a modern era for both the teacher and the learner, so it is essential for all persons to have the opportunity to continue their education with ease and will.

Without a doubt, it is a necessity for any student to have the skills of efficiency and organization through a means of completing the assignments and work provided to them, for it is what will help them in the near future. Online classes with help because to allows them to take notes or tests in a familiar atmosphere, which will make them more paced and manageable. Being able to do work or assignments at home is favorable because it lets students complete tasks without the need for judgment and pressure a normal, old fashioned institution would emit. Stress is a common factor in terms of learning, for the expectations of a normal school would have any person feeling doubtful and overwhelmed; however, these online classes provide students with the chance to do what they need to do with simplicity and intuition. Some may say that one would not be able to learn well when only looking at a screen; however, video conferencing allows the student to still be at home, but also learning face to face with their teacher or professor. Having all of your courses laid out with clarity through digital aspects shows that it would be easy for any person to become more organized and efficient though navigating these courses with clarity at home and managing your time well in a comfortable setting with efficiency.

Not every person has the same lifestyle as the next, everyone has their own differing personalities and character traits that may or may not clash with others. A comfortable atmosphere for a person seeking to expand their knowledge will be most beneficial because it allows someone who has difficulty in social setting to not feel as if they are being punished for wanting to continue on with schooling. People can be complicated, one may never know what is going on in another's life. Every person is different, no one is the same as the next in any way, shape, or form. Taking classes from home would help eliminate those who are uncomfortable in the environment an everyday school would have, such as those with anti-social tendencies or anxiety. Having so many students in just one building causes many conflicts, whether they be through two students, or between a student and their teacher. Within a school, it is inevitable for there to be an issue depending on how one may react and feel. Although school from home would not completely solve these problems, it would help prevent conflicts such as bullying. Staying at home with the responsibility to complete work should be desirable for any person wishing to pursue their educative life, no person should feel uncomfortable or in dismay when it comes to wanting to learn.

Despite what one may believe when it comes to school, it is essential for anyone to have the opportunity to attend online school from home. Being in the familiarity and comfort of your own home causes beneficial aspects to ones life. It allows them to become more efficient, along with other skills needed to be successful. Prevention of any sort of conflict is important and needed to help whoever is having an issue. Online school is the new frontier, and to many, has already done its justice. Online school should be seen as the next best thing for any person who wishes to pursue their knowledge. It is time to get past the old-fashioned ideologies that learning should be done in a classroom, we are past that age and are continuing on into a new one.        ",0,persuade_corpus,2
"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅

First impressions are like, super important, right? Like, you know, when you meet someone new and you get that one chance to make a good impression. But, like, what happens when that first impression is totally off? Like, what if you come across as super boring or weird? Can you change that first impression, or is it like, set in stone? 💔

So, I think first impressions are kind of like, impossible to change. Like, once you make that first impression, it's out there and it's hard to take it back. For example, if you show up late to a party and you're all sweaty and out of breath, it's gonna be hard to change that first impression. People are gonna think you're, like, irresponsible or something. 🙄

But, on the other hand, sometimes first impressions can be changed. Like, if you show up to a job interview super early and dressed to impress, people might think you're super eager and motivated. Or, if you're in a new social situation and you're able to, like, quickly make someone laugh or something, it can change that first impression. 😂

So, it's like, kind of a mix of both. First impressions are hard to change, but they can also be changed if you, like, put in the effort. It's important to be aware of that first impression and try to make a good one, or at least a good enough one that you can build on it later. 🤔

In conclusion, first impressions are like, a big deal. They can make or break how people see you, and it's important to be mindful of them. But, it's also important to remember that they're not always set in stone, and you can always try to change them if you want to. 😃

"This new technology to allow us to read students emotional expressions is brilliant. Reasons being is it allows students to show their true emotion regardless if they act happy, or sad.

To prove that this technology can be used in advance, most of us know the famous picture of the Mona Lisa. Using this advance system most people will say she is just happy and smiling, 'but she's actually 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry'. Obviously we have more then one feeling but this is an prime example of showing this can work on other people and pictures from years ago and still show their full emotions, most people can claim to be happy a lot and be completley devasted.

"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author believes that studying the planet Venus would be a rewarding endeavor. The author presents his claim and supports it very well through the knowledge he already has about the planet, the knowledge that the exploration of Venus might uncover, and persuasion through relating to his readers. This allows for the author to very clearly and precisely get his point across to those who might read the article. It also creates a strong way for the author to connect to his readers.

When the author uses the knowledge that he already has about Venus, he is trying to convey that what information we have on Venus is already important. In Paragraph 4, the author presents the idea that Venus ""may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". When the author introduces this concept, he also describes the surface of Venus to be ""rocky"" and ""includes similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,"". Becuase the author presents the idea that Venus might have been like Earth and then goes on to describe this, he strongly supports his claim of how rewarding studying Venus could be. He is also trying to spark an interest in his readers regarding the study of Venus.

In Paragraph 6, the author suggests that researchers need to get closer to the ground.

When he says ""researchers cannot take samples...from a distance"", he is urging scientists to find ways to get closer to Venus's surface. To support this he also presents that scientists ""cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else"" without getting closer. He uses the curiousity of man to lure them into what he wants them to. This proves to be strong support for his main claim. This also leads right into the persuasion aspect of his support.

The author uses persuasion throughout the article, but in Paragraph 8 it is used excessively. Near the end of the paragraph, he introduces the idea that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."". When he uses ""should not"" in that sentence, he is adding a strong opinion to his conclusion. In doing so, his opinion also contributes to the persuasion factor. This allows for him to call out to the reader individually and emotionally affect them. Using persuasion made way for the author to support his claim very well and influence the reader to think the same way as him.

Overall, the author has a very well thought-out way of supporting his claim that studying Venus would be a worthy persuit, despite the dangers. The author hits the brick wall head on by first presenting the knowledge he already has. This allows for the readers to have a little bit of foreground to play on. Then, he introduces the knowledge that could be gained by studying the planet, giving the readers a clear-cut example of how studying Venus might present important information. Finally, he includes persuasion, making it possible to influence the readers one by one. In conclusion, the author supports the claim, studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents, very well.",0,persuade_corpus,1

"Does taking classes from home benefit students.

People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids don't learn and they do nothing. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids.

Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons. for example , I will provided you three reasons why

I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it .

Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition.

First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. That's why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable.

Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too.

Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and it's hard for them to attend any school. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them that's why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless.

in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it.

When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isn't going to help you. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but.

From my personal experiences, I can tell that extending the amount of time spent at school would have a negative effect on the overall well-being and mental health of both students and teachers. Many adolescents battle stress, lack of sleep, and other issues related to their mental health, and a longer school day could make provide difficult for them to manage these issues. Similarly, teachers would be overworked and overstressed by having to teach during longer hours, leading to a decrease in the quality of their job performance.

Rather than extending school hours, I believe that it would be beneficial to re-evaluate the traditional curricular design and increase the amount of breaks during the day. Allowing for shorter classes, more recess, and longer lunch breaks can help students acquire the skills and knowledge they need without putting an extra burden on their mental health. Furthermore, taking more breaks helps improve productivity significantly, and this could be beneficial both for students and teachers.",1,chat_gpt_moth,0
"Have you ever woken up in the morning and wished you could just stay in bed? Many students probably experience this on a daily basis. Luckily, with the advent of computers and the internet, you may not need to leave bed to go to school at all. Many schools already use computers to allow students to work on and turn in assignments online. However, some schools now allow their students to attend their classes online as well. The benefits of this option are significant and numerous. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they could attend classes under conditions that would normally prevent them from doing so, learn in a more comfortable environment, and reap the benefits of a more logistically efficient system.

Firstly, the option of online classes would allow students to attend classes despite conditions that would normally prevent them from doing so. For example, during winter, schools across the nation often close because of hazardous weather conditions that make it too dangerous to travel to school. However, with online classes, students could simply be instructed online, avoiding many missed days of valuable learning. This system would also take pressure off of school systems to keep schools open on days with questionably dangerous weather. Without worrying about missing yet another day of classes, schools could make the safe choice and close on more of these days. Additionally, it is common for students to stay home a few days when sick so that they can recover and avoid infecting their classmates. However, it is often the case that despite the risk of infecting classmates, students are still well enough to participate in class, but are unable to do so. With the option of online classes, these students could still participate without risking infection. A present day example of the possible utility of online classes is the Coronavirus outbreak. Many school systems worldwide have already shut down as a result of the virus. With online classes, these school systems could continue to instruct their students while also decreasing the risk of Coronavirus spreading. Overall, there are many situations in which online classes allow instruction to continue when not normally possible through traditional methods.

Another reason that students would benefit from online classes is that home can be a better learning environment than school. In general, home is more comfortable than school for many kids. The ready access to food and a bathroom, as well as an environment that one is familiar with, means that many students would be more relaxed learning from home. With a lower stress level, students would likely be more productive and engaged in their classes. Additionally, some students can get stressed out over the classroom environment. Personally, I know that I have felt anxious in situations when I didn't know the answer to a question I was asked or when I had to read aloud. For me, and for many other students, attending classes from home would help to alleviate some of that stress and anxiety. Some may argue that taking classes from home would reduce students' level of focus. However, students already have to focus at home for homework. By having kids focus on a class at home, it would actually help reinforce their ability to focus and be disciplined in an environment in which they could be easily distracted, which is a useful life skill. Overall, in the more relaxed environment of home, students could be much more productive and successful in their classes than if they attended in person.

One more significant reason for providing the option of online classes is that they are much more logistically efficient than classes taught in person. Firstly, there is no travel time from home to the school. Additionally, transition time in between classes and time for lunch could be saved as well. This saved time could be put to various good uses. Classes could be lengthened, or another class could be added to students' schedules. Students could also get more sleep in the morning; many teenagers are chronically sleep deprived, so this would be a massive benefit. Students could also use the extra time to get a job. One argument against online classes is that they would stop kids from learning to interact in person. However, the time saved through online classes would actually allow students to spend more time out with friends, which would teach them to get along with other people well. Another benefit is that students could attend distant schools that would not be practical to attend in person. Besides the saved travel time, switching to more online classes would eliminate a great deal of paper waste, as many more assignments and materials would probably be online. This would benefit the environment, and it would keep students from having to keep track of both physical and digital assignments and documents. Finally, school systems could save money on a great deal of physical infrastructure, such as school buildings, classroom materials, and buses. The funds saved could be redirected towards giving students computers, paying teachers more, or investing in better learning resources. Overall, the saved time and money from switching to more online classes would significantly benefit students and teachers.

As technology advances, the classroom should advance as well. By embracing the opportunities created by technology, students can learn in ways never before possible and receive a higher quality education. Through more efficient use of time made possible by technology, students can spend more time having fun or earning money while still learning just as much. The online learning environment can make it easier for some students to get engaged in classes. The money saved because of online classes can be reallocated to improving students' education. These great benefits, among many others, demonstrate why online classes should be an option for every student.",0,persuade_corpus,4
"Summer is an important time of the year for students; it is an good time for rest, but it is also an good time for further education. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue their learning during their break. These projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed because, by designing their own projects, students can learn more about what interests them, express themselves creatively, and gain more responsibility.

However, some people who disagree with this point of view may say that teacher-designed projects can be designed to fit into the next school-year's curriculum allowing students to prepare for their next year of learning. For example, if environmental health is a significant theme in the 10th grade science curriculum, teachers can design summer projects for rising 10th graders about the environment so they get a head-start in understanding the subject. While this argument may be true, specific, teacher-designed projects take away the many positive effects of student-designed projects, including the ability to learn more about personal interests.

Student-designed summer projects allow students to learn more about the interests they have. For example, if a student is very interested in government, he or she can complete a summer project about the two-party system in the United States, the bicameral system in Congress, or even the differences between government at the federal and state levels. Discovering more about personal interests is essential to students. By finding out more about what they like, students have many more opportunities in front of them. Personal interests lead to college and career interests, which lead to structure in adult life.

Students can express themselves and use creativity when designing their own projects. For example, if students are allowed to decide how they present their projects, they can express themselves through drawing, painting, photography, or even web-design. If students can express themselves creatively, they can free their minds, decrease stress, and become further engaged in their learning. Teacher-designed projects would destroy this creativity, and students would be stuck in a non-creative box. If this were the case, students would become bored, and the negatives would far outweigh the positives.

Student-designed projects give students more responsibility. For example, if a student was assigned a teacher-designed summer project, he or she would only be responsible for completing the project; but if he or she was told to design and complete a project, he or she would have to research possible topics, search for relevant information, find ways to present it, create a plan, and execute the plan. This shows that students have significantly more responsibility when designing projects themselves. This responsibility will train students and teach them how to work independently, which is an essential life skill. If students completed a teacher-designed summer project, they would not learn this skill as well as they would when designing a project on their own.

Simply stated, teacher-designed summer projects do not provide the many benefits of independent summer projects students design on their own. If a student was assigned a teacher-made project, he or she would miss out on personal interest discovery, creativity, and responsibility. More schools should replace teacher-designed summer projects with student-designed projects.",0,persuade_corpus,0
"some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home because they can not be on their telephone and not due what they are spouse to due.

First, they can get distracted, In my position

I Can get distracted went I am at home doing homework i want to wache TV even some time I do not finish my homework because i get a lot distracted. I want to play whit my brothers go out side play soccer and i say just for a little I am to playing with then but a get distracted and i for got the i have to do homework or study for a test. Some time I get distracted by seeing my brother playing video even went they is a lot of noise i get distracted because i want to what is happening or what is going on. I remember one day the I have to finish a test review at home because I do not have time to do it at school I do not finish because I get distracted by brothers. They were making a lot of noise and i could no concentrate because of then. My brothers are the same way as me they can get distracted fully easy and not pay attention on what they doing maybe they star by doing they homework but they do no finish because they get distracted by the TV or the video game.

Second, they can use the telephone some time I get a lot distracted whit my telephone because I away want to be in the telephone. Went i home I just want to be in my telephone and i do not do my homework. I get fully distracted because I want to text whit my friends or playing video games in my telephone and not Du what i suppose to to do. Went I am at home I have all

I want my bed my telephone the TV the I forgot the I have to how or study for a quiz or test. Only because I at home and I have all i need some time i do not want to do anything

I get distracted fully easy and more if I have my telephone in front of me because i want to leasing to music or video chat my friend and talk and pay attention on what I suppose to due. Some time my mom tell that I have to stuff in the house so I have to do it even if I am doing homework or studying I have to what she say and then a can kip doing what i was doing. If I have my telephone whit me the only thing i what to do is be in the telephone because it is a easy way to get distracted and not due what you suppose to due.

Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. The is say for then because some the students do not ride the bus the parent have to take then to school and the take a lot of time some time because they have to wait. Even they are going late for work and they do not have tame to take then to school. They may say the if they have school at home they do not have to do all the work by taking then to school. some time a lot of kids get bully at school and it more easy for then do do it by home because they do not have to deal with at school they do to have to be worry what would happen to then the net they or what does people are going to do whit then, But I chose to not have school at because some people can get distracted I not saying the all people have the problem I am just saying the i have the problem they my not have. But I do not like have home school because i want to see my friend graduate whit then have fun some time go to party and now more people have more experience.

In solution, people can do what is best for you if you like do school by home because you do not like people or have personal problem or have i disability that you go it no one is going to say anything. But some time people want to have friends have fun because you are a person the like to be around people that good to. the only thing i am saying chose what is best for you not what is best for other people or what other people think. Make you own decision be proud of you no matter what.",0,persuade_corpus,3

"Being an individual is a vital part of having a strong sense of self-confidence and independence. People should not be ashamed of the traits that make them unique; instead, those traits should be embraced. This mindset can be difficult to maintain in a world where there is pressure to conform to group standards. As famed American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson once eloquently stated, “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” It is human nature to seek approval from our peers and loved ones, but it is important to remember that we should strive to live our lives in a way that is true to who we are. 

This endeavor can be a daunting task; it takes courage to be our true selves when faced with the trials and tribulations of life. However, understanding our own values and feelings can ultimately lead to a more meaningful life. If we continue to deny our own thoughts and feelings, we risk letting go of our authenticity and hard-earned independence. As Emerson said, “It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.” We must not lose sight of our inner voice and remain true to our core beliefs, no matter the consequences.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"The author explains how studying venus can be a good thing but also very dangerous. Do to human curiosity we will most likely one day discover and possibly live on venus!

The author tells readers how NASA is working to make a "" Blimp like vehicle""

that would hover above about 30 miles above the surface. This would be good to stay out of the way of the rough ground and keep tempuatures around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Also the author explains in paragraph 4 how it was most likely just like Earth many years ago and could be possible for people to live on one day again in the near future. The author also explains in paragraph 6 that with the technoligy that we have today we would have to stay above the surface and would have to use photgraphs to show what the ground looks like from a far distance.

The author explains that NASA should spend more time making a space ship or a land cruiser that is able to withstand the heat and pressure from Venus. I think that the author has a good point in trying to find out what this planet is like, because one day it can and will be lived on. The author states that Venus is Earths ""twin"". By the author stating that, it makes me and others think that it can be used just like Eath. Some have to understand that Venus needs to have many changes before humans can live there and there is a great group of people working on that right now.

Thanks to human curiosity and to NASA one day hopefully in the near future venus can and will be a used planet. We as a whole should expand where we travel to explore new places that can be used instead of all cramping up here on Earth.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4

Reason for the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) read the emotional expressions of a student can benefit by how the teacher can teach beacuse if a student make different emotions like confuse,bored or overwelm while a teacher teach can show that what the teacher is doing is not working.

Whe a sutend show a confuse emotion is showing that the work the teacher has given is to hard to comprehend. Showing to the tacher that she has giving to much of a hard work for a student to understand it. Giving that situation the teacher can make a plan to low donw to a level of the student grade she is teaching.

A bored student is not much good to have in a class because whe a student is bored it intent to start distrubtin a class or come to fall a sleep in class. Thas showing to the teacher that the way is teaching is has become to un-interesting,that should let the teacher know that her has has to come more interesting and\or active so students can show more curiosity to class and get inspired to learn the class.

When a student comes overwelm it coem a stress and start to panic for all the work the teaches have givin. Showing the student being overwelm shows teacher that it have giving to many work or the class have become to hard to comprihend. Tha so ones the teacher knows that student s have starting to become overwelm because of her class she has to star changin her plan of teaching so tudent can learn better and a eassy way.

In conclution the class room computer could reconice when the student is becoming confused or bore and /or overwelm. That could modify the lesson so it can be an efective to the human instructor. So they are able t o plan a better way to teach students a easy and better way so student can comprehended better",0,persuade_corpus,1
"Setting  an  example  is  an  effective  way  to  influence  those  around  us.  For  example,  the  recent  phenomenon  of  “Juuling”  has  demonstrated  the  power  of  setting  an  example.  This  trend  has  swept  classrooms  and  has  made  e-cigarettes  seem  like  the  norm;  in  studies,  researchers  have  found  the  direct  correlation  between  seeing  peers  use  e-cigarettes  and  developing  the  habit  oneself.  Similarly,  popular  online  challenges  have  been  effective  at  influencing  younger  generations  and  can  be  a  powerful  form  of  setting  an  example.

Drawing from theories in evolutionary psychology, there are parallels to setting an example and how animals such as wolves act in a pack. A pack of wolves often looks to one or two members to set an example and guide them. In the same vein, setting an example can be a powerful force for cognitive growth and social change. 

Setting an example is the best method of influencing individuals. This is because individuals are more likely to assimilate into the groups and adopt behaviors seen from those in the same social setting. Examples can be very persuasive and prove that such behavior is possible. Furthermore, when those around us set examples of excellence, it often improves the quality of the entire group by pushing one another ever higher.

In conclusion, setting an example is an effective way to gain influence within modern day society. Whether it be through trends such as “Juuling” or through setting a standard of excellence, setting an example can be an impactful way to shape the thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors of those around us.",1,chat_gpt_moth,2
"Votes for the president of the United States are counted each election in two ways, the popular vote and the Electoral College. The popular vote is the people's vote, which allows our democratic nation to vote for their leader themselves, and the Electoral College is dependent upon the popular vote, and casts electoral votes based on the number of Representatives and Senators each state has in Congress (Source One). People have consistently debated over whether or not this was a fair election process, due to the fact that the people's votes do not directly go to the president. Because of this, many people want the Electoral College to be gone, and people have attempted to abolish it in the past. The Electoral College should be abolished and the US should adopt the popular vote system as their only system because we live in a democratic nation, the current electoral voting process may not represent the popular vote, and it's a more fair system.

As citizens of the United States of America, we depend on the fact that we live in a free nation that values our justice, liberty, and voice. Included within our voice, we also depend on our democracy, that allows us to have say in who runs our country and how. It's important that we take advantage of this voice we have in the government, and it's also important we are represented fairly within it. When we depend on electors from the Electoral College to vote for who our states popular votes went to, they may not be doing that. They ultimately can decide who they are voting for, and if they decide to vote for the opponent, no one can stop them. It's very easy for them to betray our trust without our awareness (Source Two). Source Three also states that ""that trust is rarely betrayed,"" which makes it clear that although uncommon, there have been incidents in the past where the citizens have been represented unfairly. In a democratic nation, we should have true sovereignty and be able to cast our popular vote, and know that it is being counted and included in the final say of our leader.

Overall, the Electoral Vote may not represent the Popular vote. As mentioned, there have been incidents in the past that have indicated the truthfulness of this statement. For example, in 1960 John F. Kennedy was almost opposed by unfair elections due to our country's people being misrepresented (Source Two). Even if the popular vote of our state goes one way, the ""'faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Source Two). The electors are unreliable and may go one way just because they please to do so while leaving the faithful citizens in the dust with their decisions and votes meaning nothing. The popular vote system would better represent the people than the unreliable Electoral College system we have now.

The popular vote system is a more fair system, one of many reasons being that it would eliminate the advantage large and ""swing"" states have over others. Currently, ""swing"" states are being given more attention to be the candidates because the candidates realize that the fate of their presidency may be dependent upon these states (Sources Two and Three). Since the Swing states are the ones who's votes can go either way, the candidates spend more time with these states in order to insure their likelihood to achieve the states electoral votes. This is not a fair process because the other states are not getting to know the candidates like these states do. The same thing goes for large states. Since the number of electoral votes you have is dependent upon population, the larger states have more electors/representatives. Therefore, the presidential candidates want to achieve as many electoral votes as possible and will make sure to appeal to the larger states, leaving the smaller states at a disadvantage due to misrepresentation. The popular vote system would take everyone into account evenly, and therefore represent everyone fairly, and make for a better voting system.

All in all, the current Electoral College system is unfair, misrepresented, and unappealing to a democratic nation. The system should be abolished for all of these reasons, and allow the popular voting system to come in to play. The popular vote system would allow each citizen to be represented equally, and create a more level and fair environment. It's important that a democratic nation feels like one, and that we are all represented fairly, and there's no better way to do so than by being our own representatives.    ",0,persuade_corpus,4
"When you are in seek of some good advice, is just one opinion really going to suffice?

Deciding between the wrong and right choice is challenging and may even be a little frustrating, so naturally, you are going to want to ask guidance from multiple people. collecting advice from multiple sources is good for your decision making because different relationships interfere with others opinions, You can find people with the same interests as you to get advice from, and when you ask more than one person it feels way more confirming.

Getting advice from people who have different relationships with you may affect who you ask and the advice you get. If you want advice on your relationship with your mom, spouse, or cousin you probably don't want to ask your mom, spouse, or cousin for advice about them selves. For me, personally, I like to ask my friends relationship advice about my family and ask my family advice about my friends that way no one knows I am asking for advice about our relationship but I still get all the opinions I need. Relationships get messy when they cross paths so asking multiple people for advice will really help make sure you are making the right decision.

your probably like well what do you mean by crossing paths, I mean when one person has a relationship with someone and you have a different kind of relationship with the same person. Thats why I think asking many people with different relationships with you is so important.

like many of you I have family, friends, and family friends and depending on the advice i'm looking for I will go to the people who relate to my problem the most but sometimes it is good to get an outside opinion from people who don't relate.

When you need advice about a relationship you go to the people closest to that person and the people closest to you but if you go to someone totally opposite of those ""requirements"" you may get a perspective you never thought of before. Having different opinions when it comes to relationships is all about perspective so get all the opinions and don't be afraid to ask for those opinions from anybody.

If you ask multiple people about a interest that you share you can keep progressing and getting better at that interest. When doing a hobby the easiest opinion or advice source is probably going to be the people who also share that love for the hobby. I love to do anything that has to do with design weather it be fashion, homes, or even the perfect lay out for my locker, my mom also shares the love for design but has a very different style then me and my friend likes to design to but has a very different style as well. I ask advice from many people weather they have the same style or not so I can get all perspectives. If your hobby is watching sports and you are trying to decide what your favorite sports team is going to be that is perfect time to ask many different people with many different team preferences for advice.

My dad likes the Redskins my mom likes the Seahawks and 90% of my friends like the Eagles, So if I only ask my mom I might not have made the best decision but if I ask everyone and compare and contrast than I will probably make a much better decision. collecting information from everybody that you ask and then think about it is always better than settling for advice from one person.

There are certain things that you need more than one opinion for or more than one person giving you advice. When it comes to something like appearance people arent going to want advice from there grandma so they might ask there mom but when you think about it she has to say you look good shes your mom so you ask your friend. Asking multiple people for advice about appearance is for, in my opinion, comfort that you actually do look pleasing so in this case multiple opinions is very important. Another example of something that people always need assurance on is are they good at something meaning once again you need opinions and advice to make the right decision to keep going or stop with that particular something. Again you probably should not ask you mom "" am I good at football"" she will probably say yes but ask advice from a coach or a teammate so you get comfort.

The last thing people always need advice on to feel comforted is being accepted by others for this I would say get advice from anyone because no matter what there are going to people who dont accept you. If you ask multiple people for advice on the subject it will be easier to come to terms with the subject and you can accept it. Being assured you have something or you look like something needs way more advice than just one person.

It is good to ask more than just one person for advice because you get more perspective and insurance. you need to realize the people who have different relationships with you, have the same interests as you, and need comfort in advice like you do are great people to go to, to get advice. Asking anybody for advice or and opinion will automatically make your decisions more correct or easier but asking multiple people will be more effective. When you need advice always ask more than one person.               ",0,persuade_corpus,3
"Dear Principle,

I very well understand the conflict in this situation, but I would like for you to consider the following. Lately the population has become very overwhelmed with problems. Global Warming, violence, starved people/homeless people, and even litter/trash like this situation. However, having the kids be required to pick up trash can make a difference. We can make it fun to change the kids minds, so then they will want to help. Have the kids choose a litter group from 4-6 people and choose a team name, and all through out the year each day will have a different litter group on duty. Only one hour a day! I also very well understand that the kids have other priorities on there schedule, that's okay! Having the litter plan for a different group to go every day can fix that. We have an extensive amount of students at this school, therefore lots of trash too. It will take many to make a difference, and i know we can do it. Doing the right thing in this situation may not change the world, but it *will* make a big difference. Maybe when outsiders see the whole school participating they'll want to dig in too! This earth needs our help, and by doing the work we can! Thank you for taking me into consideration.

Since
