First, they would learn in a better way, also people need someone to advise them. As well, the world would not be destroy as it is now.

People would learn in better way. To begin, if people seek the guidance from experts they would not make a lot of mistake, and their life would be better. For example, a person who seek the guidance from experts it would have more opportunities. Likewise, a student who doesn't understand math class can talk with his teacher or other expert in math and the teacher can explain it. On the other hand, if the student doesn't talk to anyone he provably would fail math. In addition, a person who get a new job need someone to explain it what to do. While, if nobody explain it the new employee would make many mistakes. As you can see, the people who take the advise of a experts would learn better.

People need someone to advise them. For example, everybody have problems, but not everybody have someone to advise them. First, a new student came to my school and he didn't know the rules of the school, so he did something that it wasn't good and he get in big trouble, but if someone would explain him he would't get any trouble. Therefore, many teenager do whatever they want because they doesn't have anyone to guide them, and the result of that is those teenager get it many troubles each day. While, the teenager who are guide for any expert they do well in everything they do. As you can see, everyone need someone to guide for the right way, and nobody would do a lot of mistakes.

The world would not be destroy as it is today. For example, if everyone would have the opportunity to have someone to advice them the world would'n be danger to anyone. Furthermore, in many countries the people are in danger because their governors doesn't know how to guide a country, but if an expert took the control of the government the people would not be in danger anymore. Likewise, teenager sometimes live by them-self, so they don't have anyone to tell them what is good and what is bad; teenager many times do bad things and they don't even know. As I repeat, if the whole world would have someone to guide everyone the world would not be destroy as it's today, everything would be in peace.

In conclusion, if everyone would have the opportunity to have an expert guide during life the entire world would be better. Likewise, people would make better choices in their life. Also, with a expert guide the people nobody would be in danger again. Furthermore, teenagers and kids would have a better future around the world; as well, the world would be in peace, and people would learn in a better way. Also, if someone doesn't know something he/she can talk with an expert and the expert would guide her/him. Finally, life would be better and easier if everyone talk to an expert what is going on, so nobody would do a big mistake.",0,original_moth,"Task:

In this world in which we live in, cell phones are a growing market as well as cars. The fact that we depend on cell phones throught the course of our day for numerous reasons.

Drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving because its easier to operate a phone in your hand than a cell phone that is not in your hand. Emergencies can occur while driving and you need to report the emergerncy while driving. Cell phones does not cause as big of a distracHon that other things that is done while driving.

A lot of people are in an uproar about driving and using a cell phone and someHmes it is overrated. Trying to operate a cell phone with one hand while maintaining driving has no danger to it. A phone that is mounted on the holder that begins to ring is harder to operate answering, dialing and switching calls.

Most Hmes the mounHng is not secure or has defected parts which can cause more of an issue than having it to your ear. Most people have older cars and cannot a? ord to upgrade and dont have the speaker opHon, which usually allows everyone surrounding your car to know you business.

I cannot say it enough, emergencies happen in a ?ash. Driving and you see a accident that needs emergency aLenHon you need to be able to use the cell phone to call it in. Things happen so quickly now and it could be your phone call that saves their life. Also if a person is lost and no gps signal but calls can be made a person should be able to dial someone by hand and get direcHons out of harms way. Emergency is a big deal in cell phone usage.

Cell phones do not cause as much as a distracHon than people make out to be. As a driver a person should always be aware of the road and be able to mulH-task when using a cell phone. Most Hmes its other things besides a cell phone that cause a distracHon but blames the cell phone as a scapegoat. There could be test on the driver liscence test that we should take to see if were able to drive and talk on the phone instead of just banning it.

Talking on a cell phone and driving a car may be a distracHon for some but not all. It should be our call on if we are focused enough to drive while talking. Although some people are said to have had bad behavior while talking and driving some are very responsible. TexHng and driving is di? erent from talking and driving and that should be the boundary. Each person should be accountable for their acHons just as speeding.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Making Your Own Decisions: The Key to Learning and Growth

As an 8th grader, I've realized that making your own decisions is super important. It's easy to get caught up in what adults say and do, but sometimes they don't know what's best for us. They might give us advice, but it's not always right for our situation. That's why it's important to make our own decisions and learn from our mistakes.

First of all, when we make our own decisions, we learn how to think critically. We have to weigh the pros and cons and make a choice based on what we think is best. This helps us develop problem-solving skills and become more independent. It's like practicing a muscle - the more we use it, the stronger it gets.

Another reason why making our own decisions is important is that it helps us build confidence. When we make a decision and it turns out good, we feel proud of ourselves. It's like, ""Hey, I did that! I made a good choice!"" And when we make a mistake, we can learn from it and do better next time. It's not like, ""Oh no, what will my parents think?"" or ""What will my friends think?"" We can just be like, ""Okay, that didn't work out. Let me try again.""

Also, when we make our own decisions, we learn how to take responsibility. We have to be accountable for our actions and their consequences. It's not like, ""Oh, someone else made the decision for me, so I don't have to worry about it."" We have to think about how our choices will affect ourselves and others. It's like, ""Okay, I made this decision, so I better make sure it turns out good.""

Finally, making our own decisions helps us figure out who we are and what we want. When we're always relying on adults for advice, we might not have a clear idea of what we want. But when we start making our own decisions, we start to figure it out. It's like, ""Oh, I like doing this. I don't like doing that",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Write an essay exploring why teenagers should make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes, rather than relying on advice from adults.",8

I believe that allowing students to participate in community service would have a positive impact on the school and the community. By engaging in community service, students can not only contribute to the cleanliness of the streets but also develop a sense of empathy and compassion towards others. While it is understandable that some people may not enjoy cleaning, I believe that by starting small and encouraging students to help in a variety of ways, such as painting the sidewalk, cleaning the beaches, or helping those in need, we can begin to change the behavior of others and make a positive impact on the community.

While it may not be feasible to require students to participate in community service every day, I believe that setting aside a few hours each week for service would be a good start. This would allow students to continue with their studies while also giving them the opportunity to give back to the community. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial for the school to partner with local organizations to provide students with opportunities to help those in need, such as the elderly, disabled, or veterans.

Overall, I believe that allowing students to participate in community service would be a valuable addition to the school curriculum. Not only would it benefit the community, but it would also help students develop important life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and empathy. I hope that you will consider this proposal and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

159424F57C24,"Well for one if you seek more then one person you might likely find someone who will help you. If you only seek one person they might not be of assistance to you. I usually like asking one person like an adult, mostly because they won't ignore you, and they may have the answer your're looking for. I don't like asking students in general, for help cause they will most likely ignore me most of the time, and they may probably not know the answer to your question. Another way I think asking one person for help is ok, is if you ask and adult, ""I always ask an adult first."" If I ask an adult I usually ask just the one, like my teacher for example. ""Because asking an adult usually helps a lot."" Lets say you asked more then one person, and they all had different answers, you could narrow it down to who had the best answer, letting you decide which one made the most sense. And you're learning better that way, ""in my opinion"". Here are some examples of why asking more than one person is ok.

One of them might have the correct answer

They may walk you through it

Narrow it down finding different answers

Both sides have their ups and downs. But if i had to pick one side, it would have be asking more then one person for help. If i'm asking more then one person then I like asking students, because asking more then one adults it would be to weird. It would be almost like asking 20 ensigns for help, don't waste your time asking for that much help, just ask one of them and they will have the answer. Also asking for an adults help makes me sometimes feel uncomfortable, I like asking my friends and see what they think. Some reasons about asking one person for advice

They may be to busy helping someone else

Your not learning better that way

Missing more information

Your also not meeting other people if you just ask one person for guidance. If you don't have a lot of friends ask others and polity say for example ""hey whats the square root of 256,"" some may not know, some might smile and tell you, and after they probably will tell you their name. If you ask nicely then maybe you'll have a new friend. It's always better to ask more then one person for help. So out of all I say asking more than one person for help is better in a lot of ways, then asking only one person. Always do this in the future if you need assistance, guidance, or even help always ask more then one person, it's better this way and you'll learn a lot more and comprehend what there telling you.",0,persuade_corpus,,8

I believe that it would be good for kids to half to do work. but many kids have activities after school so they may not be able to do this. it should be a choice but not a thing they should have to do. there for i think that kids should not have to do community service because many kids now a days have chores to do at home not ones to do at school to we go to school to learn about skills needed in the real world not to do work for the community sake. i believe that we are at school to learn not to work. this is not just a easy thing to decide on a lot more people should decide on this besides just the principle, this should be up to us the students. not just us are parents as well, and there should be a reward if students do this work. like a treat like ice cream, or a pizza party.

4237C276C527,"I am for the development of driverless cars. I think it would be cool if we had cars that did the work for us. They are just like smart phones in a way. However I don't think we should completely have no control over the car. People may start thinking that they can do whatever while the driving is in progress. That is not the case. Drivers should still pay attention to the road as if they were normally driving. Driverless cars will benefit us in a positive way.

One reason why i am for driverless cars is for the disabled people who can't drive like others can. Those people deserve a way to get around town too. Another reason why i think having driverless cars is a good idea is because of the simple fact that it is an option. People can buy a driverless car but still take over if they want to or need too. Another good reason for having driverless cars is for long distance drives. Sometimes flying a plane to a far destination is too expensive but if a car could take people long distance to where they need to go without themselves having to drive such a long way it would be more easier for themselves. The only concern with driverless car would be ""Who is at fault"" but that could be easily depicted i'm sure.

Driverless cars would benefit us greatly. It shows no harm to anybody who would like to have no driver. For all the reasons previously stated it is a good idea to have driverless cars. After all, it is our decision to make whether or not we want to have driverless cars. ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

8614BB3690FA,"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to recognize emotions. As mentioned in the article, this technology can be useful in many formats; including psychology, art, and acting. Reading human emotions can be beneficial in some areas, but it is not valuable in the classroom setting because each student learns differently, computers should not be used as teachers, and the cost is not worth few benefits.

In the article, Dr. Huang predicts that with the new technology, the computer can recognize when a student is confused or bored and change the lesson to fix it. While this seems helpful, not every student learns the same way. A lesson that some students will understand, other students will be confused on. It would not be fair to the students who understand the lesson to make it easier because they might become bored, which the computer would then have to modify the lesson more to fix. The Facial Action Coding System is able to read human emotions, but it cannot satisfy the need of each individual student in a classroom. This technology also is not valuable to the classroom because a computer instructor is not valuable to the classroom in the first place. Computers should not be used as teachers because it can unemploy teachers, completely change the education system, and possibly bore students. The education is fine as it is without adding a foreign techonology for students to adjust to. This system should not be implemented in schools because of budget costs, also. The technology is probably expensive and is another thing the school would have to budget for and taxpayer dollars would go to. Recognizing emotions is not important enough to be worth that amount of money.

All in all, this technology is not the most beneficial or valuable device to be using in the classroom. Because of the cost, different learning styles of students, and familiarity of a human instructor, the Facial Action Coding System should not be put into a classroom setting. While this technology is helpful in other areas, it does not have worth in the education system. ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

D9C076040D83,"What do you think it would be like to tell others emotions with just a quick look? Well, with the Facial Action Coding System, FACS for short, you can. It quickly scans your face and tells your emotion. This shows being helpful for finding out friends emotions, showing the mindset in our classes and showing hidden feelings also leading to a glimp of mental illness. The real question now is, how will this be helpful in the classroom?

In the classroom, students show certains signs of how they feel. In paragraph 5, the text says "" ..you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."". Often when we are sad we frown or our eyes water, or when we are happy we smile but, just because we smile doesnt mean we are genuinely happy. The FACS has been classified the many different muscles in your face and has classified six basic emtions,as explain in paragraph 3. A quick look and we can understand if your happy, sad, or even bored.

While we are busy learning often times, we can zone out or we can be confused but not speak up about it. No worry, the FACS is here to help teachers understand how you feel. In paragraph 6 the author says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."". Later in the same paragraph it states "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."". This shows the FACS has more of a use than just telling emotions, it can help you understand ways to make your classroom entertaining. It can also help you realize how fast certain students are working, or their mindset which they may keep hidden.

As humans, we often hide our true feelings. We may struggle opening up to others about how we feel out of fear of rejection or looking weak. Towards the end of paragraph 6, it says "" Most human communication in nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that,too."". The FACS is able to detect multiple different emotions. It can not only tell the basic happy,sad,or mad, it can tell confused, bored, or depressed all just by using muscles in your face. This can let us know how students really feel when they walk in. It can give them a glimps into what they may have going on with them mentally, giving more awareness in mental health. This can help save students.

The FACS can come as an important tool to both teachers and students. It can show students how to react to their friends feeling a certain way. It'll give teachers ideas as to how to make interesting yet, entertaining lessons for their students. Lastly, if can give us an idea of how the other around us truely feel and way to help them. The FACS can be very helpful for students now and caring for toward into life.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

i have noticed how you have changed the school policy. i respectively disagree with that. i understand that you expect good effort in class, but i just can not agree with your rule. a lot of great athletes have a c average, but if you wouldn't let them play, our teams wouldn't be as good until they got the grades up.

people should have the right to do what they want even if they have a c average. in my opinion, a c average is still passing and it is better than a d average. i think as long as they are passing they should be able to do what they want. if kids cant be in football and volleyball and etcetera then school classes would be more kayo tic. some of the athletes in our school are very active, but have a c average. if the school board didn't let them play, class disruptions would be at an all time high.

90BF447C6E83,"Changing the school menu can be a controversial topic, as it has both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, it is undeniable that nutrition is important, especially for growing children. Introducing a more varied and balanced menu would offer students the proper assortment of nutrients needed for a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, children are more likely to taste new foods when their peers are trying them as well. This could help students be more adventurous eaters, resulting in healthier long-term dietary habits.

On the other hand, there is a risk of unfamiliar foods being met with negative responses. Many students resist change and may be unwilling to try new meals, particularly those which are not part of their culture or personal likes. Furthermore, the cost of introducing higher-quality ingredients may put financial strain on families, especially those whose budgets are already stretched thin. Finally, dining hall staff may need additional training to prepare the food, resulting in additional expenses.

In conclusion, while changing the school menu has the potential to bring multiple benefits to students, it is necessary to consider the potential drawbacks as well.

My heart pounded in my ears so loudly to the point where I could not hear what my theatre director, Generic_Name, said next. After telling the cast that all Generic_City schools would be closed on Monday for the teachers to better prepare for potentially having to teach students at a distance due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, Generic_Name explained that there was a possibility we would sadly not be able to put on our spring play and the students might have to take online classes for a certain amount of time. In this day and age where technology dominates the world, a decent amount of schools worldwide are pushing for more online classes to be available. Students would not benefit from taking classes at home because there are many students who don't learn best through self-led classes and students would miss out on the classic interactive classroom experience.

As many teachers learn through their personal studies and time spent in the classroom, there are many different types of learning styles that must be catered to in order to set a foundation for a student's success, therefore, teachers must be physically present if a student needs help. I remember when I was a freshman and my history teacher decided to not physically teach the class anymore because a group of students were making fun of his teaching style. All of our classwork was posted online and we had to direct ourselves through our lessons. When it came test time, my normally prominant ""A"" became a ""D"" after completely failing the exam. I was affected by the fact that I didn't comprehend what I thought I had learned over that past month and felt like my time had been wasted. I didn't learn anything by ""teaching myself"" because my job as a student should be to learn, not to do both. My sister, Generic_Name, shared a memory with me from elementary school that also exemplifies this where her 6th grade teacher had the students guide themselves through an online math unit. When Generic_Name was a confused about a problem and tried to ask a question, the teacher said that the questions had to be limited, as it was a self-directed class. As an anxious 12 year old, this caused her not to do her best in school not only because the teacher wasn't allowed to answer her questions, but because she didn't digest what she learned through the technology. Elementary schoolers are not developed enough to take on directing themselves through their education. Frankly, elementary schoolers are not mature enough for that level of responsibility, and maturity is not something that can be taught online.

Not only can disciplinary actions not be monitored, but also the energy that a classroom brings can not be recreated virtually through technology; only through the good old-fashioned interactive environment. My friend, Generic_Name, is currently enrolled in two online courses: History and English. I once told her that I had won a lollipop while playing a fun Kahoot game in English. She told me how much she misses playing Kahoots with a group of people. Online classes are meant to be rigorous, but they leave no room for students to have a break. Generic_Name mentions that she can find review games online, but when a whole classroom isn't competing against each other for a piece of candy it simply does not match that level of excitement. Classes are meant to push students and challenge them, but what many adults forget is that teens are people too and sometimes need an enticement to make learning fun, like the review game I played in geosystems. These games can not be experienced the same way virtually as opposed to a classroom. In my U.S. History class this year, we have switched back and forth each unit between writing a DBQ essay and having a socratic seminar. I have found it more beneficial to do a socratic seminar because I love feeding off of what other people have to say about the challenging topics we discuss and I found that I learn more from my peers than from the research we have to do for our DBQ essays. The online classes do not have a socratic seminar option because there has to be other students present to perform one. Learning from others, especially one's peers, is something that carries into the real world through jobs, relationships, and even in electing government officials. Human interaction is fundamental to one's growth, and online classes do not cater to that.

While online classes do have their drawbacks, they also have their perks. Some say that online classes make it so that students can work around their own schedule. It is true that students can work at their own time and speed through online classes, but being physically in a classroom provides more structure to the curriculum through already built in time. A scenario that exemplifies this is earlier this year my Algebra 2 teacher told us that the only way we could review for our test was if we video called with her at 8pm the night before. It wasn't mandatory, but it was highly encouraged. Since I'm not the best at math I decided I would tune in, but that night was my sister's band concert and I missed the call. The online call did not work around my schedule and I did not get to review for my test. Online classes seem like the schedule is flexible, and granted a lot of times they are, but there are times like this where a later scheduled class conflicts with a student's personal life.

Technology is one of the most useful creations of our generation and having online classes is taking advantage of it in a positive way.

FD59AB66D7FD,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to cross the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean? Have you ever wondered what dangers could happen while at sea? Have you ever thought about how the work done as a child can benefit how you are as an adult? Well, if any of these questions has even came to your mind than this essay is perfect for you.

Crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans would take a long time but I would say that it is worth it. Luke Bomberger traveled across the Atlantic six-teen times and he crossed the Pacific twice. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program so that you can travel across the oceans too. While onboard a Seagoing Cowboys' ship you can have baseball and volleyball games, you can have ping-pong tournaments (also known as table tennis), fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and playing all sorts of fun games to pass through the days onboard your ship. There are so many advantages to joining the Seagoing Cowboys but if you aren't sure if it will be safe then I will write about the little disadvantages of coming onboard.

So, your wondering about the disadvantages of joining the Seagoing Cowboys? Well, one day Luke Bomberger was working at his job as a night watchman and he had to check on the animals on board every hour. One night Luke slipped on a latter and he cracked his ribs. Luke started sliding toward the edge of the ship where a small strop of metal kept him from flying overboard. So if you think almost plumaging into the deep, dark sea is a disadvantage then there you go. Just because something dangerous ""could"" happen doesn't mean that it should hold you back from doing something that you could enjoy though. If you never try out something than you will never know if you will like it or not, so I suggest joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

Kids are always wondering why they have to do so much work. The reason is so that the work that they do as a child will benefit them while they are older. Luke Bomberger had worked on his aunt Katie's farm as a little boy and it had prepared Luke for hard work to be done at sea. You need to be able to work hard if you are going to join the Seagoing Cowboys than you need to ""work hard at work worth doing"" (quoted from Teddy Rosavelt).

If you like adventure than the Seagoing Cowboys program is perfect for you. Remember that this program isn't just about fun but it is also about working hard. There may be danger while at sea but it's a low chance that the danger will affect you. So join the Seagoing Cowboys and have the time of your life!",0,persuade_corpus,,3
AC7AB280A93C,"One of the major benefits of being able to attend school from home is the increased convenience for students who would otherwise find it difficult to find the time to attend a traditional educational setting. Home schooled students can often take courses at their own pace and structure their daily schedules however they choose, without the need to be tied to a specific school day or class hours. Additionally, students who are home schooled are often able to learn in an environment free of external distractions, which can help them to better focus on their work. 

However, home schooling can create some potential drawbacks as well. Home schooled students may lack the in-person social interactions of traditional education or the structure of the school day, which can lead to decreased motivation and attendance issues. Additionally, home schooled students may also struggle to gain the job preparation skills that come from a more traditional learning environment, such as becoming comfortable in a professional atmosphere, building good interview skills, or networking. 

Overall, there are both clear benefits and drawbacks to being able to attend school from home. It is important for potential students to consider these before making a decision about how to best pursue their educational goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Research the benefits and drawbacks of students being able to attend school from home.

507CBD8E9670,"Studying planets is often hard because of the conditions in space, and also on the planet Venus there are also very harsh conditions that humans cannot survive. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Exploring Venus can be a very risky planet for us to expore until we get better technology.

Venus is often reffered to as Earth's twin because it is the closest planet to be like Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus would be hard to expore becuase of the planet's suface reaching up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet of solar system and if we tried to land a rover there the metal would just liquify because of the extreme temperature's. NASA however, still wants to try to study the planet but they would have to hover over Venus because of the extreme conditions on the planet's surface. Even at 30 plus miles in the air in Venus the temperatures can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Rendering standard of photography and videography ineffective. The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth's level.

More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas,or anything else, from a distance. Threfore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
falcon_180b_v1_362,"I think schools should implement policies that allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. This practice will help parents stay involved in their children's education, ensuring they are on track to succeed.

Firstly, online monitoring allows parents to keep track of their children's progress in real-time. They can see if their child is struggling in any subjects and address it before it becomes a larger issue. For example, if a student is consistently getting low grades in math, their parents can hire a tutor or work with the student on their math homework to help them improve.

Secondly, online monitoring can also help with attendance. Parents can see if their child is skipping classes or arriving late, which can be an indicator of problems at home or school. They can address any issues with their child and work with the school to ensure their child is attending classes regularly.

Some people argue against online monitoring, saying it can cause unnecessary stress for students. However, I believe that if parents are involved in their children's education, it will motivate them to do better and reduce any stress or anxiety they may have.

Overall, I think that implementing policies that allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online is a good idea.

679515AC8FDB,"Essay : Phones and Driving

Cell phones have evolved in our society everyday in which case its made a huge impact in our daily lives. Technology has grown dramatically over the years. The majority of people own a cell phone in which they use on a day to day basis including while driving. Even though it is not authorized people still tend to do so. Drivers should not be able to use or operate any type of cell phones or any form of technology in which case it can be very dangerous. In our society people have been so focused on trying to do multiple things all at once that we are willing to risk our own lives and others safety.

Texting, calling or reading messages while driving can easily lead to a car crash. Keeping your eyes off the road for less than 5 seconds can cost you or somebody else's life. According to The National Safety Council states that cell phone use while driving leads up to 1.6 million crashes each year. There's actual statistics that shows that 26 percent of people driving say have admitted to texting while driving (Teens and Distracted Driving). These are just some facts that prove using your phone while driving can become a major threat to our community. Did you know that teenage drivers are four times more likely to be involved in a car crash than adult drivers? It is causing insurance to increase and causes concerns for others health.

Throughout time humans have always tried to multitask simply because nowadays in order to get a job, cook, work, or have kids you need to know how to do multiple things all at once. Yet, humans are naturally not great at multitasking. While driving your main priority is to focus on driving and just driving; if people were actually good at multitasking than ""texting while driving"" rates of deaths wouldn't be extremely high as it is now. According to American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) traffic crashes are the #1 cause of death and injury for people ages 16-20, with more than 5,600 teens dying in motor vehicle collisions each year. While being behind the wheel you need to be inventive, always look at your surroundings, all mirrors, and everywhere.

Texting while driving is threatening because you see it all the time yet, people still don't change their bad habits. If it wasn't harmless than there would've been any commercials of people getting into car crashes on the television nor either any signs stating ""no texting while driving."" The rates of using a cellular device are so high that statistics show that driving while texting is six times more dangerous than drunk driving. The U.S. bans text messaging. There are three main types of distractions which are visual, manual, and cognitive. Texting while driving uses all three of these distractions in which it will cost you a life including jail time all because humans can't put the phone down for a few minutes. The U.S. bans text messaging so don't even try to do it.

In conclusion, humans should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. Simple facts and statistics show us textual evidence in how texting while driving is life threatening. As we know, numbers don't lie. There over 1 million car crashes each year; not only that but we live it everyday and watch how innocent lives are taken away day by day because of cellular devices. Save a life. It can most definitely wait. A life is not worth a text or a call.

01ACD1326679,"Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to you because I personally think that Policy 1 definitely is a better policy, there is quite a few explanations to my opinion. Okay, I have always wanted to have our phones out at school but, nobody would ever let us. Now that you give us two policies to think about which one we like better, I choose the one where we can have it out. If I was a teacher I would not let my students have there phones out. I would not tolerate it, because when i am up there teaching I do not want to be up there so I can see them texting or calling people in my classroom. I am there to be educating my students, so I am reasoning with you there but, they can be turned on because what if there is an emergency and they don't have the time to turn there phone on? So we need to be able to have our phones on us and turned on at all times. Now places where we could be on our cell phones is in between classes, when your in the bathroom or walking the halls, and after you finished your work and at lunch. If kids are on there phone in free time, there will be less problems, less fights, less kids arguing because they will be so focused in on there phones. So I really think you should look at the pros and cons and reconsider this cell phone problem.

Sincerely,

FEF2E1612F55,"Dear senator,

What are the chances in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states? Does the Electoral College work?

First of all, What is the electoral college? The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the selectors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president,and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

What's wrong with the electoral college? Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all systemin each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on the tight races in the ""swing""states. It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best  arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elactions are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

When the ship went pass Cydonia the first time and snapped the ""Face Like Photo"", they realizied it was only a mesa. They wanted to realse the face to the public to get attention that NASA was discovering new things on different planets. When the public got the photo though, most people thought that it was created by aliens, without any evidence. Even NASA told the people that the shadows were a ""huge rock formation. . .which resembles a human head. . .formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"", according to the text ""Unmasking the Face of Mars"". There are some reasons and details that show that NASA was right, it is only a mesa.

When the mesa was released to the public, the ""Face on Mars"" became a pop icon, inculding in starring in a Hollywood film, appearing in many books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. While all of this was happening though, NASA wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. When the public started to beleive that NASA was hiding facts about ""The Face"", NASA went ahead and started to budget the next spacecraft to Mars, the Mars Global Surveyor. When the spacecraft lanched 18 years after the Viking missions ended, the spacecraft first job was to find the ""Face like mesa"". When the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, they were able to snap a picture of the face like mesa 10x sharper than the Viking did. What they revealed was a natural landform.

Even when the Mars Global Surveyor snapped the natural landform, people weren't satisfied. The Face on Mars was taken during the winter on parts of Earth. Because parts of Earth was in winter during the picture taking, Mars was cloudier than normal. People thought that because of the clouds, important alien like features could of been hiden. When NASA heard about this, they decided to take another spacecraft to Mars in 2001. This time, Mars wasn't cloudy and we had the technology to see little things all the way down to a small shack. There it was proven it was only a mesa that caused all of the problem for NASA. This is all how NASA proved that the ""Face"" on Mars was only a mesa with weird-like shadows.

A79CF9AC2B58,"Teachers give you projects you don't want to do because the topic is too hard or you don't have interest in it is the worst feeling ever. Students should be able to decided what projects they complete during the summer break because it would mean more to them, if they could pick a topic they savior.

Students should design their own summer projects; we all know that projects can be very challenging and time consuming. However, it gives students an activity to do over the summer break rather than staring at the walls or playing on their PlayStation, Xbox or laptops all summer. When students design their projects they will most likely remember to do these projects if they had the power to create them. Therefore, students will produce greater and better projects and put more time and effort into them.

Therefore, allowing these projects to be students designs would be unquestionably beneficial for the students. Teachers would make these projects too hard and students will lose interest in doing it. Students can pick any topic as they please; forcing a student on a topic is not good, it will lead them to not having any ideas or them being stuck on a topic and worst: them not finishing the project. With the freedom of design students can have a topic on the solar system, school food, phone usage in class and bullying. It gives them the opportunity to do creative things with their work. Student designed projects gives them more space and freedom to develop an idea and put more effort into the project so they can get the credit they desire.

As a result, although many teachers worry that over the summer break, students will forget about most of what they have learned during the school year. The solution is to assign students projects over the summer that the students can design , so they can maintain knowledge and be ready for the next school year. ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Now think of a world without them...it would be different, wouldnt it? Yes, indeed it would be, the world would be less hectic and cleaner place to live.

First, Life without cars would make life much less hectic. In Vaunban,Germany there is an upscale community where there are no cars. People either walk, ride bikes or take the public tram. A servey shows ""70 precent of Vanuban's families do not own cars, and 57 precent sold a car to move here"". People move to Vauban to enjoy a ""car-free""...stress free life. ""Im much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" (sorce 1 paragrah 3) The ""car-free"" world of not having to worry about car payemrnt, incerance, and gas money is a whole lot better than a car dependent world.

Second, Limiting our car use would help make this planet cleaner. Pollution issues have gotten so bad that ""...Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". (Source 2 paragraph 10) In paragraph 14 it states that ""after five-days of intensive smog...the smog rivaled Beijing,China, which is one one of the most polluted cities in the world"". France uses more diesel than gasoline, therefore making up 67 precent of all vehicles in France. The use of these harsh fossil feuls is a huge problem that can help be controlled by limiting our use of automobiles.

Third, Although some may argue that we need cars to fuction in our modern world, there are other options that we can choose. For example, If everyone took public transportation such as the subway we would be cutting back tremenously on the amout of feul consumed. Another advantage of using other forms of transportation other than a car would be that you wouldnt have to worry about your car not starting, or not having enough money too fill your tank. Other forms of transportation would always be reliable and convenent. You would also feel good about helping the enviornment by not adding extra gases to the ozone.

To finish up, Limiting our use of cars would make life easier and cleaner. In source 3 it states ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Many people are convinved that a ""car-free"" life would be much nicer than the hectic car-consumed life we've all grown so accustom too. Limiting our use of cars is a good idea for our stressful lives.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
7A266925C5AB,"The Face On Mars

Have you ever seen something crazy on something, maybe a face or something that you seen before? Have you thought about how that face or something else has gotten there? Well, for a start it defintley wasn't aliens! Just like the face on mars, people belive that the face was created by aliens! But that isn't true, the face on mars is just and only a natural landform that some how was created on earth.

For my first reason on why the face on Mars is just a natural landform is because NASA later revelied that the face was not made of aliens, but by shadows. A few days after that image was found, NASA needed to take a look and figure out what made this incredible and scientififc picture so unique, and why and how it was formed. Later on, they have came up with an good explaination about this unique image. NASA said this,""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Scientifically, the face was made from a natural cause, so it makes it a very different natural landform.

Now, for my second reason on why this was not made by aliens, but just a natural landform is that there is no scientific research showing that aliens do exist and created this face. Now I do know that some people say that they have seen aliens, but scientists dont think that is one hundred percent true because they don't have any evidence suggesting that aliens are real. Many people to belive in them, but how do we know that they are actually real without any scientific knowledge? But now after NASA did some research, they found out that even though we don't have information about them, aliens did not create that face, it was only a natural landform.

For my third and final reason, why the face was not created by aliens and is only a natural landform , is because in the last paragraph,paragraph twelve, they talk about how the the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. Since the landform shows a butte or mesa, that means that the image was a major landform that came from the American West. Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" He also said,"" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, this is not only a natural landform, but a major natural landform.

I do agree a little bit about aliens creating the face. Maybesomewhere in space, there are aliens that created something else or not. One day maybe we can find something out in space that has something to do with aliens, but today is just isn't the day to do that. But overall, i would have to agree that aliens did not create this, but this is only a natural landform created by something other than aliens.

As you can see, this creative landform was most defintley not created from aliens, but just a nice natural landform. Scientists now figured out that this ""Face on Mars"" is from shadows and not from aliens. This landform is actually a butte or a mesa which is very intersting to have found out. Many people did belive that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, but scientists haven't found out if there are aliens or not, so we shouldn't jump into conclusion. But overall, this face was defintely a landform and not created by aliens!!",0,persuade_corpus,,7
0DB421BA1BFD,"The education system is always adapting to fit the wants and needs of students and finding ways to improve students' learning. One way that the education system has adapted and improved is through distance learning, which is online classes. Many schools offer online classes to students, who can either take online or in school classes. Students benefit from these online classes because it eliminates their need to commute between home and school, they do not have to miss class due to illness or inclimate weather, and they can learn at their own pace in an environment that is comfortable for them.

Students who attend classes at home do not have to commute between home and school, which is a benefit because that helps save gas, since the students would not be making a round every time they have class. This not only saves gas, but also time and money, since students would not be traveling as much or using up as much of their gas. Online classes also eliminate the possibility of being late to class for any reason. For example, students who attend regular in-school classes may be late due to traffic caused by a car accident, for students who attend online classes, they would not have to worry about this situation occurring.

Another benefit of distance learning is that students can still attend class even in the event of inclimate weather or illness. Many schools are currently using this advantage, due to the coronavirus. Several schools have already switched to online classes, so as to avoid spreading the disease without having to cancel classes altogether. Other schools are planning on implementing online classes as well due to the coronavirus. Schools have also used distance learning during times of inclimate weather, such as substantial snowfall, so that students did not miss a day of learning. Many schools districts are implementing snow programs, where if school is canceled due to snow or other inclimate weather, students can still learn and not have to make up for the missed day or days later on in the year.

Online classes allow students to learn at their own pace in a their own comfortable environment. This is a benefit because not all students learn at the same pace or the same way. Some students are auditory learners, while others are visual. With online classes, students can learn how they want, an auditory learner can take a class that involves video conferencing, while a visual learner can take a class that includes PowerPoint with notes. Also students are in their own environment, so they can have a music playing or not, or be in bed or at a desk, they are not limited like students in a classroom are. Also, with online classes, students can take care of their work at any point during the day, unless its a video conference class. This helps students who have busy lives, for example, a mother who is returning to college may take online classes, so that she can do her work at night, instead of being in class during the day, when she needs to get errands done. Many universities offer online classes for that reason, their online college classes are designed to be flexible and work with people's busy schedules.

Some can argue though, that distance learning does not benefit students for reasons such as lack of internet, lack of interaction with teachers or other students, or lack of being able to monitor whether the student is cheating. However, these reasons can be argued against. For example, if a student lacks internet, online classes are optional, so they can opt out of online classes, or they could get internet, by either buying wifi or going somewhere with wifi. Also, online classes have video conferencing, so students could still have interaction with the teacher and other students, and the students can easily communicate with the teacher through email if needed. Also, measures can be and are put in place to prevent cheating, for example, the end of course test for online classes are usually held in a normal classroom setting at a school and certain sites used for schools do not allow students to leave it while in the middle of an assignment, such as powerschool.

In conclusion, distance learning offers students many benefits. Distance learning allows student to eliminate a commute to school every class, does not prevent them from attending in the event of illness or inclimate weather, and allows them to learn comfortably. Students benefit from online classes, so more schools should implement distance learning, especially for during winter, when there are consistent school closings due to snow. ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
E0656353B8F2," The concept of a three-year high school program is a topic that has been debated for years. While some argue that it is beneficial for students to have the option to graduate early, others believe that completing four years of high school is crucial for success in life. In this essay, I will argue that schools should not offer a three-year high school program and that it is important for students to complete all four years of high school.

Firstly, completing four years of high school provides students with the opportunity to receive a well-rounded education. High school is designed to prepare students for college and the workforce, and a four-year program ensures that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in both areas. A three-year program, on the other hand, may not provide students with the same level of education and could leave them unprepared for the challenges that lie ahead.

Secondly, most colleges look for students who have completed four years of high school. A three-year program may not be recognized by colleges, and students may miss out on important scholarships and opportunities for further education. Additionally, students who graduate early may not have had the same level of exposure to a variety of subjects and may not be as well-rounded as those who completed four years of high school.

Thirdly, a three-year program may not provide students with the same level of support and resources as a four-year program. High school is a time when students need guidance and support from teachers, counselors, and other mentors. A three-year program may not provide the same level of support and resources, and students may miss out on important opportunities to receive help and guidance.

Finally, a three-year program may not provide students with the same level of personal growth and development as a four-year program. High school is a time when students are exploring their interests and developing their skills and abilities. A three-year program may not provide the same level of personal growth and development, and students may miss out on important opportunities to learn and grow.

In conclusion, schools should not offer a three-year high school program. Completing four years of high school provides students with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in life, is recognized by colleges, provides students with the necessary support and resources, and provides students with the necessary personal growth and development. It is important for students to complete all four",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

    - It is important to have access to teachers, counselors, and librarians to help students succeed

66F03584BCA5,"Should people make their own decision, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters ? Some people value self reliance and feel the need to follow their own instincts and ideas. Although these people are confident and trust themselves,I believe people should ask for advice from their parents and other professionals before making important life decisions.

First of all, most people respect and value their parents. For example, when I consider getting another job,I like to discuss my options with my parents. They help me look at both the good and bad things about different job. They bring up things that I may have not thought about. Their advice help me make better decisions. I appreciate their knowledge because they know me very well and want the best for me. Therefor, I thing It' is important to ask for their guidance in these matters.

Secondly, I would ask not only my family, not also my teachers when I make decisions about my education. For instance, after I graduate from high school and earn my diploma I will ask my teacher about the possibility of going to a community college or taking extra classes to help me get a good job that will make me happy and provide me with skills make so that I can live a better life.

Our brains are hardwired to make split-second decisions about people and situations, so these first impressions can be the result of any number of factors such as socio-economic status, gender, age, or physical appearance. To counteract this, it is important to take a step back and consider these snap judgments in a larger context. Consider the possibility of being open minded and looking for evidence to support or contradict initial impressions. Additionally, taking the time to really get to know someone can help to form more accurate impressions that go beyond first glance.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Analyze the reasons why first impressions are not always accurate and how to counteract them.,9
B8757E80EB9D,"Venus can be a scary planet when it comes down to its features. The writer to this story certanly convinced me that we should not study Venus anymore. We have tried to land spacecraft on the planet before, but none have last no more than a few hours, so how are we supposed to study it when it just keeps destroying our spacecrafts. We haven't tried it again in a decade. The reason to this is that Temperatures vary around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has a thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide. If us humans even take a step on Venus we get crushed. Venus has a 90% atomic pressure, which is greater than what we have on Earth. It could even crush a submarine and those are supposed to outstand pressure from the ocean. Venus isn't a very pretty planet either, it has a familiar features as valleys,mountains, and craters. We could use spacecraft to hover over venus about 30 miles or so above it. Even if we did that we couldn't take sample rocks or gas. Are technology gets better throughout the years, so maybe one day well figure a way out to oustand that heat and pressure. Even if we do that though, what would be the sense if we cant even live on the planet. Half of the stuff we use today will never outstand the heat or pressure that Venus has. Including phones,cars,and houses. This shows you that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
falcon_180b_v1_173,"I believe that there should be stricter gun control laws in our country. The reason for this is because of the increasing number of gun-related incidents and crimes that have been happening lately.

Firstly, stricter gun control laws can help reduce the number of deaths caused by guns. In countries where there are strict gun laws, such as Japan and Australia, there are significantly fewer gun-related deaths compared to countries with more lenient laws like the United States. This shows that having stricter laws can make a difference in saving lives.

Secondly, stricter gun control laws can help prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. For example, people with a history of mental illness or criminal records should not be allowed to own guns. By implementing stricter background checks and waiting periods, we can ensure that only responsible and law-abiding citizens are able to purchase firearms.

Lastly, stricter gun control laws can help reduce the number of mass shootings that occur. In recent years, there have been numerous mass shootings in schools, movie theaters, and other public places. By limiting access to certain types of guns and ammunition, we can make it harder for individuals to carry out these types of attacks.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that there should be stricter gun control laws in our country. By implementing these laws, we can help save lives, prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, and reduce the number of mass shootings that occur. It is time for our government to take action and prioritize the safety of its citizens.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"The issue of gun control is a highly contentious one in many countries.

8283155E54A0,"The Ancient Greek storyteller's advice not to waste any act of kindness is a piece of wisdom that has stood the test of time. The reasons behind this advice are rooted in the belief that every act of kindness has the potential to make a significant impact on the world. In this essay, I will explore the reasons behind this advice and provide examples of how small acts of kindness can make a meaningful impact.

First and foremost, the Ancient Greek storyteller's advice not to waste any act of kindness is rooted in the belief that every act of kindness has the potential to create a ripple effect. This means that even the smallest act of kindness can have a significant impact on the world. For example, imagine a person who sees a homeless person on the street and decides to buy them a meal. This small act of kindness may not seem like much, but it can have a significant impact on the homeless person's life. They may feel seen and valued, which can lead to increased self-esteem and a sense of purpose. This, in turn, can lead to a better quality of life and even help them get out of their current situation.

Another reason behind the Ancient Greek storyteller's advice is that small acts of kindness can create a sense of community and belonging. When we do something kind for someone else, we are creating a bond with them. This bond can help to foster a sense of community and belonging, which can be particularly important for people who feel isolated or alone. For example, imagine a person who sees a neighbor struggling to carry their groceries and decides to offer to help. This small act of kindness can create a sense of community and belonging between the two neighbors, which can help to build stronger relationships in the future.

Finally, the Ancient Greek storyteller's advice not to waste any act of kindness is rooted in the belief that every act of kindness has the potential to create a better world. When we do something kind for someone else, we are helping to create a world that is more compassionate, understanding, and empathetic. This can have a significant impact on society as a whole. For example, imagine a person who sees a bully picking on someone and decides to intervene. This small act of kindness can help to create a world that is safer and more inclusive for everyone.

838093B60075,"Imagination is the driving force behind innovation and creativity. It is the ability to envision possibilities and ideas that may not yet exist. While knowledge is important, it is not as essential as imagination. In fact, imagination can often lead to new knowledge and understanding.

One example of this is in the field of math. While knowledge of mathematical principles and formulas is important, it is imagination that allows us to apply those principles in new and innovative ways. For example, Albert Einstein famously said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world."" This quote highlights the importance of imagination in the field of science and mathematics.

Another example is in the field of building and construction. While knowledge of materials, engineering principles, and building codes is important, it is imagination that allows architects and builders to create structures that are both functional and beautiful. Without imagination, we would be limited to building structures that are only practical, rather than structures that are also works of art.

Finally, imagination is also important in the field of design. Whether it's designing a new product, a piece of clothing, or a piece of furniture, imagination allows us to envision possibilities that may not yet exist. Without imagination, we would be limited to designing products that are only functional, rather than products that are also aesthetically pleasing.

In conclusion, imagination is more important than knowledge in many fields. While knowledge is important, it is imagination that allows us to apply that knowledge in new and innovative ways. As Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world."" By embracing our imagination, we can create a world that is both functional and beautiful.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,3
2FEA75A93DBB,"In my opinion I think that this ""Face on Mars"" is a landform. For one, we have never seen an alien or have any trace of aliens. I think that we think it has something to do with aliens because it is in a face shape like us. But honestly, huge rocks or huge meterorites could have caused it to look like that. Also there hasn't been any sight of life on Mars because of the conditions. If humans couldn't live on Mars, then how could aliens?

Huge rocks and huge meters crash into the planets and moon all the time. I honestly think that it is the rocks or something in space that caused this. I don't think that there is any sight or any posssible way that there could be life or aliens on this planet.

When they went to go see again and go check out the ""Face on Mars"" they didn't see anything, there was no alien monument. They also talk about how it is very hard to be able to see the ""Face on Mars"" I think that if there was a possiblity that it could be a bout aliens and this ""Face on Mars"" appeared because of aliens then there wouldn't onlly be one face. I think that if there were tons of face looking landforms then maybe there could've been life on mars for aliens. Since there were no other faces that could've been another alien, I don't think that there is a way that this has anything to do with aliens.

It also states in the passge that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. He states that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids that you would be able to see them.

If you could make things larger and see farther into the picture than I think there would've been more to find. There wasn't any other sign of aliens found in the picture. I think aliens for sure having nothing to do with this, but at the same time they could have.

I think if scientists really were able to go and see this i think they should study the face more often to see if there is any evidence of any other alien or any other landform that has to do with them. My personal opinion is that it has nothing to do with aliens.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
llama_70b_v143,"Standardized testing has been a big part of our education system for a long time. But are they really accurate? I don't think so.

First of all, standardized tests only measure a narrow range of skills. They focus mostly on multiple choice questions that test our memory and basic comprehension. But there's so much more to learning than just remembering facts and figures. They don't take into account important skills like critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. These are the skills that we need to succeed in real life, but they're not reflected in standardized tests.

Another problem with standardized tests is that they're often biased. They're usually made by people who don't understand the experiences and backgrounds of all students. For example, a test question might assume that all students have access to a computer at home, but that's not always the case. Or, it might use language that's not familiar to students who are English language learners. This means that some students are at a disadvantage before they even start the test.

Furthermore, standardized tests put too much pressure on students. They're often used to determine important things like graduation, college acceptance, and even teacher evaluations. This makes students feel anxious and stressed, which can affect their performance on the test. It's not fair to judge students based on one test score, especially when there are so many other factors that can affect how well they do.

Finally, there are better ways to measure student ability. Alternative assessments, like project-based learning and portfolios, show a more complete picture of what students can do. These assessments allow students to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in a more meaningful way, and they're often more engaging for students.

In conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. They only measure a narrow range of skills, they're often biased, they put too much pressure on students, and there are better ways to assess student learning. Instead of relying so heavily on standardized tests, we should focus on alternative assessments that show a more complete picture of what students can do.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The use of standardized testing in schools has been a topic of debate for many years.

A4FD67097CFD,"Computers are something of the present, and man-kind is hoping for more efficient computers in the future. More and more lately students are being assigned a computer of their own supplied by the school. Sometimes these computers are used for bad but mostly good. The Facial Action Coding System could be helpful for furthering academics in school corporations and could be used to help state testing which has just recently been switched to online.

The Facial Action Coding System is something that school should invest in. It should not become something that everyone needs to have because some schools cannot even afford books! For the schools that can afford this program it could be made beneficial many different ways. For example, many students become tired using their computers, so if the computer reads the child is becoming tired it could offer an academic game or a brain teaser to make the child more lively. The article states, "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts.' Then is could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" This program can also read happiness and sadness. Some students suffer from depression and have thoughts of suicide. This program could notify the teacher or counselor if the student is continuously sad or angry. This could help prevent things such as school shootings, self mutilation, or even suicide.

Some people may argue this program is taking away from a teachers job or is could be used for the wrong things. Technology has taken the load off of teachers in the last ten years, but it has also caused some harm. With technology comes the problems of students not having their computers charged, money shortages, and things breaking. Those things have distracted from students learning. In the big picture, do the pros outweigh the cons?

In the overall outlook on furthering a student's computer's capability using this program is the better option. Everything comes with problems. It does add something more to a teachers plate, but it also helps a teacher make a connection with the student. The Facial Action Coding system is beneficial and should be considered by school corporations around the world. ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
996C6D34FAE1,"Have you ever been forced to participate in something you didn't want to? Well, that's exactly what this principal has decided to do with all of his students. Kids are expected to do so much in twenty four hours, go to school, do homework, go to sports, eat, and manage to get at least eight hours of sleep every night. Kids have lives outside of school that no one at school really knows about. You can't predict that a student goes home after a long day at school and wishes they had something to do. Some kids barely get enough sleep every night. For these reasons I believe students shouldn't be forced to participate in extracurricular activities.

Every day students wake up and go to school for seven hours whether they like it or not. Some kids don't like it, they don't like the environment of school and all they think about is when they can go home. So why force them to stay longer, they won't be happy so no one is winning. For the students that like school, and wouldn't mind staying a couple hours later and participating, let them do it. It should be their choice. If they think it would be fun, let them do it. But, if home is the only place where these kids feel safe, let them go home. Kids deserve to go home and relax after seven hours of school five days a week.

In addition, say a student really wishes they could participate in an extracurricular, they may not have the time to. With only twenty four hours in a day kids are expected to sleep for eight hours, go to school for seven hours, participate in any sports they might have, come home and do hours of homework, eat dinner, try to spend time with family, and go to sleep at a decent hour. As if that's not enough try adding an extracurricular activity into the mix, there's not enough hours in a day. But, not everyone has that packed of a schedule so for those people that could stay after for a little and kill some time, let them. It should be their choice and their choice only. Not the principal's who has no idea what a student's life is like after the last bell rings.

In conclusion, kids have so much going on that the school doesn't know about. Some students really don't like school so why are we forcing them to stay longer than needed for something that could just make it worse. You can't expect every student to want to go to school every day let alone commit the time into staying longer and doing something ""fun"". Even if they wanted to, there may not be enough time left in the day for that to happen. Students already have enough stress as it is so why put even more on their plate if it won't help them succeed. Kids that do have the time and want to participate in these can and should be able to. Because of these reasons, I believe that students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities.     ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

953BEF800163,"Finish high school one year early sounds pretty good. Students can start doing something out of high school that helps them in the career they will choose in the future. But, its better to finish the traditional four years in high school, because students can prepare more they self before go to college, its too early for students to finish high school at the age of 15-17 years old, and students might not have the enough education that they need.

To begin with, students will be more prepare to go to college after the four years of education from high school. They can prepare more they self and see what they need to work on or what they wanna do in the future. For example, these four years in high school helped me to find a passion about what I would like to become in the future, and also helped me to be more mature and feel ready for the next step.

Also, its too early for students to finish high school one year before, because students might be in the age between 15-17 years old and they may not be that ready to start a responsive life in college. For example, my sister is 16 years old and she's a junior. When we don't have nothing to do or we are having a conversation, I always ask her if she is ready to go to college or at least, if she have an idea of what major she would like to study and her response is that; she's not even ready for her senior year, and I understand her, because that happened to me when I was her age and when I was a junior.

Moreover, students might not have the enough education that they need to learn in high school, and that can be a problem in their classes in college. For instance, I've heard from some friends in college, that sometimes they really lost in some classes, even though they graduated from high school when they were 18 years old. That means, if students graduate in three years, they would be confusing in their classes when they're in college.

To conclude, graduate in four years from high school it feels longer, but it will be a big reward at the end, because students will be more ready to go to college, also they will be in an age where they will be more responsible, and mature.

In 2018 there were 1.6 million crashes annually from cellphones and driving. Cellphones are the lead factor that's caused accidents. Many accidents come from teens using their phones while driving. For an example they can create dangerous, and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident .For this reason cellphones should not be used while driving.

One reason why using phones and driving because when bad accidents takes instance people or teens lives.

they are also ruining people life like making people can't walk again, forget how to do things like walk, and, eat. Lots of people diening because of these cellphones calls or messages.

your cellphone can wait until you get to the place to see what the notification is. Caused too many car crashes to happen.

when teens phone are in the car and they get a notification. Teens are so anxious to see calls or sent a text.

Therefore, they should ban the cellphones completely while driving for the safety of everyone. When teens try to do two things at once. Multitask caused its them to have an accident quicker than a regular accident. Whatever the emergency, always wait until they stop or get to their destination.

My answer for teens is tempted to text and drive therefore they should not use cellphones while driving. Or have a phone in their surroundings.

First impressions are like, super important, right? Like, you know when you meet someone new and you instantly decide if you like them or not. But, can those impressions actually change? Like, can you go from thinking someone's weird to thinking they're awesome? I think so! 🤔

Okay, so there's this one time when I met this new kid in my class, Jake. And at first, I thought he was really weird. Like, he wore these crazy glasses and had this awkward laugh. But then, we started talking and I found out he's actually really cool! He's into the same music as me and he's got this awesome sense of humor. So, my first impression of him was totally wrong! 😳

4312BE04F2B3,"picture this your just about to leave a long day of school, but then you remember you have to go play a sport that you dont even want to play , because you were forced in to it well that's what this principle wants to do. You should not be forced into anything you dont want to do its not fare. Who has the right to say I should and should not do with my free time. Plus it would put too much stress on the kids and you dont even know what in there free time, besides it's just unconstitutional to say all kids must do extra out-of-school work.

First off, you dont even know what kids do in there free time. Some kids skate,or cook you know hobbies and your taking there hobbies away from them. Most things you cant do in school like cook ,or skate and they would never get approved. some kids would prefer to skate than throw balls around. Some kids do chores or yard work when they get home, so if there not home to do them then it will never get done. Do you see the problem here if the chore dose not get done the house will look trashy. Im just saying some kids get exsersize by pushing lawn mowers. I myself gained most of my muscle from mowing lawns and walking to school

Second of all, this all can be very stressful. Keeping up with a sport and school can be very stressful. if you dont know working out and doing home work dont really match up too well. It can be stressful focusing on two things. It could even affect ones mental health . If a kid is not in the right mental head space and loose a lot it can make them feel depressed and make and them feel worthless. I mean teen suicide has been increasing over the years bet this example and a few more things like bulling could make a man go mad.

Its very unconstitutional to say some one must do something ,in this case make them do a after school activity. Its like taking ones amendments . Saying must is like communism your basically saying we dont have a choice. Kids should have a say in what they want to do with there life . Not every body wants to play a team sport ,some people find more enjoyment in solo games. If a kid dose not want to play in school who cares let him be. The constitution say that we can do any thing we want unless its harming people and hes saying I must do this that dose not sound very patriotic now dose it.

Some people might say ""kids need excersize"" well this is true for everyone and my response to that islet them dig there own path let them take life how they want if they just want to relax the entire time let them do that. Let them control there life let them enjoy it. If you want to take life one step at a time go head be you. Dont let some one tell you your to lazy.

I dont see the reasoning behind his idea . I should not be forced to do any extra work that i dont want to do. They dont know what I do in my free time I dont know what they do in their free time lets keep it that way. It would just stress the kids out and no one wants that .

I'm talking about playing the violin, cooking different kinds of foods, and even doing makeup. I know, I know, it's a lot, but I'm just really curious and I want to try it all out.

First off, let's talk about the violin. I've always been fascinated by how musicians can make those beautiful sounds come out of their instruments. It looks like magic!

A222836421FE,"What do you do when you need advice? Many people tend to ask others such as their friends, family, teachers, etc. The real question is, should you ask only one person for advice or multiple people? Asking multiple people for their opinions can help you make a better choice as people have different views and beliefs, personal experience in what you want advice for, and you have different people telling you their opinion so you can consider the best option.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, because many people have different views and beliefs. Nobody is the same, and the world is a very diverse place. Many people are biased, and if you were to ask somebody who is biased for advice, they would give you their personal opinion which could be on the far right or far left of the spectrum. Everybody was raised different. Some grew up in poverty, some rich, and some in segregated communities. The way you were brought up is also a factor to your opinions and asking just one person may affect your decision based on their opinion.

The topic you need advice on may have also happened to other people. People have personal experience in some of the same topics, and that's why it's good to seek multiple opinions. Tragic events happen to people everyday, and that's a factor in what can affect people's opinions. For example, women who have had a baby may have a different opinion than a childless woman. People are also very educated. If you needed advice on a medical topic, it would be best to go see someone who has a degree and is experienced in the field. If you were to go to your friend who self-treated them self, he or she may tell you something completely different than an experienced person in the medical field may tell you.

Multiple people telling you their opinions gives you a wide range of options to consider as they all have gone through different things in life. If it's a personal topic, it's best to ask many different people from different races, religions, and others as you'll hear many different opinions and maybe even hear something you've never thought about that you may consider.

Overall, it's best to ask multiple different people their opinions on a topic you need advice on. By doing that, you'll hear many different opinions and it'll give you a long list of options to consider as you are hearing opinions from people with different views and beliefs, personal experience, and from people who may be completely different than you.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

By: STUDENT_NAME

I think that students should perform a community service because it would make our community stronger and bring us closer together in the things we do. Some things we could do are cleaning up liter and making our Earth healthier. Also we can throw our garbage away instead of throwing it in the streets or on the sidewalk and if we see a person do it, we could tell them to pick it up and throw it out or we can throw it out for them if they don't throw it away.

Another thing is our community can make a garden and plant vegetables, trees, flowers and other things. We can do that for helping families in need and we can actually help them too. Also, we could recycle our paper, cans, and cell phones or ink cartages. If everyone recycles, our Earth would be a lot cleaner and we wouldn't have to worry about having a dirty Earth.

Our community can also donate to homeless families and families that live in shelters and that would need things for their family or themselves. We can give them things like, clothes, toys, food, make up, blankets/sheets and other things a person would need. Everyone needs someone to take care of them and look out for them and they always will need someone there.

The community we live in could be a lot stronger and healthier if we all just try together. It takes a lot more than one person. It takes hundreds. If we just try it together, it'll work.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

I believe that social media has had a significant impact on societal norms and values. Social media platforms, like Twitter and Instagram, have become a huge part of our culture and daily lives, shaping the way we interact with one another.

One of the ways social media has impacted society is by influencing our behavior. For example, people often post pictures and videos that show them engaging in risky or dangerous activities, like extreme sports or daredevil stunts. This can create a ""culture of thrill-seeking,"" which can encourage others to take more risks and engage in similar activities.

Another way social media has impacted society is by changing the way we communicate with one another. We can now easily connect with people all over the world, sharing information and ideas quickly and easily. This has led to a more connected and informed society, but it has also created new challenges, like the spread of fake news and online harassment.

Finally, social media has also had a significant impact on our mental health and well-being. Studies have shown that excessive use of social media can lead to increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. This is because social media often creates unrealistic expectations about our lives and our relationships, which can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and inadequacy.

In conclusion, social media has had a significant impact on societal norms and values, influencing our behavior, communication, and mental health. While there are certainly benefits to social media, it is important that we are aware of these impacts and take steps to mitigate any negative effects. As a young person, I believe we need to take responsibility for our own use of social media, and work to create a healthier, more positive online culture.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"The impact of social media on society has been a topic of ongoing debate.

A24A28C64B6B,"Getting up in the morning is hard to do.

High school students have it the worst because they have to get up at 6 in the morning just to get to school on time. Who wants to get up that early? If a student has work or any after school activity, they wont be able to get school work done because the're too tired at the end of the day or just dont have the time. Students that are home schooled or take an online class are able to make time for school work and it's not as much of a hassle. Bullying is a big issue going around in schools and most students that are getting bullied dont wont to go to school because they are scared. Having the option of letting them take it online would help them not be as stressed about school and be more thrilled to go. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they wouldn't have to wake up early, it's an alternative if they dont feel safe at school, and students would feel less stressed.

Students, especially teens, hate waking up early in the morning to go to school. Studies show that students should be getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Most high school students, however, get 4-5 hours of sleep each night because of homework and after school activities that keep them up all night. Students drink coffee or energy drinks to keep themselves awake even though its not good for them and if they drink too much it could hurt them. Students can only have a certain amount of absences and tardy s before they have to go to summer school which no kid wants to do. Having classes online would help students get the recommended amount of sleep each night.

Bullying is a big problem in most public schools today. Students that are getting bullied dont want to go to school because they are scared of what the bully is gonna do to them. Even if they go and tell a trusted adult there is no telling what the teachers gonna do or if the bully is gonna stop. Most of the time when someone is getting bullied all the school dose is suspend the bully for a couple months and thats it. Some extreme cases of bullying have led to the student harming themselves or trying to take there own life. Having online classes at home would help the students that are getting bulled feel less scared and learn better.

Having school at home or online wold help the students not feel as stressed. Going to school each day tired is already hard enough on students, but now they are getting even more stressed out because of homework for different classes. If students wanted to take AP or IB classes they couldnt do anything else because those classes are very time consuming. Students couldnt have a job or have anything after school if they take an AP or IB because of the amount of stress they would be going through. Having online school would help fix that issue and allow students with the opportunity to take those hard classes.

Going to school helps students make friends. School is the number 1 place where most children and teens make friends and meet people and if they taking the classes online, they dont get the chance to experience that. If a kid doesnt have very much social interaction then they become very anti social and not have a whole lot of people skills. Staying at home and taking classes online has its benefits but actually putting in the effort to wake up and come to school everyday and meeting new friends is worth coming to school for. If a student stays home and takes an online class they really dont have anyone to ask for help if they dont understand a topic.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they dont have to wake up early, it is an alternative if the student doesnt feel safe at school, and they would be less stressed. Taking classes online are safer because you're in the safety of you're home and they wouldnt cost as much money as it would being at a public school. Overall, online classes would be a big help to students who are struggling to come to school. Lets start making this a reality then!                                                                                           ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

Should you be using your phone while driving a vehicle?

I'll tell you reasons why you shouldn't use your phone while driving. Then, I'll explain to you what can happen to you if you use your phone while driving a vehicle. Afterward, I'll tell you the kinds of consequence you can receive from the situation. Finally, I'll give you examples of why it's a bad idea of using your phone while driving.

Should you be using your cellular device while driving a vehicle? In my opinion you shouldn't use your phone while driving. You shouldn't use it because you can get distracted easily. Never know what can happen you might pass a red light and cause an accident. Phones shouldn't be use for texting nor calling but you can use it to get somewhere. In case you don't know where it is you can use your gps but that's it.

Reasons why you shouldn't use your cellphone. To begin with it's against the law to text and drive. Secondly, you can cause an accident you never know what can happen when you don't pay attention. You might pass a light or someone might be crossing the street and you won't be able to see that person. You're putting others people life in danger.

In this paragraph I'll tell you about the type of consequence you can get. It is illegal to use your phone while driving. You can receive a monetary fine which can range from $20 up to $500 depending on the state. Also can be charge as a criminal charge. In some states using your phone or texting while driving can be a result in criminal misdemeanor charges. Lastly, you can be in jail or prison time if your injury another driver or another human.

Example why you shouldn't use your phone. First thing first you can cause an accident. You put your life in danger and other people's life in danger. You assume that you will have it under control but you never know what can happen any second. Also you might hit another car or pass a red light. These are reasons why not to use your phone. You can take an innocent person life and if you survive you will have pain inside you.

Finally, I believe you shouldn't use your phone is for the best. If you don't you don't have any risk on putting people life in danger. Everyone would be safe and no accidents would occur. Phones shouldn't even belong on your hand while driving. Unless you need it to get somewhere.                            ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
C51C5EA029D6,"Character Traits: Self-Decided or Formed by Outside Influences?

As an 8th grader, I have often wondered about the nature of character traits. Are they something that we decide for ourselves, or are they formed by outside influences beyond our control? In this essay, I will compare and contrast two different views on this topic.

On one hand, some people believe that character traits are entirely self-decided. According to this view, we have the power to choose our own values, beliefs, and behaviors, and these choices shape who we are as individuals. For example, if we want to be kind and compassionate, we can make a conscious effort to act in a way that is kind and compassionate, and over time, these actions will become a part of our character. This view suggests that our character is like a mold that we can shape and mold to our liking, as long as we are willing to put in the effort.

On the other hand, there are those who argue that character traits are largely formed by outside influences. According to this view, our environment, upbringing, and experiences play a much bigger role in shaping our character than we might realize. For instance, if we grow up in a family that values honesty and integrity, we are more likely to develop these traits ourselves. Similarly, if we are surrounded by people who are kind and compassionate, we are more likely to adopt those traits as well. This view suggests that our character is like a sponge that absorbs the qualities of those around us, and it is difficult to change who we are without a significant effort to do so.

While both views have valid points, I believe that the truth lies somewhere in between. While it is certainly possible to shape our own character through conscious choices and actions, there are also many external factors that can influence who we are. For example, if we grow up in a culture that values punctuality and respect for authority, we may find ourselves inheriting those traits without even realizing it. At the same time, if we surround ourselves with people who are kind and supportive, we are more likely to develop those traits ourselves.

In conclusion, character traits are likely the result of a combination of self-",1,llama2_chat,Task: Research and compare two different views on character traits - deciding character traits for oneself versus character traits being formed by outside influences.,4

If there is only a small group of people than it would not be a good way to have the work done. Please consider this and if you don't like this than it will be fine to me. My other reason is not everyone would like to pick up liter. It might not be what students want to do during there free time.

F44D5A636C2F," The human experience is one that is shaped by the environment in which we find ourselves. It is a world where we are constantly surrounded by impressions, both positive and negative. From the first time we meet someone to the way we present ourselves in a job interview, our impressions of others and of ourselves can have a significant impact on how we are perceived by those around us.

It is easy to fall into the trap of judging people based on their first impressions. We often make assumptions about someone based on their appearance, mannerisms, and demeanor. However, it is important to remember that first impressions are not always accurate. People can change and grow over time, and it is possible to form new impressions based on new experiences and interactions.

For example, I have met people that I once despised, but who have since become an important part of my life. They have become my family, and I am grateful for their presence in my life. Similarly, I have had job interviews where I was initially judged based on my first impressions, but I was able to prove my worth through my eagerness, charisma, and other qualities.

It is also important to remember that our own impressions of ourselves can be just as important as the impressions others have of us. We often present ourselves in a certain way, whether it be through our clothing, manners, or other aspects of our appearance. However, it is important to be realistic about ourselves and not to try to present an image that is not reflective of our true selves.

In conclusion, the environment in which we find ourselves is one that is shaped by impressions. It is important to remember that first impressions are not always accurate and that our own impressions of ourselves can be just as important. We should strive to be true to ourselves and to judge others based on their actions and character, rather than their initial impressions.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

8EA275CFABF8,"Imagine a world when all you see is people sitting in their cars and not paying attention to the road ahead of them. That seems very scary to me. I believe that driverless cars are not a good idea or the way to be going for the future. Driverless cars could lead to many fatal accidents and also many injuries.

My first argument is that technology always seems to fail. When you get a new iPhone, sometimes not everything is right in the phone or something is messed up from the start. If we had driverless cars in the future, technology would be the key function to make the car work. What if the technology failed like what seems to happen many times to iPhone users. I think having driverless cars is putting too much belief and risk into technology. You can never say when a problem would quickly approach or is about to happen, it just happens. If a problem just happened in a driverless car when the driver wasn't paying that much attention to the road, many accidents and fatalities would be on the rise.

In conclusion, I think the idea of driverless cars are very unique and out there, but as of right now and the technology we have, I could not put my full trust in a driverless car. Today, the technology and sensors needed for a full driverless car seem very unrealistic. Sensors created for the driverless car would be tested many times, but if it fails when it isn't being tested that can cause too much harm for everyone and everything in the world around us. I believe that we should stick with normal human driving for the safety of everyone.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

I personally beilieve that it wold be best to have somehing that has been woked on by many people and can be very well depended on. These days no one can tell ho someone fels because of their facial expression. so in my essay will be giving evidence that supports whymi am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions.

Secondly, my evidence that supports that i am for the value of using this technology to read students emotionl expressions is in the text where it text states "" The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thoma Huang, of the University of illinois, working in collaboration with prof . Nicu sebe of the university of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"". from this evidence i can definenly defend and give evidence for why i am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. from tis quote i am for the value of using tthis technology to read students emotionl expressions because their are many people many universities who combind their knowlege and what they know together so off couse they would come up with something so great. by something so graet i mean humans, technology and emotions. What i can also personally add to this parrgraph is things are way more depenable and understanding and way more better and trustfull and when many people join their heads together.

Thirdly, another evidence that supports that i am for the value of using this tehnology to read students emotional expressions is in the text where the text states "" The process begin with the computer model of the face .....then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. paul eckman......for example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle ......"" . from this evidence i should already know that i am for this technology and i agree with it being used to read students emotional expressions. I agree with it being used to read students emotinal expression, because just from the first four words of the quote i know that is is definently dependable .I know from those four words in the begining of the quote that this passage tells me everything that i need to know about this technology. It also leaves me without worries and question but the need to use it.

Fourth, another evidence that i can use that supports why i am for this the quote ""The software is the latest innovtion from "" just from this quote i can support why i am foe the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions because i no that what ever company or what so ever this project will definently be graet and will as much as it is expected to do great. Another reason why i am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions is the text states ""While looking at the mirror :......1....2...3...... does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?

Can your lab partner recognize which one........accordig to facial feedback....."".

Also this quote "" Who ever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotion! from this quote i can say that people can't just understand your emotions and how you feel because of your face expression so that is wy their is a need for a technology that is thrustfull and has been developed with so much knowlege to help with all that and the curiusity of how someone feels from their facial expression.

To conclued i would definently say that i am for the valueof using this technoogy to read sudents emotonal expressions. This technogy is the latest technology so i can count on its new developments. This techology has been created by many developers many universities, many proffesors so am for sure that they made it the best that it should and needsto be.

In Vauban,German the suburb is going ""carfree"". Rosenthal speaks about how Vauban allows cars but there are only two locations where they may park these cars. If you want to park your car you must buy a space for 40,000, and a home along with your parking space. Due to these facts 70% of Vauban families do not own a car. An advantage of this limited car usage is that people like Heidrum Walter speak about how she is much happier and less tense without her car.

Vauban is in an area that is more accessible to public transportation and closer to stores. The closeness allows people easier accessablity to buses, or walking and biking places. With everything close its easier to get to point A to B. Also reduces pollution and greenhouse gases due to the fact they aren't using cars to get to there locations.

In Source 2 Duffer, speaks about how in Paris bans are being placed against the usage against cars, due to the fact Paris has a high level of smog. Paris had motorists with evennumbered license plates on Mondays leave there cars home or suffer a fine. On Tuesday motorists with oddnumbered license plates were to leave cars home or suffer a fine. The advantage of this ban is that having so many people leave there cars home on Monday allowed the smog to clear enough that the ban for Tuesday was rescind. If Paris were to do this ban for a couple of years there smog issue would be completely gone. This would be a major advantage for them, it would give them less pollution, not as many people getting sick due to the smog, and a less car dependent city.

An event was created in Bogota, Colombia called A Day Without Cars. Which was to have people go carfree for a day. Colombians used many other transportations such as biking, buses, and hiking. This event allowed smog to be reduced due to the fact Colombians could not use a car this day or be fined. Also this event helped spark other areas want to pertake in this event. This was a huge advantage having many other places join A Day Without Cars this meant more areas helping reduce smog and helping many more areas become aware of the fact cars dont have to be the only form of transportation people use.

All in all if areas become less car dependent, there shall be less smog, pollutions and lastly people wont have to travel as far due to the fact everything will be closer. The smaller amount of cars we have, the more positive outcomes.",0,train_essays,,9
AEF788DA28DE,"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that participating in school sports has numerous benefits for students, and therefore, the school should not change its sports policy. In this essay, I will argue that participation in school sports promotes physical health, social skills, and academic achievement, and that these benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks.

First and foremost, participating in school sports has numerous physical health benefits. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), regular physical activity can help prevent chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, physical activity can improve cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength, and flexibility, all of which are essential for overall health and well-being.

In addition to physical health benefits, participation in school sports can also help students develop important social skills. Being part of a team can teach students the importance of teamwork, communication, and cooperation. It can also provide opportunities for students to make new friends and build strong relationships with their peers.

Finally, participating in school sports can have a positive impact on academic achievement. According to a study published in the Journal of School Health, students who participate in school sports are more likely to have higher grades, better attendance, and higher test scores. This is likely due to the fact that participating in sports can help students develop discipline, time management skills, and a strong work ethic, all of which are essential for academic success.

While there may be some potential drawbacks to changing the school's sports policy, such as increased costs or a lack of resources, these benefits far outweigh any potential negatives. In conclusion, I strongly believe that the school should not change its sports policy, as participation in school sports promotes physical health, social skills, and academic achievement, and these benefits are essential for the overall well-being of students.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,2
2DF86580B7E7,"Foremost, the electoral college is a process used for selecting a president through the popular vote of qualified respesenators. The electoral college was established by our founding fathers, and still benefits us today. Using trusted representatives and efficently casting the desired vote, the electoral college is the best method of selecting a president. The electoral college allows the country to be sure of an outcome, and no one region can elect a president on its own.

Electoral votes are cast by electors chosen to represent each state, these electors are ""...trusted to vote for the party's nominee..."", stated Richard Posner. This means that electors are trusted and qualified to efficiently represent the vote their state desires. The trust set upon electors is ""rarely betrayed"" Posner said. The last time an election was won by someone who didn't get the popular vote was in 2000, and this doesn't happen often. This is contrary to what was said by Bradford Plumer. Plumer stated ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.""

The electoral college gives America certainty of an outcome, without a tie, or a run-off election. The ability to rest easy knowing there will be a clear winner is an ability given to America, by the system of electoral votes.  A tie occurance in an election is ""Highly unlikely..."" Posner said. Even though most states use a ""Winner-take all"" basis, ties and run-off elections are still extremely rare and unlikely.

Swing states- a debated and popular issue amog the electoral college. Swing states are often paid more attention and given more information than regular states. While being paid more attention, the swing states together are able to determine the election's outcome. Though small states don't get much attention, they still have a say in the election.

For example, they can talk to their parents, guardians, friends, trusted adults, or even people you don't know!

First of all, if a student wasn't at school for a couple of days and his or her friend was. The student can ask his or her friend for advice on what they missed or how to do the homework so they can make it up. The student may ask multiple people so he or she can get the best result. The student may be able to help other students that were also not at school on that day.

Second, people on the streets could help too. If a person went on a trip to Hawaii and got lost, he or she can ask different people about the directions to their destination. He or she can ask, ""How do I get there?"" or ""What is the fastest route?"" They can put those answers together and get to their final destination easy and fast.

Third, if someone is playing video games with their friend and doesn't know how to complete a challenge. They can ask their friend and the friend can help complete the challenge. He can give different way to do it or the easiest way to do it. After all the help he got from his friend, he could share with his other friends, and it would just keep on going until everyone knows.

Last but not least, if someone went to the store to get groceries and wants the best price, he or she can ask the people who work there or other people at the store. They can also go to different stores and compare prices. They would not have everyone's opinions and can get the item they want at the best prices.

People use smartphones so much that it can become a distraction. A big distraction is while driving people start using their phones and put themselves and other drivers at risk. Texting and driving is a big distraction putting people in harm's way because people cannot do two things at once and most accidents occur because of texting and driving.

Cell phones can be a big distraction in the world. Most people get addicted to their phones that they can't live without them. People need to have their phones on them all the time. When they get notifications they have to look no matter what they're doing. When they get a notification while driving they get distracted so now they're not focused on the road that puts them and other people in danger. Cell phones distract people from the road which may lead to an accident. Some people think they can multitask by driving and texting but that's not the case.

Multitasking is a hard thing for human beings. Even if you think you are multitasking the human brain can only process things one at a time. While people are texting and driving they are only focus on one thing so they can crash at any moment because they're not focused on the road. This puts everyone in danger. This is why states have put strict laws so that people wouldn't text while driving. This is why texting while driving is a leading cause for car accidents.

When it comes to car accidents, most of them occur because the driver was distracted.

Most likely they were using their phones. It was reported that, "" A distracted driver is a motorist that diverts his or her attention from the road, usually to talk on the cell phone, send a text message or eat food."" As it states most accidents are because of cell phone distraction this is why they made laws to try and stop texting while driving. Right now this is the leading cause for car accidents and we have to try and prevent it from continuing.

Texting and driving should not be permitted anywhere as it distracts the driver putting everyone in danger. All this causes people to die or get severely injured this is why people need to put their phones down for a while and focus on the road. This way we have a safer environment for everyone.

E69E62149A87,"Hey there!  So, I'm supposed to write about John Lubbock and his cool stuff, right? 

Okay, so John Lubbock was this British naturalist dude who lived like, a long time ago.  He was born in 1834 and died in 1913.  He was into science and stuff, and he wrote a bunch of books about nature and stuff.  Like, he discovered that plants grow faster in warm weather and stuff.  And he also studied the moon and stuff. 

But here's the thing, he wasn't just a naturalist.  He also became a politician!  Like, he was a member of Parliament and stuff.  And he used his knowledge of science to help make decisions about stuff like, agriculture and stuff. 

So, what's the deal with him being both a naturalist and a politician?  Well, I think it's because he was able to use his own unique perspective to make a difference.  Like, he wasn't just following the crowd or whatever.  He was like, ""Hey, I know stuff about science, let me use that to help make the world a better place!"" 

And that's so cool, right?  Because it shows that when you're able to be yourself and make your own choices, you can make a real difference.  Like, if more people were like John Lubbock and didn't care what others thought, we could have a lot more cool stuff happening in the world. 

So, yeah. That's my essay.  I hope you liked it.  Oh, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask!",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Research the life of the British naturalist John Lubbock and his major accomplishments which lead to him making his mark in the political world. Analyze the impact that making his own decisions had in his ability to become a successful politician and naturalist despite the fact that there were not many British politicians who were also naturalists. Finally, evaluate how having the freedom to choose your own characteristic traits can impact one's ability to create a unique difference and make a mark.",6
ECA4D673EC46,"""From the moment a person is born, they are entitled to the right to choose."" Loathing going to an extracurricular activity is no fun feeling for young scholars. I strongly disagree with the decision of having every student participate in an extracurricular activity because it can problems for other activities they do outside of school, takes away their ability to choose, explore and find new hobbies, and can effect a students academic performance.

A large percentage of students have something extra going on outside of school and adding onto it wouldn't be okay. For example, student who has to work to help their family is already taking on a lot. They have school life and family to think about. If a student were to be forced to choose an extracurricular activity, that would put more stress on them to keep up with said activity and the life they already have. Another example would be if a student has to take care of younger siblings or sick family. Having to go to that activity would force the student into a corner where they can't take care of their family properly. The parents may not have the time or money to get a caretaker or to it themselves. Last of all, it could change how much time a student has to themselves. Having time to rest and do something fun is necessary to keep from being too stressed. Less time to rest means the scholar can feel more stressed and could effect their moods.

Young scholars need to experience having a choice in what they do so they can explore themselves. Young students thrive off the ability to choose when they are given a choice.

Making a student choose may cause them to lose the curiosity of finding new things on their own.

Scholars would lose interest in the activity they have had interest in later in life if they had discovered it themselves. Activities like playing sports, helping with the year book or being on the council will put unnecessary pressure on the student to make choice they didn't want to. Extracurricular actives give students the opportunities to find themselves but if they are forced to make that decision to quickly, the point of it all is lost and they may feel trapped .

Academic performance is the most important part of adolescences school life. For instance, students who need to do extra studying and work to keep their grades up will lose that time. That activity will take up more time in their lives and force them to put down the book more often. That will deifnelty make a students grades suffer depending on the activity. This could effect a scholars ability to get into a dream collage. When I students grades start dipping because of an activity, the collage they want to go may reject them because of that. Hearing that they didn't get in may put them in a position where they have to settle for a collage that won't help them with their future goals . Lastly, students who do sports may have to give them up because of their grades. This will cost them scholarships and big opportunities in their future. For some students, that could be detrimental to their future because not all families can afford collage fees.

I adamantly disagree with the unfair decision of scholars having to be in an extracurricular activity. It can problems for other activities they do outside of school, takes away their ability to choose, explore and find new hobbies, and can effect a students academic performance. The negative effects in will have in their future are too risky. ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
9FB06FEFCDAE,"This article was stating that Venus is Earth's ""twin."" It is the closest in distance as well. Venus has many things wrong with it before anyone could ever live on it. Venus could be our nearest option for planitary visit. There is Earth like qualities but, it is very dangerious. Scientist still study this world because they know that if they could have a landing that was successful then they could finaly really start to explore the suface.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth. At times we may be closer to Mars do to the speed at wich the planets spin but we are usually closest to Venus. Many spacecraft have been sent to Venus trying to learn more of it but each time that it has been attempted, it has only been able to last a few hours before failing. Venus is a challenging planet to be studied.

Venus has many issues but there is profe that there may have once, long ago, been covered with oceans and had plenty of adaptable life on it. Today there are still some places on Venus that have Earth like features. Land forms that look the way Earth's do. There are valleys, moutains, and craders.

Though it is true that Venus is closest to us and may be the best otpion for visitation one day in the future it still has many problems. The planets surface area is an avaerage of 800 degrees Farenhheit. The atomic pressure is 90 times as much as Earth. At this point in time Venus is enhabital. There must be more reasearch allowed on Venus to find out if anyone could ever step foot on it.

Venus must be researched more to learn as much as possable if it is said that it is the most livable planet. It has many dangers, yes, but that is the vary reason it needs more attention. The more time spent on reasearching Venus the more likley that we will be able to maybe reverse the effect to make it look as it did those any a years ago when it had bodies of water and valleys.

Driveless cars are the new idea being brought into car manufactoring to possibly help and chane our world. The upmost new technology will be involed making the cars ""smart"", safe, easy to use, and ""fun"".

I believe it will be a great idea to continue this development, just for the wait to see how this being apart in humans lives would effect us. This will be the new thing and because of the change tat is coming to our world, know one knows the effects that could occur with the models being out and about in the world.

These models could possible create conflicts that should be handled before these activities are amongst the everyday human life. In the article, the author explains how laws are more towards the drivers and not the cars. Now with driveless cars, the decisions should be disscussed now on new lawmaking before they're out and about.

0A273CDFC416,"Several people in the United States do not participate in extracurricular activities. Most of them sit at home, play video games, and don't do much in the community. They basically only come in contact with other people at school. But what if these activities where required? Required extracurricular activities would allow them to be communicating with other people all the time, not just at school. I think required extracurricular activities are a fabulous idea because they build friendships, keep students active, and progress social skills.

First of all, after school programs let you see your friends and possibly make new ones. This will help strengthen the relationship between you and your friends. Also, when participating in extracurricular activities, you meet all sorts of new people. I know when I played basketball, I met several new people from other schools, and I know a lot of the players from other schools now. It got me in public more often, and that's better for you than staying home watching screens all day.

Secondly, I think that extracurricular activities are good for keeping people active. For example, if you chose basketball as you after school activity, you would be running in practice, going up and down the court during games, and that would lead you to getting in better shape. They would also stay active in the community, because several of the activities involve people in the community. Things such as sporting events would involve crowds of people coming to watch and support their teams. In addition, being active and playing sport would help lower obesity, which is starting to be a problem in some schools. The running and jumping, and just getting up and doing things after school help you lose weight.

Thirdly, these activities would build social skills, as being out in public surrounded by other people force you to talk, and slowly build social skills. Social skills are used for everything in life, from making friends to getting a job. They are extremely useful for doing anything in life. Going back to making friends, these skills will make it a million times easier to do so, because communication would come naturally, and you would seem more friendly. And since most of these activities involve being in the community more often and meeting new people, it doesn't hurt to have this particular set of skills..

Lastly, I believe that I have proven that required extracurricular activities are useful, productive, and better for you than laying in bed or watching television. They develop friendships, keep you active, and produce social skills. Making friends in life is important, and after school programs help you make some lifelong accomplices. The social skills you learn might help you get a future job, and will most definitely help you with life in general. I hope many people view required activities differently, and will see the reason behind them.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
falcon_180b_v1_939,"""I personally believe that video games can contribute to violent behavior, but not in all cases. There are a few reasons why I think this way. 

Firstly, many video games involve violence and aggression as their main components. Players often have to kill or harm others to progress in the game. This can desensitize individuals to violence over time and make them more accepting of it in real life situations.

Secondly, some players may become so engrossed in the game that they blur the line between fantasy and reality. They may start to see violence as a viable solution to problems they face in their own lives.

Lastly, studies have shown that there is a correlation between playing violent video games and increased aggression. A study conducted by the University of Missouri found that children who played violent video games were more likely to engage in physical fights than those who did not.

However, I do acknowledge that not all gamers exhibit violent behavior. It is ultimately up to the individual to distinguish between what is acceptable in a game and what is not acceptable in real life. Therefore, video games cannot be solely blamed for violent behavior, but they can contribute to it.""",1,falcon_180b_v1,"There is an ongoing debate about the impact of video games on behavior.

82F7210163B5,"When learning at school with other students who cause distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends and they feed you it sometimes is hard for a student to show up to school or even learn.

For me I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. Another reason is that some students could live far from the school making it hard to get to school everyday. Finally students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home.

Students could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate.

Some students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school everyday. Some students can't catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught.

Finally students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. Also teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level.

Although going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.",0,original_moth,Task: Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of learning in a classroom setting and in a home setting.,3
A9E9851F3E7E,"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While it may seem like a convenient option for students, there are several reasons why students should not attend distance learning classes from home. In this essay, I will explore the implications of distractions, homework struggles, and financial issues that come with distance learning.

One of the main reasons why distance learning is not a viable option for students is the distractions that come with it. When students are learning from home, they are often surrounded by distractions such as family members, pets, and household chores. These distractions can make it difficult for students to focus on their studies and can lead to a decrease in academic performance. Additionally, students may be tempted to use social media or engage in other activities that are not conducive to their studies. These distractions can be minimized in a traditional classroom setting, where students are expected to focus on their studies and are surrounded by other students who are also focused on their studies.

Another reason why distance learning is not a viable option for students is the struggle with homework. When students are learning from home, they may not have access to the same resources as they would in a traditional classroom setting. This can make it difficult for students to complete their homework assignments and can lead to a decrease in academic performance. Additionally, students may not have the opportunity to ask questions or seek clarification from their teachers, which can further complicate the homework process. In a traditional classroom setting, students have access to their teachers and classmates, which can make it easier to complete homework assignments and seek help when needed.

Finally, distance learning can also be financially burdensome for students and their families. When students are learning from home, they may need to purchase additional resources such as textbooks, laptops, and internet access. Additionally, students may need to pay for transportation and other expenses that are associated with attending school in person. These costs can be significant and can make it difficult for some families to afford distance learning. In a traditional classroom setting, these costs are often covered by the school and can be more affordable for students and their families.

In conclusion, while distance learning may seem like a convenient option for students, there are several reasons why it is not a viable option for many. The distractions that come with learning from home, the struggle with homework",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,3
2C0A4D88629E,"Dear principle,

I believe policy 2 is a good choice for a cell phone policy because we didn't come to school to talk and gossip with our friends we came to learn. When most people use there phones, or text there usually talking bad about other people, and hurting there feelings behind there back and not telling them. That's were most people get hurt and verbally abused by who they thought were there close friends, but found out that there not and I think that school is the one place that cell phones should not be aloud to be used. All these fancy electronic devices like i pods cell phones and i phones are just distractions and ways to talk to people without actually talking but you will get in trouble if you get caught texting someone during class. So i believe that schools should keep people from having phones at school because some people came to learn and get smart and don't want the distraction of a phone keeping them from learning or doing a good job on tests, quizzes, and home work. Even though i have a cell phone and would like to talk to my friends with out other people hearing its best to leave them at home or off in your locker to avoid getting them out during class and getting it taken away. That is what I believe should be the schools cell phone policy because phones are unneeded in a place you are learning at.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

Programs such as intergenerational activities and peers mentoring systems can be useful in developing relationships among students. Through these activities, older students can help to teach and guide younger students in various aspects, including but not limited to, academics. 

Sports are often an overlooked component when discussing the importance of older and younger student interaction. Besides the physical health benefits associated with sport, student also gain an understanding of team building, communication, problem solving and respect. Through sports, younger students are able to learn these qualities from their older peers and mutually build relationships. As such, it is clear that sports hold an important role in a program promoting interactions between these two generations.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

1863E4D44B5F,"The electoral college is seen both hated and favored by many Americans. Some believe that the electoral college is an efficent way of reciving a effective president and should be continued to be utilziled in America, and others (In comparsion with me) agrees that the electoral college should be thrown out allowing voting to be more of an ""equal chance"". The vote really doesnt count if your electors of the state dont come to the agrrement of the president you would want  In the electoral college  Secondly, who are the electors?  And lastly who pics the electors? this is the curicumstances of having the electoral college.

First off, the vote really doesnt count if your electors of the state dont come to the agrrement of the president you would want. In the elctoral college the citizen of that particular state vote for the president of their choice. Afterwards it would be up to the number of electors that pledged for that particular president would earn the runners a number of votes that the state has based on their population. The method used for selecting a president maybe effiecent but not correct. It maybe faster and easier to caluclate but which would you rather have? An not so good president that was choosen by some elector. Or a vote based on what the entire country feels. Not off what a certian side of the country are most likely to do.

Secondly, who are the electors? Although these electors are trusted and rarely betrayed, how would we know if it was betrayed during this certian election? What if almost more than half of the electors in every state was influenced,forced or was to ""betray"" that would be an serious issue the elction of that particular presdient. This is one of the many questions in having a electoral college. The electors can be influenced by the other electors. which cannot be good for our country. these type of decsions should be made by everyone in the country not 12, 45, or 44 elctoral votes. The electoral votes were in the constitution from long ago. These type of systems worked better because the technology wasnt as advanced, but now it is. Why continue on whats already worn out, and out of date?

Lastly, how are the electors choosen? Because of not always being able to control who their electors of the state choose for it really isnt accurate. If electoral college was and ""correct"" way to choose the presdient, then why arent they publicly annocunced? How do the people who selelct the eletors? which brings up the possiblilty of the electors have a strong bias belief in democrats/republicans. all together the electoral college sounds fishy, if everyone voted on their perosnal opionion there would be less choas on how the president was selected.

Although anachronism may seem like a tradtion in America, that worked when it was created and continues to work now, there are quite of few down falls of this system. things are different now, we (America) should adjust to the times we are living in. What worked then may not be the best possible choice due to the advancements that we nw have in america. We should be free to vote for our president directly, not through some system that is almost acient. The vote really doesnt count if your electors of the state dont come to the agrrement of the president you would want  In the electoral college  Secondly, who are the electors?  And lastly who pics the electors? This is the curicumstances of having the electoral college. Maybe soon the country will see the differnce.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

The Electoral college consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for the president vice president an the counting of the electoral votes by congress. thew number of electoral college consists of 538 electors. majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Why do the state of senator wish to take away electoral college votes? because they think there is to much voting bc under the electoral college system voters vote not just for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. but who pick the electors? who are the electors? the electors can be anyone that not holding public officean they pick the electors by the state. that how voters sometimes get confused about electors and vote. But the outcome of all this is that electoral college vite is possible an its less likely to dispute over the popular vote. A electoral vote is possible because the total number of vites is 538 is an even number. So to rap it all up it can be argued that the electoral collge method of selecting the president may turn off pontenial voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. so state senator i think we should keep the electoral college.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
B462DD2E5524,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

The policy for participating in school sports or activities should not be changed because keeping a C average is hard enough. You may not think that we try our hardest in our classes and at school but i know for a fact that all students at least try. If many students in our school already have a C average, you already know that there will not be many students participating this year so, why even think about changing the policy? I am writing this letter to you for all of my classmates. You know that the students in our school are working to keep their grades up, therefore not disappointing any teachers, especially parents.

My suggestion for you is that you keep the policy we already have because we try our best to show you in class that we are good students, who work hard for what they do. As I am writing this letter to you, I know that you will at least think about my choice. Being a student in your school, a former athlete, and knowing what most 8th graders can do, keeping a B average is a very hard thing to do.

I want to thank you for your kind consideration and the time you took out of your day to read this letter. I really hope that my thoughts in this new policy affects your choice and changes your mind.

Sincerely,

In German Suburds 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move in the German Suburb. They would sell thier car(s), and live without a car, and live a less stressful life. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two. I'm sure Heidrun wasn't the only one who felt like that.

Having no car wouldd take more stress of your life then you think. You wouldn't have to pay a car payment every month. You wouldn't have to worry about hvaing to pay for gas to get around. Lastly you wouldn't have to worry about getting into a car accident every time you got behind the wheel of a car.

""All of our development since World war ll has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" said David Goldberg. Goldberg is right. We put most of our attention and development into cars, and focus more on them than we really should. We don't really realize what damage cars are causing us yet, and probably won't realize for a long time from now.

Aftrer days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with even numbered license plates were orded to leave thier cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. The same would apply to odd number plates the following day. They should not only be doing this in Paris but everywhere to reduce the air pollution. The fine should be higher also to those who don't follow the rules. Unless you havea real emergency to use your car the day you are not suppose to then don't use it.

Not using cars would be a huge problem solver to most of us. It will help with air pollution. It will help with finacial problems by not having to worry about car payments or money for gas. Lastly it will help wiith the stress in people's lives and lower it.             ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
1F463E41607A,"Driverless cars aren't a new topic to the automotive world. They weren't as advanced as they were now, but now they're much more advanced and more practical. Since we're in the modern era I can fully understand why people just want to hurry to make cars that drive themselves, but it just doesn't seem very practical. Driverless cars would have more faults than benefits to the road.

People just want to upgrade everything without seeing the faults in evolving. For example, the car still needs a driver to manage it, so why do you need to upgrade if it doesn't even fulfill its own namesake? The limited automotive use really just puts the driver at more risk, because of the possibility of a malfunction. On that note since the cars are lined with high tech equipment, and whatnot wouldn't the accident in that kind of vehicle be more severe? Something could explode, and injure much more than the drivers. This also would make one of these cars far more difficult to replace as it states in the article. With it being filled with sensors, and other high tech equipment this could lead to 100's of thousands of dollars being thrown out the window for repairs.

In the end the benefits of having a driverless car are outweighed by the faults.

The call is still pretty tough, since the idea is still underexplored as a whole. For all we know the problems could get worked, but manual cars won't become obsolete. Manual cars still retain the more benefits in my mind.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
llama_70b_v1652,"Driverless cars are a bad idea. They sound cool and all, but once you really think about it, its a bad idea. First of all, they might be driverless, but that don't mean they're gonna be free. These cars are gonna be super expensive, and who's gonna be able to afford 'em? Not me, that's for sure.

Another thing, these cars are gonna take away jobs. My dad's a truck driver, and if these cars take over, he's gonna be out of a job. That's not right. People need jobs to support their families, and these cars are just gonna make it harder.

Plus, these cars are gonna be like computers. They're gonna break down and crash all the time. You ever had a computer crash on you? It's the worst. Now imagine that happening while you're driving. Not good.

The author of the article says that driverless cars are gonna be safer than regular cars. But that's not true. They're gonna be programmed by people, and people make mistakes. There's gonna be bugs in the system and stuff. It's not worth the risk.

And what about when the cars have to make hard decisions? Like, if there's a crash about to happen, and the car has to choose between hitting one person or another. That's not something a computer should have to do. That's something for people to decide.

I know some people are gonna say that driverless cars are the future and all that. But I don't think that's true. We don't need cars that drive themselves. We need cars that people can drive. It's just better that way.

So, in conclusion, driverless cars are a bad idea. They're gonna be too expensive, take away jobs, and be unsafe. We don't need 'em.

ED0A8E614649,"Techonology has becoming powerful that let students and teachers to give and receive classes online. Disadvantages or adventages of taking classes online? These question are faced today by students deciding taking online classes. Often students work part or full time jobs while going to school or collage so their time is valuable. these students want to make the right decisions in choosing classes so knowing the disaventage and adventages is important. I believe that online classes is a good opportunity for students as it gives flexibility, they often offer any type of class desired and provide access to faculty, and they often offer accelerate courses.

To begin with, one of the best adventage of online classes is flexibility. A student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. While there are custom essay writing and researching assigments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the student's desire. Students who work are able to take the class based on their schedule. Many students work on afternoon. The flexibility makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending school or collage courses in person might be imposible due to their work schedules.

Secondly, another great adventage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. Distance learning course are often avaliable from a number of collages. A person can simply use the google to find a class. While most people believe a disadventage of taking online courses is that the students can not have access to faculty a member, the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty. Shy students are able to ask questons and receive the answer back almost inmediately.

Lastly, Online courses are convenient for most undergraduate and graduate students who can study when they want and they can finish writing or researching assigments based on their own person schedules. The fact is online classes offer flexibility and conveniece that are often vital to students who work and have families. In addition, many students are looking for classes that are advanced to complete the course faster. The best way to advance in the class is to make it online because in the regular schools it takes a long time as there are students who get behind and the teachers wait for them since everyone has to go at the same time.

To conclude, with online classes, students do all the work at their own pace. As long as they meet their deadlines and participate apropriately online. Also, studying online requires more self motivation and time mangement skills because students will spend a lot of time on their own without someone physically close to keep them focused on deadlines. Online course will not only teach students geology or poetry, it will also help them become more self motivated, a trait that will make them stand out in the workplace and beyond. It will teach educators to be mature choosing right decisions as it will make them explore more and be students with an open mind.         ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
8034A75C0798,"Cellular phones are not to be used in the driver seat. In this essay, I will explain how drivers should not be able to use cellular phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. People in the world today are glued and stuck to their cellular phones because of this world being technology driven. Cellular phones are now smart phones, literally walking computers.

That's wonderful in its place; however, putting your life and others lives in danger while using cellular phones while driving is the issue of today.

The numbers showing the danger of cellular phones used while driving a vehicle are very scary. In fact, at any given time throughout the day, approximately 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their cellular phones while behind the wheel of an automobile, and 3,328 people were killed during the year of 2018 which was the most during 2018- 2020.

A vehicle needs your undivided attention because you are not driving for yourself, you are driving for others. People get very distracted by things such as texts, calls, or even music. In my opinion, this generation cannot multitask so they put their mind on one thing and stick to that. This is usually the cellular phone and not the road while driving the vehicle.

In my conclusion, life is more important than a text or a Direct Message when driving a motor vehicle. We shouldn't just think about ourselves, but think about other drivers on the road, and help everyone get back home safe and sound to their loved ones.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

But it's not a good idea just asking your problem or question to one person.

825C7DDC0008,"Summer vacation is what every student looks forward to throughout the school year. Many students plan to go on trips with their family or friends for months at a time, but are limited to the three month vacation. The last thing a student wants to worry about over break is getting school-work done.

But in order to make sure that students don't forget whatever they learned during the nine months that school was in session, teachers assign a summer assignment or project.

Although student-designed projects would be liked more by the student, teacher-designed projects are meant to follow the criteria of the course and make sure that the assignment is reasonable, while student-designed may only cover one-fifth of their learning. But a student-designed summer project lets the teacher see what kind of student are taking their class, their level of creativity, and what the teacher needs to cover.

It's the teachers' job to teach students so that they can be successful in whatever they chose to study in college or universities. It's their job to ensure that the student has learned the standard learning criteria and maybe even more. Teacher-designed assignments are made to make sure that the students have some idea of what the course will be like, so that on the first day of class, students can engage themselves in the discussion. For example, if a student decides to take a new course that they have never taken before, they must have some background knowledge when coming to class on the first day. A summer assignment will help them figure out what they should already know coming into the first day. Students are not aware about all they information they need to know, and if they design the project themselves, they could miss majority of the information, so it's important that the teacher designs the project, even if it's a lot of work, it will be beneficial for the student in the long run.

The main thing teachers are trying to do is help guide students on their path of success, but only if the student complies. The point of a project is to let students explore a topic that the teacher can teach themselves, but a hands on experience can better the students' learning. If students in the class decide to create their own different projects, they won't all be retaining all of the information that is required to get out of doing the project and some projects might not be relevant to the topic. For example, if a chemistry teacher decides to create a project for students to learn about Intermolecular Forces and wants the students to learn about Dipole-Dipole, Hydrogen Bonding, London Dispersion Forces, and gives the students no rubric so they chose how the project will be done, some students will find all three forces and learn a lot, while others may only find one or two, and worst comes to worst, students didn't even follow the directions and created their own project separate from the information given. This is important because the teacher will end up having to teach the students what they missed in the project which will take out of class time to learn other things.

As much as students dislike the thought of school during summer vacation, they can't let all of the hard work and studying they did throughout the school year go to waste because they ""don't feel like"" doing any work. But that's where summer assignments come into play. Summer assignments are designed to help the student stay familiar with what they learned. Teacher-designed projects are good because it makes sure that the student learns everything correctly, however a student-designed project allows for the teacher to get familiar with the students work habits, and so the teacher knows what they need to go over within the first weeks of school. For example, if a student is signed up for a computer science class, for the summer assignment, the student gets to chose what they want to do, as long as it is coding related. There will be various projects, some will be fully developed programs, which will show the teacher that the student has coded before, and some will be a short code that can calculate a user's input. This is important because it's gives students a chance to be creative and to show the teacher that they are ready for the class in the fall. Also it can be fun for the students to create something which will make them want to complete it.

Teachers have gone through school just like their students to be able to help even more people become successful. Teachers only want the best for their students, so when they assign something it will always be beneficial to the learning process. Even if the assignment is very hard and long, teachers are there to provide help when needed. Teacher-designed projects may benefit more than student-designed projects because it follows a strict rubric on what should be the outcome of the learning experience. While student-designed projects become something that is disorganized and uses up more class time than it should. But students may appreciate the projects teachers assign if they got to have a say in what the rubric is. If the teacher and students come to an agreement, it can increase the students participation and make the project learning time more enjoyable. Ultimately, teacher-designed projects benefit the time spent and the amount of information received, with the help of student input, the participation from students will have a greater impact on the learning of the students.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
426B322D25DA,"Dear Principal,

You should allow students to have cell phones in school because if we have something after school we need to stay at, our parents may remind us. If we had an after school activity canceled, we could text or call our parents and ask them if we should ride the bus or if they will pick us up from school. We students should be able to have cell phones in school and use them during free times and lunch as long as we don't abuse our privileges and we don't use them during class. If our parents need to pick us up early from school, need to tell us to ride the bus or they are a car rider, our parents can text or call us to tell us that after they tell the front office, that way we'll be ready when they get here or to go to the buses. If we want to go home with a friend on their bus, we could call one of our parents and ask them to call the front office to tell them we're going to ride a different bus.

We should be able to have phones on school but turned off during classes. If we have our phones turned on in class and our parent tries to call us, our ringer may go off. As long as we have the ringers and noises turned off that would be fine as long as we are not texting. If a student drops and breaks their phone, they can't try to sue the school because they weren't being careful or they don't have a case for it.

BE4764F7BFF1,"In recent years, online learning has become increasingly popular, especially in the K-12 sector. While online classes have their advantages, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. In this essay, I will analyze the potential pros and cons of students taking online classes from home, especially in K-12.

One of the main advantages of online classes is the flexibility they offer. Students can attend class from the comfort of their own home, which can be especially convenient for those with busy schedules or who live far from the school. This flexibility can also allow students to learn at their own pace, as they can watch lectures and complete assignments on their own schedule.

Another advantage of online classes is that they often offer a wider range of courses than traditional brick-and-mortar schools. This can be especially beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing a specific subject or career path that may not be available at their local school.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to online classes. One of the main concerns is that students may struggle with self-motivation and discipline. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may be more likely to procrastinate and fall behind on assignments.

Another potential drawback of online classes is that students may miss out on the socialization opportunities that come with attending school in person. This can be especially important for younger students who are still developing their social skills.

In conclusion, while online classes have their advantages, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. Ultimately, the decision to take online classes from home should be based on a careful weighing of the pros and cons, and should be made in consultation with parents, teachers, and other relevant stakeholders.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0
49F5B4EA2690,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is a system that the United States has been using to elect its leaders for many years. A large number of people have come to believe that this method of voting is fraud because not everyone's vote is truely heard. The way the Electoral College works is every four years when people go to vote, people are not actually voting directly for their desired leader, but for a state elector. Although this sounds like it would work flawlessly in theory, in some cases the number of electoral votes have overridden the number of popular votes.

In the 2000 election between Bush and Gore, Bush ended up winning even though Gore received more popular votes. The nation did not know who the President was going to be until the next year becuase the election came down to only a couple of hundred votes. Although this is a rare occurance it shows how easily the Electoral College can wrongly choose a President. If the United States elected a President by taking a popular vote, this issue would not exist. All of the extra systems that are put in place are simply not needed.

If the Electoral College was removed and the United States voted in leaders based on the national popular vote, this means that there would also be more people voting. Many people, especially in one sided states such as Texas and California, believe that their vote does not count becuase they're state is guarenteed to favor one party every election. If the Electoral College did not exist then knowing that every individual vote counts and that it does not matter where you live, more people are actually going to listen to what candidates have to say and are going to go out and vote.

In Conclusion, although the Electoral College may sound good in theory, I believe that the United States voting system would be more legitimate if a national popular vote was taken so that everyone's voice is heard no matter where they live. Voters should be able to know that they're vote will count so that the right leader is chosen for the right reason.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
C40BB9E0BC6C,"Should success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

l agree with what Churchill's about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Failure is to do or perform. l agree because some people think that if you are failure it mean you can not be success, you will be success no matter what. Some people preform good in ever where they go and do what will make they there success so this is important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success without loss of enthusiasm.

First reasons, ln the world people will say that failure don't make they life by success so if they did something and they fail that all, they will never try it again because they did not get good thing from the fist one. Be strong in everything you are doing failure will not be without loss of enthusiasm. For example My brother wife have an exam to write in the morning so she was learning all the night she did not asleep so l went to her room and tell her to sleep some time before morning and she said no l have to learn so that l can pass me exam and l said OK then am going to sleep. ln the morning she get up and she went to write the exam. The next day they call her and told her that she fail her exam so all what she was thinking was that she will pass the exam but she will failure so she was thinking that she will be success in this exam but she did not loss of enthusiasm.

Also, Most of the people give up if they fail in thing they are doing they believe in them self that what they are doing will be successful for they but the end thing will miss up for them and the loss of enthusiasm the good ideas of bring success tell your that l can do this and do it all. For example, l was write am SOL exam last year and l don't know what to write and l don't understand what the question is say so l was thinking about the question but l don't know what to write so l tell my self that no matter what the question is l will do it and pass it. When the score came because l believe in my self l pass the exam. So you can be success in every thing you do if you made up your Maine in what you are doing. Make your self a good discuss and you will be fine.

However, Some people start their own business but they first tell them self my business will be successful and yes they will be because they believe first before they start the business. Yes the work will be good without loss of enthusiasm. For example, My friend dad has a big shop in Generic_City one night when her dad was asleep some bad people came to the shop to take all his money and the thing in the shop so in the morning people was cry infant of the shop so we all went there l see what is going there so when we went there it was so sad they bad people took everything in the shop not even a pen but do know something he did not give up because he did not give up he fail but he was successful in what he was doing. The reasons why am telling all this is that never tell your self that l will be failure on matter what you will be success.

Other might say that it is bad ideas to be success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. However you can loss enthusiasm any time but if you never give up in what you are doing people do things that they don't believe in what they. One of my teacher in my school called Generic_Name gave as a test and the test was as difficult for as to do so he told him self how can the student do this work so try not to give the test to as the student in the classroom told him that we will can do the test so the teacher the told as that do you believer that you can do it and we said yes we can so he gave as the test to do. infant all the student that told that test pass successfully and the teacher was so happy. So you will be success without loss of enthusiasm.

ln contusion, We have many things in the world that will make you a failure or success, make a discuss to yourself that you will success in life no matter how how things will go. My friends always told me that never give up in life, school and any thing you do. Maybe you have an exam today and when you went home yesterday you did not learn and you was watch TV and you want to pass the exam no matter what you will be failure in the exam. ls important to be success in life if you can be success you have to do what will make you success. l believe in my self that being a success is a good idea.",0,original_moth,"Task: Research and answer the following question:

B0D9B3EA4E5A,"On May 24, 1976, NASA's Viking one spacecraft was circling mars. It took many photos of landing sites for its sister ship Viking two. As viking one took pictures, it came across a pecuiliar formation on the surface of the planet. The formation seemed to be an enormouse head similar to that of a humans. The scientist figured it was just another Martioan mesa, that was commonly spread throught the surface of Mars.

Conspiracy theorists think that it is bona fide evidence that there is life on Mars. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acncient civilization on Mars. And so on April 5, 1998 another Mars global surveyor flew over and took a picture ten times sharper than the original photos. This led the the scientist to conclude and reveal that the face was just a natural land form and that it wasn't an alien monument at all.

Some people were not happy. The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north of the martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. This was a coudy time of year on Mars. They had said that the camera the pictures had been taken with had to peer through clouds to see the Face. They believed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze at the time.

On April 8, 2001, there was a cloudles day on Mars. The surveyor drew close for another picture. They said they increased the image quality to take the best picture they had taken of the face. They added that in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixle size you could see things like airplains, egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks.

This showed people that it was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. This showed that the conspiracy theorists had been proven wrong. Since NASA actually researches theier data to learn more about it and they make hypothesize, it shows that they have a lot of since in saying that theorists are wrong. Theorist just make theories and they don't have anything to back them up if someone were to arugue about the subject.

The first reason I think driverless cars should be developed is because they cause less accidents. These cars cause less accidents because they are sensored causing the car causing the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine. These cars allow better resonse and control than human driver manage alone just from sensors and makes driving safer for people. The driverless cars also has vibrating seat belts when the vehicle is in danger of backing into a object. So this is the first reason why I think driverless cars should be developed.

The second reason why I think driverless cars should be developed is because they have far more flexibility than a bus. By developing driverless cars people dont have to worry about being late for work because the bus is too slow or is making too many stops. By having a driverless car people would be able to get to work,school,or anyother place they want to on time. People wouldn't have to rely on a bus that has to keep making stops when they can get where they need to be on time with this car. This is the second reason why i think driverless cars should be developed because they are more flexible than a bus.

The third and final reason why I think driverless cars should be developed is because it saves people gas money. This car would save people gas money because it uses sensors to function like to stop brakes, accelerate and steer. By this car saving people gas money they can use the money to buy things instead of spending alot on gas. So this is the final reason why I think driverless cars should be developed because they save people gas money.           ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

People that were raised in the twenty first centry thinks that there's something wrong with buses or taxies. I truly believe that there's nothing wrong with taking cars off the road for a day or so. Maybe we should try it.

Saving the planet by doing something minor wouldnt hurt anyone. ""It's a good oportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This is absolutely true because our enviroment is already gettin clogged up with bad air pollutions. Also, people stress about getting some where on time.""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Maybe, the United States should consider it as a campaign as of trying to teach younger kids that everything isn't just about having a car. Taking another transportation that doesn't consider your car will help you realize that you can go out and explore outside of your car. Cars shouldn't really be your frist priority.

Municipal authorities from other countries camt to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change."" Limiting car usage is like everyone who smokes cigaretts stop for a limited amount of time. Its a wonderful thing to do especially when its cutting down on bad pollutions in the air. ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to the highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" This is real selfish of the United States , this lets me know that even though we have our own transportation they dont really want to take care of the other transportations we have because they feel as if their not important to us. As far as I know a lot of people still rides buses,taxies,or even walk because they dont have cars. We should definetly take a day to leave our cars at home and get around by other transportations.

Cars aren't bad to have. They actually help in a lot of ways. We could always use a time to save the planet from pollution , accidents anything thats possible to happen in a car.

23b08b69,"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This idea is supported by various examples presented in the passage set. The German suburb of Vauban, for instance, has successfully implemented a car-free policy, resulting in 70% of families not owning cars. This has led to a happier community, with residents feeling less stressed and enjoying the tranquility of car-free streets. Furthermore, Vauban's experiment aligns with a global trend of separating suburban life from auto use, highlighting the increasing importance of smart planning and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars.

In addition to the positive impacts on individuals' well-being, limiting car usage can also significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a substantial percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By adopting policies that promote alternative transportation and reduce the dependence on cars, suburban areas can contribute to the global efforts to combat climate change. For example, Paris enforced a partial driving ban in response to high levels of pollution, resulting in a significant reduction in congestion and improved air quality. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can have an immediate and positive impact on the environment.

The success of car-free initiatives is not limited to Europe. Bogota, Colombia has implemented an annual car-free day with the aim of promoting alternative transportation and reducing pollution. This event has garnered significant participation, with millions of Colombians opting for biking, walking, or taking public transportation instead of driving. The positive response to this initiative highlights the willingness of individuals to embrace alternatives to car usage when given the opportunity.

The decreasing trend in car ownership and driving in the United States also provides evidence for the advantages of limiting car usage. Recent studies suggest a decline in both car sales and miles driven per person. This shift in behavior can have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment as transportation is a major contributor to emissions. Moreover, this change in behavior can be attributed to various factors, including advancements in technology that facilitate telecommuting and flexible commuting arrangements.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various examples found in the passage set. From improved well-being and reduced stress to lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality, there are numerous benefits to be gained from embracing alternatives to car usage. As cities and suburbs around the world adopt policies that promote smart planning and reduce dependence on cars, we can create more sustainable and environmentally friendly communities.",1,radek_500,,1

The author lets us know that "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with charactheristic of the facial muscles.""

I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions because the author gives a lot of detail from the texts and lets us know that ""the software can even identify mixed emotions."" It even lets us know that each expression is compared against a neutral face.

0161419B4ED0,"Texting and Driving

I believe that you shouldn't be able to text while driving because you are putting yourself and others at danger because you are no longer aware of your surroundings and can steer anywhere while you aren't paying attention. I understand that there are some things that need attention, but it's not worth the lives of innocent people. Nearly about 400,000 people die from texting and driving. 1 out of 4 car accidents occur from texting and driving and that's truly a shame. The average text sent takes the drivers eyes off the road for about 5 seconds and that's enough time to get into a life threatening accident according to SafeWise. com. These deaths hurt people mentally and physically and usually cause depression due to the fact that they lost a loved one to a foolish person. Some people don't even pay attention to the rules put in to place by the law and are seen constantly on the phone with someone.

These people deserve to get their license suspended and maybe even revoked because these people have no empathy for people who actually want to make it to their destination safely. The phone calls and text messages can wait because they aren't worth someone's life and it sure isn't worth going to jail for. Just wait until you reach you reach your destination to do these things. Keep this nonsense of the roads. The roads were meant for you to drive on not to text on. I think we should have some type of scanner to see if there are any active phones in use and if there are police or some type of authority should be alerted.

falcon_180b_v1_116,"I think that students would definitely benefit from being able to attend classes from home through distance learning. There are several reasons for my opinion.

Firstly, distance learning provides flexibility and convenience to students. They can learn at their own pace and schedule, which is particularly helpful for those who have other commitments such as part-time jobs or family responsibilities. This way, they don’t have to sacrifice their education for other important things in their lives.

Secondly, distance learning can save students a lot of time and money. They don’t have to spend time and money travelling to and from school, which can be a big burden for some students, especially those who live far away from their school. Additionally, they don’t have to spend money on expensive textbooks and other materials as most of the course materials are available online.

Lastly, distance learning can help students to develop important skills such as time management, self-discipline, and responsibility. These skills are essential for success in life, and distance learning provides an excellent opportunity for students to develop them.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home through distance learning. It provides flexibility, convenience, saves time and money, and helps to develop important life skills. Therefore, schools should consider offering distance learning as an option for students who want to attend classes from home.",1,falcon_180b_v1,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

c88db4ed,"Even though the Electoral College is known as a disaster factor, it has its benefits. The Electoral College is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. Each candidate running in your state has his or her own group of electors that are voted for. When you vote on election day, which is held every four years on Tuesday after the first Monday in november, you vote for the candidate's electors. Many politicians wanted to abolish the Electoral College because of its lack of democratic pedigree, but the college doesn't allow voters of other regions to feel disenfranchised, it avoids runoff elections, and thinks that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal. It would not be fair for a candidate to campaign heavily in a state that they know they are going to win. This does not gain them any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows will win. This causes voters that are from the opposite region to feel as if their votes did not count, that their new president would not care about their interests or values. The president would not really be their president because of the fact that they were ignored.

Voters that are more likely to pay attention to the campaign by listening to each opposing sides that compete against one another should decide the election. If voters that voted didn't care and picked the weaker candidate, then everyone would pay the price. The knowledgable voters listen to the competing candidates and will receive the most information and attention from the candidates. This leads to a candidate worthy enough to become president, which will choose the country's decisions for the next four years.

Runoff elections, where elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast is avoided. There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, which complicates the presidential election process, but is reduced by the Electoral College to announce a clear winner. The runoff election once happened to Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992.

Many argue the fact that the Electoral College method may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state. People knowing their vote will have no effect, will have less intentions of paying attention to the election then they would have if the president picked the popular vote. Voter's in presidential elections are people who want to express a political reference and want the best for their country's future rather than people who think one vote may decide the election and disregard the point of voting.",0,train_essays,,9
A094036DE672," In my opinion, setting a curfew time for teenagers during the week and weekends is a wise decision that helps parents keep track of their children's whereabouts and ensures their safety. If a teenager's weekday curfew is set at 10 pm, it is reasonable because it allows them to go home after school, change, and spend time with friends until the curfew time. However, if they come back home after 10 pm, they are disobeying the law and the consequences could be severe. For instance, they could be put on probation for two weeks, wear an ankle bracelet that alerts an officer if they try to sneak out, or be placed in juvenile detention for a week. If these consequences don't work, the teenager could be put under the supervision of an officer to take them to school, home, and work to prevent them from sneaking out again. On the weekends, the curfew time would be all day until 12 am, and the consequences for coming back home after that time would be even more severe, such as being put on house arrest, being on probation with an officer watching them, or being locked up in a juvenile detention center for four weeks.

NASA'S spacecraft called Viking 1 was circumnavigating the planet, snapping photos of possible landning sites for the other spacecraft viking 2.

When Viking 2 was found, it was a shadow likeness of a human face.

It was huge, its length was two miles from end to end. The caption noted it was huge rock formation, but it resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

That does not mean it was an alien, it just means that thats the way the natural landform formed.

The ""Face on Mars"" has been everywhere from Hollywood films to grocery store checkout lines for 25 years.

Very few scienists believe that he Face was an alien artifact, phtographing Cydonial became a priority for NASA and Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in Septemebr and the year of 1997, about eighteen long tirinig years after the Viking mission concluded.

It says in the story that the team which is called MOC snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Vikings photograph.

Thousands of peoples anxiety were coming out when they searched the web waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site revealing the answer.

The answer is a Natural landform, there was no alien monument after all.

On April 8, 2001 a war summer day in Cydonia.

Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.

""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,""

said Garvin.

Malin's crew captured and extraordinary image using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Each pixel in he 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.

But as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times better and bigger that pixel size.

So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they where.

The picture actually reveals that there is a martian equivalent of butte or mesa landforms common around the American West.",0,persuade_corpus,,8

Sometimes, when you want a red sweatshirt or a green sweatshirt, you would gather the information that your friends or peers gave you and whatever you got the most suggested you would go for that. For example, my friends said that I would look good in the green sweatshirt, so I got the green sweatshirt because that one came up the most.

We usually look for multiple answers because when you can't decide on something, you would go to your friends or peers to help you. Gathering the information that they all give you could help but not always. Say that you had a tie, you would go with whatever you like the most or you would go to some one for a tie breaker. For example, if I got the both the green sweatshirt and red sweatshirt results and they both came out to be the same, I would either go to someone to break the tie or I would break the tie myself.

llama_70b_v11125,"Dear Principal,

I believe that requiring students to perform community service is a great idea. Community service provides students with the opportunity to give back to their community, develop new skills, and build their character. It also helps students to understand the importance of civic responsibility and the role they can play in making their community a better place.

Many of my friends who have participated in community service have had positive experiences. For example, those who have tutored elementary school children have seen the impact they can have on a child's education and confidence. They have also developed their own communication and leadership skills. Similarly, those who have cleaned up litter have helped to keep our community clean and beautiful, and have also learned about the importance of environmental conservation.

In addition, requiring community service can help to foster a sense of community and social responsibility among students. By working together on service projects, students can form new friendships and develop a sense of belonging. They can also learn about different social issues and how they can make a positive impact.

Of course, some of my friends may argue that community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. However, I believe that the benefits of community service far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Not only does it provide students with valuable skills and experiences, but it also helps to build their compassion and empathy for others.

Moreover, community service can also be a great way to learn about different career paths and explore new interests. For example, a student who is interested in medicine can volunteer at a hospital, while a student who is interested in environmental science can participate in a conservation project.

In conclusion, I believe that requiring students to perform community service is a great way to instill a sense of civic responsibility, character, and compassion among students. It provides them with valuable skills and experiences, and helps to build a stronger community. I hope that you will consider implementing a community service requirement for all students.

They can kind of help drive when someone is tired and can prevent accidents.

They help take people's lives out of danger.

I think the development of these cars is a good thing for the world.

To start off, the fuel needed for these cars is half of the fuel amount we use right now on regular cars, stated in the first paragraph.

That is saying that the amount you are paying now for gas would be cut in half.

There are sensors in these smart cars that have been placed everywhere around the cars.

In places such as the mirror, the wheels and on the roof.

These sensors may not be new, but they have developed into something amazing that helps protect.

The driverless cars have many functions that can help protect people in many different ways and situations.

Some of those functions include, antilock brakes and driver assisting.

They have come a long way in developin this driverless car.

Theses cars can now steer themselves, accelerate, and brake by themsleves.

This is a huge step in car technology.

There are some things that the cars may need done to make it perfect, but it is still one step closer to making our lives a little easier.

These cars will have in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.

These displays will be turned off when instantly when the driver needs to take over.

The project would be great for students to learn and have fun because you can do things like have a lessons with the activities where the kids can pick between thing because not all kids like everything to be just told to them. kids feel better when they can have fun and everything isn't crammed in their brains for 7 hours a day. Which would make them tired and not ready to learn. This would be perfect for students who are hands on type of learners. They can be hands on because the project is student based. Not every kid learns the same so kids who learn differently would be more comfortable because its not a 7 hour classroom environment where they just sit in class all day.

Student would have more say or more of a voice because is about them.

By making the project student based students can present thier feelings and their feedback about what they like and don't like. It can also help teacher get a better undestanding about their students. They can also create bonds with new people such as students and teachers. Nobody want to be taught by a teacher they don't like. This will cause kids not being motivated to learn from the teacher and will probably cause bad behavior.

E81B50098AAC," In my opinion, attending school is crucial for students' academic success. While distance learning may seem like a convenient option for some, it can lead to irresponsibility and a lack of accountability. Online classes can be a distraction, with students easily getting sidetracked by social media, text messages, and other electronic devices.

Taking classes online can also lead to procrastination and a lack of motivation. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may put off completing assignments until the last minute, which can lead to poor grades and a lack of understanding of the material.

On the other hand, attending school in person provides students with the opportunity to ask questions and receive immediate feedback from their teachers. This can help students to better understand the material and develop critical thinking skills. Additionally, attending school in person can help students to develop responsibility and accountability, as they are required to attend classes and complete assignments on time.

In conclusion, while distance learning may seem like a convenient option, attending school in person is crucial for students' academic success.

8311ABD30CC1," There is a growing debate among parents, educators, and policymakers about whether or not schools should extend the school day by two hours. While some may argue that this would provide students with more opportunities to learn and grow, others believe that it would cause undue stress and negatively impact their grades. In this essay, I will argue that schools should not follow this model by extending the school day by two hours.

Firstly, extending the school day by two hours would place an additional burden on students' families. Many fathers may feel that their children are already spending too much time at school and that extending the day would only add to their stress and anxiety. Furthermore, some families may not have the financial means to provide transportation for their children to attend school for an additional two hours. This would place an unfair burden on these families and could lead to a decrease in attendance rates.

Secondly, extending the school day by two hours would take away from students' extracurricular activities. Many students have responsibilities outside of school, such as jobs, sports practices, and family obligations. Extending the school day by two hours would take away from their ability to participate in these activities and could lead to a decrease in their overall well-being. Furthermore, some students may struggle to balance their school work with their extracurricular activities, and extending the school day could only make this more difficult.

Finally, extending the school day by two hours would not necessarily lead to improved academic performance. While some studies have shown that additional time in school can lead to higher grades, others have found that it has little or no effect. Furthermore, students may feel overwhelmed and stressed by the added time in school, which could lead to a decrease in their academic performance.

In conclusion, while extending the school day by two hours may seem like a good idea, it would come with a number of negative consequences. It would place an unfair burden on students' families, take away from their extracurricular activities, and may not even lead to improved academic performance. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending the school day by two hours.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

75F898F291C7,"The students of today are the future of tomorrow. Students need a good education to be the next leaders of the world. People will look up to them one day and they will need to be educated correctly. Having the correct education and correct learning environment in can go a long way. Although some may disagree, active learning and friendships proves that online school will not benefit students.

Active learning is only possible by meeting in person and having the pleasure of talking to them face to face. For example, students tend to learn better when they are actively learning in a classroom with less distractions. I, myself, tend to get distracted fairly easily with my phone. Last week during my physics class I was on my phone and I missed an important date. The teacher did not repeat it because I was not paying attention. Teens attention span is not that long and when we get put into our own home it is an overall distraction. Another example of how active learning is better at school is for the teachers. Eariler in the month I was struggling in my math class and the teacher came up to me to see if I needed extra help because she noticed I was struggling. If I was to be in online school then the teachers would not notice I was struggling because they cannot see me. Active learning is the best form of learning.

While on the topic of communication between teacher and students, friendships are a lot easier to make while attending school. For example, I have met a lot of new people at school that do not live close to me. I would have never met one of my best friends if it wasn't for school. School brought us together by letting us see each other everyday. Online school could dis encourage friendships because students are not meeting new people. Another reason why friendships are a lot easier to make attending school is because of sports. High school and middle school sports are a way for teens to engage in school activities. I have met a lot of new people through high school baseball and basketball because they share the same interest as me. Meeting people that enjoy the same things as me is just a conversations starter, which leads to friendships. Friendships and the feeling over being included is just as important as school.

Some may believe that online school is better because the people who have a hard time in school by getting bullied won't have that fear anymore. While thinking that way is reasonable, it is inaccurate because teens will always go through hardships and they will need to overcome that hardships. For example, Oprah Winfrey had a hard and gruesome childhood. She did not give up and has overcome all of her obstacles in life to get where she is today. Oprah is now one of the most influential women in the world and overcame all of her obstacles. Overcoming hardships at school can make individuals stronger as a person.

This is important because students need a good education for a good future. People in the past went to school everyday with no technology and had to learn in person. Since that way has been working, there is no need for a change. Students of the future can hopefully see how much more beneficial going to school is than attending online school.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
7E48A7A7B400," When I was in elementary school, I always dreamed of having art lessons. Art is the lesson that I would like to share with elementary school students because it has the potential to positively impact their lives in various ways.

Firstly, art can help students develop patience. When working on an art project, it is essential to wait for the paint or other materials to dry before adding more details. This waiting time can be challenging for some students, but it can also teach them the value of patience. Additionally, when students make mistakes during the process, they may need to redo the work, which requires patience. Furthermore, when working in groups, students may need to communicate their ideas and collaborate with others, which can also help them develop patience.

Secondly, art can foster creativity. When creating art, students are required to think outside the box and come up with unique ideas. This creativity can not only help them in school but also in their future careers. For example, if a student dreams of becoming an artist, they will need to be creative to produce original works. Moreover, being creative can help students problem-solve and approach challenges in a new way.

Lastly, art can help students focus on their work. When working on an art project, students need to concentrate on the task at hand to produce high-quality work. If they lose focus, they may make mistakes that require them to start over. Furthermore, being focused can help students in their academic and personal lives. For instance, when studying for exams, it is essential to concentrate on the material to understand it better.

In conclusion, art can have a significant impact on students' lives. It can help them develop patience, foster creativity, and improve focus. As such, I believe that art lessons should be an essential part of the elementary school curriculum. By providing students with the opportunity to learn and express themselves through art, we can help them become well-rounded individuals who are prepared for success in all aspects of life.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

Another thing is that kids who are sick or have anxiety can still go to skool without having to worry about being in a room full of other kids. That's why I think it would be good for kids who have trouble with social anxiety. They could still lern and participate without feeling nervous. My friend's sister does distance lerning and she says she feels way more comfortable.

It would also be good for kids who have to miss skool for some reason. Like if they have a doctors apt or something. They could still go to skool and not fall behind. My cousin had to miss skool for a week because of a family emergency, but he was able to keep up with his work because of distance lerning.

I know some people might say that distance lerning would be bad because kids need to be in a classroom to learn. But, if they have a good internet connection, they can still see and hear everything the teacher is saying. They can even ask questions and participate in discussions. It's like they're in the classroom but they're at home.

291D2BC7F86A,"Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter regarding the possible new policy change of students grades and their ability to participate in extra-curricular activities. I think your proposition to require students to have a B average to participate in sports is unreasonable. I believe this because if you take a look at the grading scale, a student with a C average is considered as an average student. As you probably know, at our school there is a large amount of students who have and maintain a C average. Your new policy restricts average students from participating in after school activities. I believe this is unfair because many kids take project-based classes that sometimes only have four to five grades entering the grade book a semester. If one kid flukes up and gets a D or an F on his or her first project, they will have to wait quite a long time to bring their average back up in order to participate in extra-curricular activities.

I am all for putting restrictions on students who are failing classes, but kids who have a C average and work hard to maintain that average should not be punished for their grades.

Also, if you raise the standards for qualification to play in after school sports and activities, some of your students may suffer greatly from the effects of the change. I, as a student, know that if fellow students are being pressured to raise a grade higher than what they have, they can end up being bogged down by the pressure and stress. Some students may think that they have no chance in getting a B average, so they give up and just get even worse grades.

We all know that academics come first, and that in order to participate in school sports, students have to work hard in school. Our school's students would suffer and be sad that the C averages they work so hard to achieve will not be good enough to participate in after school sports.

Overall, I think that your possible new policy to require students to maintain a B average is unreasonable because an average grade on the grading scale is a C. This policy would only allow above average students to participate in sports, and while it may propel some students to work harder, it will negatively effect many of our students.

Unfortunately, the use of cellphones for everyday life a lot of the times, takes place in cars. As a result, many accidents have taken place due to the use of cellular phones while on the road. Many people are not aware of just how serious this has become, which is why people should not be allowed to use phones in cars without a hands free device.

The use of phones while driving not only puts the person driving in danger, but all the people around them. It takes one person to make one decision that can affect the lives of many.

People do not take into consideration the horrible facts about accidents caused by cell phones when choosing to use their phones. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. It also states that nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving and 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk, but people still to this day do not think about the possible consequences of phones and driving.

Phones are not always a bad thing in cars, when following the right protocols. They help with navigation, communication, and are vital in the event of an emergency. Many states have banned the use of using a cell phone in any manner without a hands free device, which has decreased the amount of phone caused accidents. This law, although a struggle for some to follow, ultimately has everyone's best interest. People everywhere should be educated about the dangers of cell phone use in cars and about safer alternatives, and should be punished for not using a safer solution.

As seen, driving while talking on the phone is very dangerous. Also, with new laws if you're caught, you can be fined and could ultimately get your driver's license suspended. People can avoid all this trouble by only talking on your mobile phone when you are parked and out of the way of traffic. It could save your life one day. The use of a hands-free kit with your mobile phone as you drive doesn't eliminate risk, as you still might be distracted, but it does help cut it down. Driving a car is dangerous enough without adding still more risk by texting or talking and it is important that people are aware of that    ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

ED57CFEC1CF1,"Hey there! 

So, the influence of parents and teachers on young people, huh?  Let me tell you, they have a HUGE impact on our lives! Like, seriously huge. My parents and teachers have shaped me into the person I am today, and I'm super grateful for that.

First off, my parents. They've always been there for me, supporting me no matter what. They've taught me the importance of hard work and perseverance, and they've encouraged me to pursue my passions. For example, I've always loved playing soccer, and they've been to every single game I've played in. They've cheered me on, even when I messed up big time.  They've shown me that it's okay to make mistakes, as long as I learn from them.

And my teachers?  They're like superheroes, but instead of fighting villains, they fight for our education. They've challenged me to think critically and creatively, and they've pushed me to reach my full potential. Like, I remember last year, we were learning about fractions in math class, and it was like, super hard. But my teacher, Mrs. Johnson, took the time to explain it to me until I got it. And now, I'm actually good at fractions! 

But why is it important to have goals, you ask?  Well, having goals gives us direction in life. It helps us focus on what we want to achieve, and it gives us something to work towards. And even if it seems challenging at first, having goals is like, super important for our personal growth.  Think about it, if we didn't have any goals, we'd just be floating around aimlessly, like a leaf in the wind.

The advantages of limiting car usage is helping the environment. ""passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" While most of the adult population is driving cars everyday, more gas and smoke go into the air and into our environment. This causes pollution and hurts our environment. Paris has a major smog problem in their environment, up to the point where it was nearrecorded. Paris had to then enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. The effect of this ban was that congestion was down 60 percent and the smog cleared after a short week. If we were able to limit our car usage, then our greenhouse gas emissions would decrease. ""In the United States, the environmental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities, and legislators are starting to act."" There are numerous environmental agencies that are already starting to act to decrease the car usage in the country. We should limit our car usage because it can greatly help our environment.

If were able to limit our car usage, then it will greatly decrease our stress of driving. Many countries are trying to reduce car usage. An example is Columbia. Columbia has created a carfree day. ""Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses during carfree day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Bogota, Colombia have practiced this day for three years and many colombians have been pleased with it. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Plaza. Without driving, you have the time to go out, be active and get exercise. A huge effect of the car free day is that park and sport centers have been built all throughout Bogota, smoother sidewalks, and rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. With car usage reduced, it limit people's stress on driving.

If we were able to lower the number of car usage, then our streets would be much safer and there would be less traffic. Many people use cars today and because of that most of streets are usually blocked up. If there were less cars on the streets then it would be easier and quicker to go to places. Vanban, Germany is an example of an carfree town. ""...basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls alond some distant highway."" With less cars on the streets, it can also reduce car accidents and deaths. If there were less cars on the roads, there would be less traffic and car accidents.

With the capability of providing non-stop access to the Internet, smartphones can be used to access emails, videos, games, and even social media platforms, which can result in students becoming easily diverted from learning. In addition, having a smartphone in the classroom can be a major source of peer social comparison and rivalry, leading to a disruption of the learning environment. 

Parents should be aware of the risks associated with the use of smartphones in the classroom. It is important to have open dialogue with parents about the role of smartphones in the classroom and the potential dangers of being too addicted or immersed in technology. Educators should emphasize that smartphones can be a positive tool when used responsibly, such as for researching specific topics and connecting with other students, but that their use can become a distraction if not monitored properly. 

In order to properly address how to handle smartphones in the classroom, schools should consider the impacts it can have on families. Having policies in place which focus on using smartphones to promote learning rather than distract from it is important. When a student is using a phone, there should be clear rules for being respectful of classmates, not engaging with inappropriate content, and not overusing the phone during class time. It should also be made clear that teachers and school administration will be monitoring smartphone use in the classroom, and that the students should understand the consequences of not abiding by the rules.

9D6E844DBDF2," Taking art classes can be a fulfilling experience for many individuals. For some, it is a passion that they have always wanted to pursue, while others may have stumbled upon it by accident. Regardless of the reason, art classes can have a profound impact on one's life, both personally and professionally.

For example, consider the case of a young woman named Sarah. She has always had a love for art and has been drawing and painting since she was a child. However, as she grew older, she found herself struggling to find the time and resources to continue pursuing her passion. That is until she stumbled upon an art class at her local community center.

At first, Sarah was hesitant to join the class. She had never received formal training in art and was worried that she would not be able to keep up with the other students. But with some encouragement from the instructor and the support of her fellow classmates, she quickly found that she was able to learn and grow as an artist.

Over time, Sarah's confidence in her abilities grew, and she began to see the potential for her art to make a difference in the world. She started selling her paintings at local art fairs and markets, and soon found that she was able to make a living doing what she loved.

For others, like Sarah, art class may be a way to turn a passion into a career. But for others, it may be a way to learn new skills and broaden their horizons. Art classes can teach students a variety of techniques and mediums, from painting and drawing to sculpture and photography. These skills can be applied to a wide range of fields, from graphic design and advertising to fashion and interior design.

In addition to the practical benefits, art classes can also have a therapeutic effect on individuals. Art has long been recognized as a way to reduce stress and anxiety, and many people find that creating art can be a relaxing and fulfilling way to unwind.

Overall, art classes can be a valuable tool for personal and professional growth.

I believe that students have the potential to make a significant impact on the community if they choose to do so. Parents and teachers can also play a crucial role in helping the community. By working together, we can make a real difference in our town and the world.

Community service is a great way for students to give back to their community. They can help pick up litter, assist people in need, and even save endangered animals. Additionally, community service can help clean up the planet and promote sustainability. Students can start by making small changes in their daily lives, such as reducing their carbon footprint or volunteering at local organizations.

Teachers can also play a vital role in community service. They can organize service projects for their students and provide guidance and support. By incorporating community service into the curriculum, teachers can help students develop important skills such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving.

Parents can also get involved in community service by volunteering their time and resources. They can help organize fundraisers, participate in clean-up efforts, and even mentor younger students. By working together, parents and teachers can create a strong sense of community and instill a sense of responsibility and civic engagement in the next generation.

In conclusion, community service is an important way for students, parents, and teachers to make a positive impact on the world. By working together, we can create a better future for ourselves and future generations. I encourage everyone to get involved and make a difference.

I understand that some people in this world do not care about our community at all, but it is very important to at least try to change it. Requiring students to do community service will make keep our community a clean and safe environment. Therefore, I believe that community service should be required for students at school not everyday, but at least maybe twice a week.

By doing this, you and everyone else who participates in this should be rewarded, but at the same time take responsibility to keep on making this place better for everybody. Some students may help with tutoring other students who needs help with schoolwork or something along the lines of that. Other people go around picking trash up of the ground and putting it where it belongs and trying their best to keep our environment clean.

Today, we still have people going around throwing trash on the grounds. I myself, have experienced people putting trash on the grounds and leaving it there. It hurts me because everyday I look at how much work people put into making schools, office buildings, restaurants, and etc. I hope that you have learned a lot from this and go along with requiring students to do community service no matter what it is they are doing.

falcon_180b_v1_860,"I believe that dress codes are beneficial for the school environment. One reason is that they help students focus on their studies rather than their clothing. When students wear the same type of clothes, they are less likely to be distracted by what others are wearing. For example, if everyone wears the same color shirt, students won't be talking about who has the coolest shirt or who's wearing something weird.

Another reason why dress codes are good is that they can help prevent bullying. If students wear the same type of clothes, then they won't be judged based on their clothing. Sometimes, students who wear different clothes are teased, and this can cause them to feel sad or left out. If everyone wears the same thing, then no one will be left out or bullied because of their clothes.

Dress codes also help students learn how to dress appropriately for different situations. For example, if a student is going to a job interview, they will need to dress in a formal way. If they have been wearing a dress code at school, they will know how to dress appropriately for the interview.

Finally, dress codes help students feel like they are part of a team. If everyone wears the same clothes, then they will feel like they are part of the same group. This can help improve school spirit and make students feel more connected to their school.

In conclusion, dress codes can be beneficial for the school environment. They help students focus on their studies, prevent bullying, teach appropriate dress for different situations, and help students feel like they are part of a team.

ED9C6EDC5601,"Adding another hour and thirty minutes to the school schedule is just a waste of time! It means having to miss time with my family. It also means having to wake up earlier to get to school. Teachers would have to stay back and work longer but probably get paid the same amount for ten hours. So I disagree with having to add another hour and thirty minutes.

First of all I don't think kids would like to wake up extra early and get ready for school. Once the students get to the school they would be half asleep and it would be harder for them to focus. The students would have trouble staying awake and they would have more attitude then what they have now. More students would be marked tardy and there would more students skipping classes just to get some sleep. Not every student would stay awake through out the day and finish there work.

Adding an hour and thirty minutes would also have an impact on teachers. They already have to wake up extra early in order to be here on time and stay late to work on grading papers, going to meetings, etc. It would be harder for them to stay awake and teach. Teachers don't even get paid enough. So why would they want to stay back and serve more time.

Some after school activities would get canceled and student that would need those after school activities would get mad. Complaints would start coming in and parents would get mad and ask why their child is failing. Some sports would be canceled and and athletes would get frustrated because they won't be motivated or asked to go to a certain collage. Students would get low grades if after school activities were to get canceled. The school would become a laughing stock.

7E08C001A673,"When we ask for advice we usually ask multiple people instead of just one, but why do we ask multiple people? When people ask for advice, they usually talk to more than one person, I believe this is a great idea because you can see the majority of what people would do, learn from others past experiences, and you can see multiple views to decide which is best for you. We all have choices in life to make and sometimes we dont know what to do in that situation. Advice is what people tell us to give us a idea and better understanding of what we should do. Thats why we ask for advice in the first place so that we can have help to make our decision.

A amazing reason for asking many different people for advice is you can see the majority of what people would do. One very common way people decide on things is to take a majority vote. This simply means you find the most favored option among many people. These can be things as small as a class vote on movie day to things as big as elections. So if there is a big difference in the votes for each choice. Then you should chose the option that the majority of people would chose if you were basing your decision off of a majority vote.

Another great reason for asking many different people for advice is you can learn from others past experiences. Everyone makes mistakes in life. We can learn from others mistake so we don't make the same mistake. By asking about peoples past experiences we can fin out their mistakes with their choices. Also by finding out about people's past experiences we can learn from their successes. If people have had success going with a certain option or choice then that would be a good choice for us to make.

One last reason for asking many different people for advice is you can be exposed to a wide variety of views to decide the best option for you. Everyone is entitled to and has heir own opinion. Almost never is someones view on a topic or choice the exact same. The more people you ask for advice, the more possible choices you will be exposed to. This can better your understand of the topic and can help you make your choice in the end.

There are more texting and driving accidents then drunk driving accidents. People mostly focus on their phone then focusing and staying behind the wheel not crashed into a tree.

7EA986233EDA,"The pursuit of success is a journey that is often fraught with setbacks and failures. However, the most successful individuals have a unique ability to overcome these obstacles and stay enthusiastic about their goals. In this essay, we will explore the factors that enable successful people to achieve their dreams and draw a comparison to the points discussed in the prompt.

Firstly, successful people are often driven by a deep passion for their chosen field. Whether it's a love for music, a desire to make a difference in the world, or a drive to innovate, this passion fuels their determination to succeed. For example, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has a deep passion for space exploration and renewable energy. This passion has driven him to overcome numerous failures and setbacks in his pursuit of success.

Secondly, successful people often have a growth mindset. They believe that failure is a natural part of the learning process and that it can be used as an opportunity to grow and improve. For example, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, faced numerous rejections from publishers before finally finding success. Instead of giving up, she used these setbacks as motivation to refine her craft and eventually achieve her dream.

Thirdly, successful people often have a strong work ethic and are willing to put in the hard work necessary to achieve their goals. They understand that success requires dedication and perseverance, and they are willing to put in the time and effort to make their dreams a reality. For example, Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of all time, famously missed over 9,000 shots in his career. However, he never gave up and continued to work hard to improve his skills and achieve success on the court.

In conclusion, the pursuit of success requires a combination of passion, a growth mindset, and a strong work ethic. By staying enthusiastic about their goals and never giving up, even in the face of failure, successful people are able to overcome obstacles and achieve their dreams. As we can see from the examples of Elon Musk, J.K. Rowling, and Michael Jordan, these factors are crucial in achieving success and should be emulated by anyone looking to achieve their own dreams.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0

Students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school, to be used during lunch periods and or free time. Cell phone usage has increased in the last five to ten years and is an important gadget for everyday life. People have social lives in school and cell phones are a very important way to communicate socially as well as in emergencies. Cell phones may be a distraction and can disrupt the learning environment of the class that is why it should be used during lunch hours. you may agree or disagree with my view on usage of cell phones in school , but most of the students at school agree with me. Also cell phone usage is not harmful towards the education of a student if used during parts of school time where no one is teaching.

Many people including you may think that there are so many negative point in cell phone usage during lunch but actually it really is not. If you think about it lunch is used to socialize and so is free time. So during the period of lunch, kids who are sick or on vacation can communicate with friends at school at that time, also if you are planning to go somewhere and you want tell your family beforehand you can give them a call or send a text, or if you just want to talk to someone in a different school you can if cell phone usage is allowed. there might be negatives to, but that can be easily turned positive.

Cell phones also can be disruptive during class, and we all know that if cell phones are allowed to be used there must be some rules and regulations and I have come up with some. First cell phones should not be used during class time. All phones should be placed on silent and any cell phone should not interfere with the learning environment during any class. If any of these rules are violated you may come up with your own consequences and enforce them. So please take this letter into consideration and hopefully you will listen to the voice of many kids and allow cell phone usage during lunch hours or free time.

Okay, so, asking for advice when making big decisions can be really helpful for like, a bunch of reasons. First of all, it's cost-effective!  Like, instead of making a huge mistake and then having to deal with the consequences, you can just ask someone who's been through it before and learn from their experiences.  It's like, why reinvent the wheel when you can just ask someone who already knows how to make a wheel? Get it? 

And secondly, having someone else's outside perspective can be really helpful.  Like, sometimes we get so caught up in our own thoughts and feelings that we can't see the obvious solution. But if you ask someone else, they might be able to see it more clearly and give you a fresh perspective.  It's like, having a second pair of eyes to look at the problem.

And lastly, asking for advice can actually raise your chances of success!  Like, if you're trying to start a business or something, asking someone who's already done it can give you valuable insights into what works and what doesn't.  It's like, having a mentor or something.

But,  there are also some drawbacks to not asking for advice when you need it.  Like, if you don't ask for help when you're struggling, you might end up making things worse.  It's like, if you don't know how to fix a car engine, you shouldn't try to fix it yourself if you don't know what you're doing.  You might end up breaking it even more!

""Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"".

9385B4D84BFC,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. There are more facts to prove that aliens have nothing to do with the Face on Mars. There are less facts to prove that aliens did it. Use commen sense. Don't assume somethig without having facts to back it up.

The first fact that tells us that it was not aliens is, scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" This tells us that aliens didn't make it, and that it just formed from shadows that made it look like a face on mars when it was just an illusion.

In the text it states, thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

Furthermore, the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. ""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Those were some facts that tell us that aliens didn't have nothing to do with the Face on Mars. It was just an illusion. It made people wonder if there was life on Mars or if there use to be an ancient civilzation on Mars. But, in the end it was just a rock formation. There are more facts to back up that aliens didn't do it. There are less facts to prove that aliens did do it. People saw the picture of the Face on Mars and assumed it had to do with aliens since it looked so much like a face. But, its best to not assume something before you have strong facts to back it up. The Face on Mars isn't forgotten though. It's still something amazing that happend on Mars. It was the first time that something so amazing was caught on camara on Mars. It might never be seen again. We can always remember it as the Face on Mars. ",0,persuade_corpus,,8

B2055DB7B29E,"Self-esteem is an individual’s opinion of themselves and their worth. It can be influenced by many different sources such as past experiences, family and society. Achievement is also a source of self-esteem. That is, achieving something – whether it be a personal goal or a major victory – can lead to a higher level of self-confidence. 

For example, a student who works diligently for a school project and earns a perfect score can gain a boost in their self-esteem. That student may then set larger goals for themselves in the future and feel more capable of meeting challenges. Alternatively, a worker who receives a promotion can feel proud of their success. This positive recognition of their achievement can boost their level of self-worth and lead to higher credibility when trying to achieve future goals. 

The process of achieving something can also be a source of self-esteem. Setting goals and objectives and pushing one’s self to achieve them can be a very rewarding experience in terms of self-confidence and self-worth. Achieving something also can involve rewarding yourself for successes. This could be in the form of celebratory treats or taking time for yourself to relax and enjoy the fruits of your hard work. Equally important is being able to recognize your successes, both big and small.

In conclusion, achievement is a great source of self-esteem for many people. Not only does achieving something lead to a higher level of self-confidence and recognition, but the process of committing to and achieving a goal is also a self-esteem booster. Knowing how to reward yourself after achieving something and setting goals appropriately so that they are achievable are also important strategies.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

64AE19BBA321,"Stressful situations and difficult problems are a part of life that everyone faces at some point. Whether it's a difficult class, a challenging relationship, or a personal struggle, it's important to have the right tools and strategies to face and solve these problems. In this essay, I will provide tips and advice on how to deal with stressful situations and difficult problems, and I will also discuss an example of a life problem and how it can be solved.

One effective way to deal with stressful situations and difficult problems is to break them down into smaller, more manageable parts. By focusing on one aspect of the problem at a time, you can avoid feeling overwhelmed and make progress towards a solution. Additionally, it can be helpful to prioritize the problem based on its level of importance and urgency. This can help you determine which problems require immediate attention and which can wait.

Another strategy for dealing with stressful situations and difficult problems is to seek support from others. Talking to friends, family, or a counselor can provide a fresh perspective on the problem and can help you develop a plan of action. It can also be helpful to practice self-care, such as getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in physical activity.

An example of a life problem that many people face is being bullied. Being bullied can have a profound impact on a person's mental and emotional well-being, and it's important to address the problem as soon as possible. One way to solve this problem is to seek support from a trusted adult, such as a teacher, counselor, or parent. It can also be helpful to practice assertiveness and stand up for yourself in a calm and respectful manner.

The benefits of facing and solving a problem, such as being bullied, are numerous. For one, it can help you develop resilience and improve your self-esteem. It can also help you learn valuable skills, such as communication and problem-solving, that can be applied to other areas of your life. Additionally, facing and solving a problem can provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.

It is important to tell a friend or family member about a problem because it can provide emotional support and help you feel less alone. Talking to someone about a problem can also provide a fresh perspective and can help you develop a plan of action. Additionally, it can be helpful",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,1
E2FC55BF5005,"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For my essay, I'm gonna talk about the new menu in our cafeteria and whether it's a good idea or not. 🍔🥤

So, the pros of introducing a new menu are pretty cool. First, it'll give us more options to choose from, which means we can try new foods and maybe even find something we really like! 🤤 Some people might not like the food we already have, so this could be a good change for them. Plus, it'll make the cafeteria more interesting and fun. 🎉

But, there are also some cons to think about. What if the new menu doesn't have anything that we like? 🤷‍♀️ Or, what if it's too expensive and our parents don't want to pay for it? 💸 That could be a problem, especially if we're talking about a big menu change. And, what about students who have dietary restrictions? 🥗 They might not be able to eat some of the new foods, so we need to make sure the menu is still inclusive.

Another thing to consider is how long we've been going to this school. If we've been here for a while, we might get used to the old menu and not want to change it. 😔 But, on the other hand, if we've been here for a while, we might be more open to trying new things. 🤔

So, overall, I think introducing a new menu could be a good idea, but we need to think about all the pros and cons and make sure it's gonna work out for everyone. 🤝 What do you think? 🤔

CFFD84E8F43B,"The benefits of participating in drama, music, art, or any other class can be far-reaching. Such classes provide students with invaluable experiences that not only enrich their academic pursuits, but also open the doors to a range of potential career opportunities. Participating in such classes can provide students with an enhanced understanding of the world around them, as well as the tools to better explore and appreciate it.

The knowledge and skills gained from these classes can provide students with an LEDE (Leadership, Ethics, Development, and Engagement) that can help them work toward and achieve their individual and collective goals. Such classes also offer students a chance to explore their creative sides and develop talents that may otherwise be left untapped. These skills and understanding can help students in a variety of ways, including better understanding their role in society and helping improve their job prospects.

Second reason, i think it fair if we use our phones cause i bet all school in this world teacher use their phone that is a other reason. it unfair that the grow ups can but not us they need to do theirs job then if we need to do ours job and i hope you think about that to see us feel about it.

Third reason, kids get stuff done and they don't have nothing else to do instead let us use in that time and we will be little happy.

99523E300943,"To be a teacher-designed or student-designed project, is the question many have sought to answer. A teacher-designed project, has the guidance students need to create a great project. A student-designed project, has the freedom that many students desire for. Students want to pick any topic that interests them. Nonetheless, both of these choices, are a great way to keep students engaged over the summer. Although some say student-designed projects are the way to go, however, teacher-designed project are much more relevant and helpful for the students.

The benefit of a student-designed project is that the students have the freedom of choosing whatever topic that interests them. They get to focus on the things that they want to bring to light. This makes student-designed projects much more enjoyable for the students. Humans being humans, they love the ability to pick and choose. This is no exception for students. Not to mention that they could have more creativity when it comes to creating a project. Suppose if a student wanted to demonstrate the affect of stomach acid on vegetables, it would be much more interesting for the student to demonstrate via pictures and experiments as opposed to writing a paper about it.

A teacher-designed project however, could be much more helpful for students. The guidance that teacher-designed project offer, is undeniable in the fact that it helps students create the best piece of work they possibly can. More often then not, teacher-designed projects offer an outline or a list of things students need to include in their projects. This by itself, guarantees students a top grade. Students can use that outline to guide them and go off by the outline. Students can also make sure that they include everything in their projects that the teacher had asked for.

Relevancy is another benefit that teacher-designed projects offer. Teachers can give students a list of current or important issues to write a paper about. This will solidify the fact that everyone will want to read that paper. If a student picked the topic of for example, the amount of rainfall Virginia gets each year, it is less likely to appeal to a large number of audience. As opposed to the topic of the Corona virus, everyone is crazy to read about the Corona virus right now. If a student were to pick Corona virus as a topic to write about, everyone will want to read that paper. Similarly, a teacher can give students a list of topics that are currently important or relevant to write about so that it attracts much more attention.

The argument between teacher-designed projects, versus student designed projects have sparked much debate. But given the advantages and disadvantages of each of them, it is clear that one of them is more beneficial to students than the other. Many believe that student-designed projects offer more freedom for students, but, teacher-designed projects are far more beneficial due to the fact that it provides guidance and relevancy. Nothing can beat the guidance of a teachers given to their students.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
750AFA674F45,"I think students would not benefit taking online classes or videos conferencing from home. Students not learn to much because they do not receive a good explication about the class as a real teacher would to explains in the school, not have rulers and online classes not catches the students attention.

Students not learn to much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class and they give up when nobody help them.

Would you able to do the right thing when there are not rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they don't have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This steal the students concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allows students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home.

Online classes or videos conferencing not catchs the students attention like a teacher makes it. For example, if you are taking online classes from home and you are at the midpart of one the lesson but you get hungry then, you left the lesson to get eat. After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school? A teacher does not allows that a student left the school or to go to the park at the midpart of the class, while he is teaching because he wants to catch your attention to make you to learn more and morer. However, online classes or videos conferencing you can stop it and go or do whatever you want, then you lose knowledge abou it.

Some say that taking online classes or videos conferencing from home is a benefit for students. They are wrong because the students not learn to much and they would have bad grades. Other say that online classes or videos conferencing explain in good details.. They are wrong because real teachers explain better than online class or videos conferencing.

As you can see, taking online classes or videos conferencing from home, not helps the students to learn because if they are confusing they will get bad grades , nobody answer their question or doubts and they don't have rulers or limited to use any electronics devices.

Likewise in space exploration, we must be curious about the planet Venus. Venus is a planet that is very similar to Earth in many forms. The reason for studying space exploration is explained in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". Although the Venus' conditions are very absurd, but the doors that it can open are well worth the hardwork needed to explore the planet. That is why the author explains that Venus is a planet that is worth exploring due to exploring Venus is able to open more pathways to other types of space exploration and the planet has very close relations with Earth.

The author explains that it is true that in order to take step into the future, we must start space exploration. And the only way to do this is to start with a planet close to us. The author tells us that sometimes ""we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus"". If we are so close to Venus what is stopping us from exploring it?

There are an abundance of things that stop us form exploring Venus. But the author must first talk about the similarities and differences between Earth and Venus. Earth and Venus are suprisingly very similar in many ways. Due to this fact, Venus can help show us what may happen to Earth in the future. Earth and Venus have very similar ""density and size"". But they are different in that the atmosphere is ""thick"" with ""97 percent carbon dioxide"" and the temperatures of the planet ""average 800 degrees farenheit"". The planet also contains ""highly corrosive sulfuric acid"" and an atmospheric pressure ""90 times greater"" that Earth. This is highly alarming that a planet so close to Earth can also be so different. This sparks a curiosity in the brains of many space passionate people.

In culmination, the start of advanced space exploration starts with Venus. It is impossible to be unable to travel to Venus and expect to travel to other places in space. The author wants people to understand that exploring Venus is not pointless, but instead it can answer the many questions we have about our planet. Exploring venus is a challenge that people need to overcome. That is why the exploration of Venus starts a great leap in space exploration.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

A2957D006D28," The idea that first impressions are difficult to change is a widely held belief, but I disagree. While a person's appearance, personality, and communication skills can all influence your initial perception of them, it is important to remember that these factors are not always accurate. In fact, a person's true character can often be revealed through their actions and behavior over time.

For example, a person may appear friendly and approachable at first glance, but their true intentions may become clear as you get to know them better. Similarly, a person may appear confident and assertive, but their communication skills may be lacking, making it difficult to form a strong connection. On the other hand, a person may appear shy and reserved, but their true personality may shine through as they become more comfortable in your presence.

It is also important to remember that first impressions can be influenced by external factors, such as the environment and the situation. For example, a person may appear more confident and assertive in a professional setting than they would in a casual setting. Similarly, a person may appear more approachable and friendly in a group setting than they would one-on-one.

In addition, communication skills are not always a reflection of a person's true character. A person may appear confident and assertive, but their communication skills may be lacking, making it difficult to form a strong connection. On the other hand, a person may appear shy and reserved, but their communication skills may be excellent, making it easy to form a strong connection.

In conclusion, while first impressions can be influenced by a person's appearance, personality, and communication skills, it is important to remember that these factors are not always accurate.

AB9527C4A312," Technology has become an integral part of our lives, and it has had both positive and negative effects on people's lives. While humans use technology for various purposes, it has limited human contact, making it difficult for people to interact face-to-face. If technology did not exist, we would not have had the opportunity to learn more things, and we would not have been able to communicate with people from other continents or countries. Technology has made many things easier, and I believe that it can have a positive impact on our lives.

One of the positive effects of technology is that it has made communication easier. With the advent of technology, people can communicate with others from anywhere in the world, making it easier to stay in touch with friends and family. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to access information, making it easier to learn and grow. For example, students can use technology to access information on the internet, making it easier for them to complete their assignments.

Another positive effect of technology is that it has made many tasks easier. For example, technology has made it easier for doctors to perform surgeries and other medical procedures, saving more lives than in the past. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to work, allowing them to complete tasks more efficiently and accurately.

However, technology has also had negative effects on people's lives. For example, technology has made it easier for people to be distracted, making it harder for them to focus on important tasks. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to engage in harmful behaviors, such as cyberbullying and online harassment.

In conclusion, technology has both positive and negative effects on people's lives.

Hey there! Do you think driverless cars are a good or bad idea? I know I do! Let me tell you why.

Position:

I think driverless cars are a great idea! They would make our roads so much safer. Can you imagine not having to worry about drunk drivers or people texting and driving? It's like having a super responsible driver always at the wheel!

Body:

The article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" talks about how driverless cars can reduce the number of accidents on the road. It says that 90% of car crashes are caused by human error, so if we take humans out of the equation, we'll have a lot fewer accidents! That's a huge deal, especially since car crashes are one of the leading causes of death for people under 50. Plus, think about how much more productive we could be if we didn't have to worry about driving. We could read, watch movies, or even take a nap while on the road!

But, some people might say that driverless cars are a bad idea because they could be hacked or have technical issues. I get that, but the article also says that driverless cars are designed to have multiple backup systems, so even if one system fails, another can take over. And, hackers can already get into our computers and phones, so why not have them try to hack a car that's designed to be super secure?

Conclusion:

479A2864FFFC,"I am very on board with the idea that student projects enhance learning throughout the summer , but should the student projects be chosen but the students or by teachers ?

After extensive thought I believe they should be chosen by the students , but should have a firm rubrick and expectations on how to get full credit for completion of the project.

The thought behind student projects is to help the children continue learning even throughout the summer, so you want to make the project something cool that will make all kids even with different intrest, intrested enough that they will want to complete the project. I feel like if the teachers pick what the project should be about there will still be students who are not intrested enough to even bother completing it and they will see a sharp decline in the amount of students willing to complete a student project.

Now that being said i feel that there is a fine line between school appropriate projects and projects that are not. Students should not only be provided with a sheet that gives prompt ideas and lists what does meet project guidelines as well as a list of things that will result in a loss of points on the project. There are many things a student can come up with such as a photography journal with a paragraph beside each photograph explaining the significance of the Photo , or someone who loves astronomy completing a model solar system with why each planet is suitable or not suitable for life. Give them the option the express themselves through these projects not just throw something together because they want a grade.

I can also see the other side where people say that it should be teacher chosen so that they can provide detailed expectations of how the project should be completed , but you have to see that in a class of twenty or thirty students not all students are intrested in the same things. It will make the student who is not intrested feel left out when they see other people so excited to complete a project that they are gonna wait until the last night of summer and throw something together because it is not something they like. Consider all of the different personality types ? You cant have a one size fits all project because there will always be someone who it does not actually fit .

Thank you so much for allowing me to express my opinion in this paper. I am very aware that not everyone will have the same one as me but i do hope my argument made sense .",0,persuade_corpus,,8
BD128A3C6F33,"Do you have a problem that you are struggling to solve? Why don't you ask your friends for advice? When people ask for advice on solving a problem, often times they speak to more than one person. This is because different views are better for figuring out a tough problem, many opinions are better than one, and other people may have experienced a problem like yours and may be able to help you in making better decisions.

Different views are better for figuring out a tough problem, if only for the fact that they are different from yours. Asking more than one person their opinion helps greatly, because you receive a wide range of views different from your opinion. No one is exactly the same, and that goes for their opinions too. You may not like the answers you receive, but they can help you with your problem.

Many opinions are better than one, because every opinion is different. Seeking out more than one person for their opinions helps you more than just going to one person. Each person you ask is going to have a different take on your problem, and help you in solving it. Others' opinions may be weak, but those opinions can give you ideas, and from those ideas sprout possible answers. These possible answers, and the people that gave you those possible answers, are going to be the main factors in whether or not you solve your problem, so keep them close, because you're going to need them.

Other people may have experienced a problem like your and may be able to help you in making better decisions, so don't turn them down. Their experience with a problem like yours may become you greatest asset in solving your problem. Anyone can offer an opinion, but few people have actually had to solve that problem. Listen to everyone, but pay special attention to the ones who have solved that problem before. Those people are the ones who can guide you, help you with that problem the most.

When people need help in solving a problem, they often go to other people for advice. This is because different opinions are better for solving a problem, many opinions are better than one, and other people may have experienced a problem like yours and may be able to guide you in making better decisions. These people will want to help you, and you should allow them to. Next time you have a tough problem to solve, go to others for advice, because they can help you solve it.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
falcon_180b_v1_416,"I believe that students should not have the right to grade their teachers because of several reasons. Firstly, it is unfair to judge a teacher based on the opinions of their students because every student has different preferences and expectations. Some students may like a teacher who is easy-going and doesn't assign too much homework, while others may prefer a more challenging teacher who prepares them for the future. Secondly, students may not always understand the true value of the lessons that their teacher is imparting. They may find a particular class boring or irrelevant, but it could end up being useful in their future career or studies. Lastly, some students may have personal biases against a teacher or may be trying to manipulate their grade through their evaluation.

Furthermore, teachers should be evaluated by trained professionals who know what to look for in a good teacher. These professionals can evaluate teachers based on factors such as how well they communicate with students, how effectively they teach the curriculum, and how they manage their classrooms. This would provide a more accurate and objective assessment of a teacher's performance, and it would also ensure that the evaluation is not influenced by personal biases or preferences.

In conclusion, I believe that students should not have the right to grade their teachers because it is unfair, unreliable, and subjective. A better approach would be to have trained professionals evaluate teachers based on objective criteria, which would provide a more accurate and fair assessment of their performance. Teachers play a vital role in shaping our future, and it is important that they are evaluated properly so that they can continue to provide quality education to their students.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Some people believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers.

CELL PHONE AWAY OR IM GONNA KEEP IT! That's what all teachers say to the students that have there cell phones out and they are right because what do we need with our cell phones in school all of our friends are around us we get to use on the weekends, after school pretty much all the time. When we are in school it is the teacher's time to teach us what we need to know so we can have a good job and not grow stupid and living on the side of the street. Cell phones are one of the main distractions to teens that's why they can't get their homework done, or forget to do their chores. They might not pay attention in class because their probably on FACEBOOK but that's a whole different story. I agree with the teachers one hundred percent because when your in school for seven in a half hours if I'm not mistaken that's it and that's all your teacher need's and some students cannot even do that. It's really getting out of hand because some students get caught and when the teacher asks for the phone then it's a huge issue and it's not the teachers fault because you should have never had your cell phone out in the first place.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
llama_70b_v1163,"I think that meditation and mindfulness practices should be included in schools. It's really important for kids to learn how to relax and manage their stress. I know that when I'm feeling stressed out, it's hard for me to focus in class and I don't do as well on my tests. But when I take a few minutes to breathe deeply and calm my mind, I feel way better and I can focus better.

Also, mindfulness practices like yoga and tai chi can help kids be more aware of their bodies and take care of themselves. My friend's mom is a yoga teacher and she says that it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. If you're feeling tired or sore, you should take a break and rest. This can help prevent injuries and make you feel better overall.

Another reason why meditation and mindfulness practices should be in schools is that it can help kids be more kind and compassionate. When you're feeling calm and centered, you're more likely to be patient and understanding with others. You're not as likely to get angry or frustrated, and you can think more clearly. This can help kids get along better with their classmates and teachers, and it can create a more positive and peaceful school environment.

On the other hand, some people might argue that meditation and mindfulness practices are a waste of time and take away from important learning. But I think that's not true. These practices can actually help kids learn better because they're more focused and calm. And it's not like it takes up a lot of time - just a few minutes a day can make a big difference.

In conclusion, meditation and mindfulness practices should definitely be included in schools. They can help kids manage stress, take care of their bodies, and be more kind and compassionate. It's a simple but effective way to make schools a better place for everyone.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Some schools have implemented meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day.

6075DFB98832,"Recently, I was accepted into the 2nd round of admissions for Generic_School, and the final decision on my acceptance comes soon. Even though this is fantastic news, I still didn't know if I wanted to go, considering how far away it is, the extreme workload, and the fact I would have to make all new friends. I really couldn't make such a monumental decision on my own. It's for that reason that seeking out other's opinions is so important.

Having your opinions validated by others feels great, and it's proven that it actually helps self esteem. A study conducted by the National Psychology Institute found that 73 percent of people tested received a noticeable self esteem boost when their opinions were shared by others. This could lead to more people asking for opinions, and a lot more informed and intelligent decisions. This leads me to ask about people's opinions a lot, as their opinions affect the way I make my decisions.

Asking for multiple people's opinions could help people make healthier decisions. For example, I was skateboarding with some of my friends, and we found a nice hill. It looked pretty scary, but I have been getting a lot more comfortable on my board recently, but I still wanted a second opinion on going down the hill. They told me not to, as they weren't even ready to, even though they had been skateboarding for way longer than I have. I'm glad they told me not to as well, because on further inspection of the hill, I found deep cracks and a hidden speed bump, which would've led to a trip to the hospital. Their opinions saved me from a lot of injury, and I have no doubt the opinions of others have saved a countless number of people from injury.

Asking for an opinion could also help you get other perspectives. When I was trying to find out if Generic_School was worth going to, I asked one of my family friends who actually went to Generic_School. I learned a lot of valuable information from her, like how the scheduling works and the normal workload. It played a huge part in my decision, and it was nice to see the perspective of someone who actually got in and went to the school. On the flip side, there is my cousin, who went to Generic_School, and didn't really enjoy all four years. He told me about the things that really got on his nerves, but I tried my best to recognize what was opinionated and what wasn't. His perspective also had a part in my decision. I appreciated both of their opinions, and it was great to see both sides of the issue.

Ultimately, having other people weigh in is great way to make a better decision. It helped me think through a lot of decisions, and I'm doing a lot better for it. In the end, I decided that if I get in, I would go to Generic_School. Collecting opinions are a critical part of any decision making process, and if you don't get second opinions when you make important decisions, I highly recommend you start.",0,persuade_corpus,,9

953BEF800163,"Completing a full four years of high school before moving on to college can help students build essential skills and gain knowledge for their future. For instance, skills such as better time management, organization, writing, and study techniques can be developed over the four year period. This can help students apply these skills to their college courses, eventually translating into better grades and success. 

On the contrary, leaving high school one year earlier than traditional can be challenging. Without the full four-year curriculum, students may lack the exposure to higher level classes needed to perform well in college. Additionally, early graduation can sometimes hinder self-development, as students may miss out on important milestones that could contribute to maturity level and development. 

For example, one student left high school early in order to take a dual-enrollment course at a local college. By not experiencing a full four years of high school, the student lacked the maturity level and knowledge needed to succeed in college academics. As a result, her grades began to suffer.

It is clear that while leaving high school early can be appealing to some, it is important to consider the effects it may have on a student's future.

Final reason why they shouldnt get this is because it wont benifit any student. its only going to help with one thing and thats to help the teacher figure out who is bored and who isnt. Schools dont need this.

First reason as to why school should not get this new emotional expression technology is because teachers really wont care what one student thinks. The thing will say that you're bored and that their lesson sucks but teachers really wont care what you think because the rest of the class doesnt think that. They might give you extra help but they wont change the way they are teaching just because 1 student is bored.

Another reason why schools should not get this is because their budget. This will probably be very expensive and schools probably cant afford one for each class. The school should also remember that it will only do one thing and thats read emotion. It wont make any student smarter, it''ll just read their emotional expression and its not very useful. Schools shouldnt spend a ton of money on a machine that will only help with 1 thing.

Finaly reason as to why schools shouldnt get this is because this emotional expression machine isnt going to benifit any student. Its only going to read an emotion and nothing else. It wont make anyone any smarter than they already are and its just a waste of time,money, and space.

Schools should not get this new technology because it wont help anyone but the guy who created it. It'll be fun to mess around with but it wont be useful.

4837dc54,"For decades, society has put a major emphasis on transportation in order to center themselves around cars and ways to upgrade them. However, it is this frame of that mind that has created issues for modern society. If there were limitations put on the usage of cars, then those rules would help maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create a feeling of bliss and serenity that has disappeared since the mass production of cars. So unless change is brought upon society, then people will be passing up on benefits that would better the whole world.

Scientist have long realized that cars are a major cause to the pollution brought into society. From the waste produced while turning precious oil into gasoline, to the engines in millions of cars simultaneously burning gas. It is for this reason that limiting the use of cars would assist in saving and maintaining the environment. According to Robert Duffer, the author of the article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Somg"", ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" What is also noteworthy is that this experiment by France officials was only in place for a matter of days. So after having smog that repotedly rivaled Beijing, China, the smog capital of the world, the smog that inhabited France was more than cut in half. If this can work in such a large scale like France, then it isn't unreasonable to believe that this same process can be done in other major regions. Saving the environment has become a priority around the world in recent years, and the idea of limiting the usage of cars could help to achieve that goal.

Aside from the fact that the limitation of cars can save the environment, it can also save car owners money. When a person stops at a gas station to fill up their car, they can expect to spend between twenty and fifty dollars. However, if cars were to become less relevant, then this money can be used to fund other important aspects of a persons life. While this might seem farfetched, according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, ""the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter."" This analysis helps to justify the fact that cars can eventually become less relevant and thus save people money. Also, money would be saved on not having to repair and maintain a car, or having to buy a car in general. This alone can save a carowning household thousands of dollars each year.

Saving the environment and money are always an obvious choice when explaining the benefits of limiting car usage, but another benefit would be obtaining bliss and serenity around the globe. Since the mass producion of cars, cities are always filled with the irritating sounds of a lively road. This has left many people to enjoy their walks, not to the sounds of children laughing and people conversing, but to the beeping and screeching of cars. However, in a city in Germany called Vauban, officials have successfully created a peaceful city that relies on walking and public transportation instead of cars. According to Heiden Walter, a media trainer and citizen in Vauban, ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This quote goes to show that the citizens don't feeled resticted, but released from their reliance on cars. So although it may seem difficult, putting limitations on cars can create a happier populants.

Putting a limitation on the use of cars would not be a punishment like some would see it, but a way to better society. This limitation would help save and maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create bliss and serenity amongst people. As modern society continues to push forward and develop the next wave of advancements, putting limitations on the use of cars should be seen as a serious inquiry to leaders around the world.",0,train_essays,,1
77289E5A15FD,"Imagine you cannot give birth but you can adopt. Seeking multiple opinions can help make a better choice because not every time that your deciding what to do is better, when you decide on something you think about it over and over again so many times, and when you only ask one person they may sometimes not have some advice to give you. It is hard on deciding by yourself, and sometimes its not the best.

It is hard deciding on something, however asking to get multiple advice/opinions is hard too. Multiple pieces of advice are very helpful and can make you more sure of what you are going to do. First of all it depends on the situation you are having. Second, having second guesses on the last minute is very normal since you can't go with one you go to the other. When you really do not have anybody to ask advice to all you could do is maybe go online and do some research, but you could also do it if you have someone.""

Better choices, better plans go to together like ham and cheese.""

This could be one of many things you could have heard when you are asking for advice from other people that you do not talk to a lot or hang out with much.

Different people give very different advice sometimes, Never the less it actualizes between the people you hang out with or talk to the most. Sometimes those trusted persons will find a way to stop you or tell you to not do it or say etc. But you should go for it, the possibilities for it coming true or false is a 50/50 chance. However, keep in mind that people act different when there is something in it for them. So never ever negotiate what it takes to just give you advice since they are too insecure about letting you know what they feel about you. The best choice that you can have are your parents. Some may try to hurt you and some may try to help if they know the struggle you are going through then it will be no problem into helping you.

When you decide something it stays in your file mind until it pops up and says ""alert late notification"" years later ad after that you just do not know what to do and keep it in mind for days or even months, years, decades, etc. It is very strange for a human to do that but there are some cases when there are. It is difficult to human for them to just automatically say yes, when they are in a strained situation. It will not help to make a better choice if you keep thinking about it, it will just get worse. Maybe, when you have found your piece of advice you were looking for just act fast before it is too late. Because when people are trustworthy of the advice and/or opinion they gave you, it will tell when you look at them in the eyes.

It is better seeking multiple opinions because it will help you figure out what you need the most. Now you can do what you think is right with the advice of others combined and act. Also if that person you really trusted is off the chart just tell them you appreciated the advice and break the connection with them. Maybe some of the advice they give you might sound hideous but it is promised that it could have worked later on.

At least it is not hurtful like giving birth, although you cannot. ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
4510E0D4FDEE,"I would like our election to be cast on popular vote. It would make more sense for us to be able to elect our president by what everyone thinks and not the electoral college because many things can go wrong. The votes in electoral college don't make sense big states have more votes then the little ones so the candidates focus on big states and the other ones are left out because they have two or three votes. Thats why I think we need a different system or just cast it on popular vote.

Just like the 2000's election Bush won that by getting the bigger states when Gore should've won it because he had more popular votes. The electoral college makes no sense and should be taken down. Many people disagree with the electoral college and know its a big scam for the presidents to win by losing. Thats why it should be casted on popular so its fair for people and not on the size of your state.

The electoral college is an outdated, unfair system on voting. It shouldn't be about the state but what all of the country thinks. Popular vote is the best way to caculate who should be president and who not to be. Our nation would be better off with a new system because the electoral college is getting outdated and isn't a good way to vote for who leads our country. We need a new system because in several places they never seen a candidate or ad to vote in 2000 campaign. Those states didn't see anything because of their electoral votes are small compared to those of the bigger states.

Also you can tie the votes in electoral votes and then we'd have to worry about the vote our House of Representatives would give us. That could be a disaster for us to worry about. Just like Nixon and Clinton had 43 percent of popular vote but winning in the electoral college. Its not fair for most people and it doesn't make sense how he can win but still be losing at the same time. I wouldn't vote until this system is changed because it is completly unfair.

The electoral college is an unfair system that no one wants anymore. We can change our ways of voting so it'll be more fair and it matters on our country's thoughts not our states. Popular vote seems more reasonable and a better way for us to find a good leader. Thats why i think it should be casted on popular vote instead of the electoral college and the United States of America would be better off with what our whole country thinks instead of our size because we represent freedom and need to prove it.

66fad041,"Since the industrial revolution the demand for cars has grown. Cars have been needed for transport to go to work, school, or just plain traveling. But recently the demand has decreasing. All around the world ""no car suburbs"" popped up and people are dying to move. In source one a German city named Vauban only have 70 percent of families owning cars while 57 percent sold their cars to move to Vauban. This new trend of no automobiles is said to lessen stress, reduce smog greenhouse emissions, and make cities more accessible. ""America's love affair with its vehicles seem to be cooling"" says source four.

Greenhouse emissions wither away with the less cars that ride up and down streets. In Paris, the typical smog reaches to about ""147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter"" stated by source two. This makes it harder for traffic to see and causes an unsafe environment for walking. Paris was said to have banned half of cars one day and another half the other and the smog was cleared enough to rescind the no car rule. Greenhouse emissions, like carbon, can cause acid rain, raises the temperature, and can clog up breathing pathways making it unsafe to go outside when the smog is strong. Carbon can be admitted through the fuel of cars. In France, over 50 percent of cars use diesel fuel which causes a greater amount of greenhouse gas emission. If society can walk or ride bikes to work or school then the amount of automobiles needed will decrease. The lessening number of automobiles can help create a safer and healthier environment.

Not only is the 'no car' trend happening in Europe and developed countries but it is happening all around the world. Source three talks about Bogota, Colombia using a no car program. Once a year Colombia participates in a no car day. ""Million of Colombians hiked, bikes, skates, or took busses to work"". The ones that did not were given a 25 dollar fine. This day in Bogota has gotten so popular that people from other countries have traveled just to witness. The idea of no cars can improve city dynamics. Bogota alone has built 118 miles of bycicle paths. The open area away from cars has created room to build parks and sport areas, restaurants, and shopping centers. While the revenue of cars are decreasing these new areas are increasing in revenue. If using no cars for a day can have this large of an impact in a developing country than it must create a big impact for developed countries.

Even though a no car program can be a huge benefit there are still people disagreeing. A growing crime rate can make it not be safe enough to walk or ride a bycicle to work. For some, work may be to far away to create a short enough walk or ride. Some places, like here in Florida, does not have a transit station close by. But even the idea of carpooling can lessen the the use of cars. Picking up just a couple of friends on the way to work or school can lessen the amount of cars on the road. This can create less traffic and carbon emissions and is safer than walking or riding a bike alone. While some argue that the demand for cars has shrunk due the recession it can also be said that cars may not be the top priority. Source four states that between 2001 and 2009 the amount of young adults driving had decreased by 23 percent.

Wether your on your way to work, school, or practice it would be smart to find another way of transportation. If your new years resolution was to get fit and go to the gym, ride your bike or run to work. Bicycling and walking can create a healthier you. Cars have done more harm that good to the environment but it is not too late to change that. We can use places like France, Germany, and Colombia as a great example of a new way to change life. Lets do ourselves a favor and maybe pick up a buddy on the way to work, or ride a bike, take the train, or walk. Lets take part in the new trend of no automobiles.",0,train_essays,,3
A6B20075B2A5,"Imagine you're drowning, then someone gives you a baby to take care of, it's name is ""soccer practice"". Some students already have other things to do, they don't need to balance more in their day. A forced school activity is sometimes too much for students who already are not doing so well in school and at home. Why I feel we don't need a mandatory extracurricular activity is for students that take care of siblings, too much homework, and it's stressful.

Taking care of a sibling is hard enough, to put a sports practice on top of that is harder. I take care of my younger brother at home, he is in 6th grade but I still make him do his homework before I can do mine. Adding another activity to my after school day would mean that my brother probably won't do his work until I get home. A mandatory activity would mean me suffering, not sleeping enough because of my brother, then being tired at school, then not doing well at practice and going home to just sleep ignoring my brother, he would be most affected because of this.

Homework is another thing entirely different thing. I mentioned my brother not doing his homework until I get home, but I can't do my homework until he is done. I have to then do my homework later and later, forcing my to sleep less and less, which is definently not good for you. activities push back what is already pushed back. It is also not that fun to do homework at 11 pm.

Stress is something very relevant, most teens experience some degree of stress sometime in school, whether in a project or a speech. while trying to balance school and home life, the added stress of doing well in that sport, club or band can tip students over the ""edge"". I experience a lot of stress about school, one more thing to worry about might make me go bald at 40.

In reality this plan of a mandatory activity is just too much for me and for my peers. You can think whatever you want about this topic but feel there is no way that plan would have positive feedback. It seems to me like it only causes problems.

5EAB1A9FABE8,"What are your thoughts of the ""Face on Mars""? I think it is just a natural land form. I think it's just a landform becuase Earth has it's own form like mountains, so it could just be a mountain. There could be other theories that it isn't a landform, but I think that's what it is and here is why. Earth has techtonic plates, Mars might too, so far, we haven't found existing life on any other planets other than earth so Martians couldn't have built something like the pyramids.

To start off, Earth has techtonic plates we have known about them for many years and we know that the plates are always moving. With the plates always moving that's what formed the Himalaya Mountains and is what casuses them to continue getting taller. I think the ""Face"" on Mars is just and example of techtonic plates that are costantly moving and making the ""Face"" more definant every few years. Just the same way as the Himalayan Mountains not every year do we see a direct change in height with just our eyes. We have to measure it out to find out how much those plate techtonics have moved. That is what I believe is happening with the face, I think that since we aren't able to view it every year and measure how much more defiant it is that the year before or if it has even changed.

There's two sides to every argument here's the other side. If the face hasn't changed we could just asume there was life on mars that built it, but as technology increases and we can have a better view of the face and see how much more defiant it was from 1976-2001. It would be a more logical idea to think that it is just the planet moving or plates shifting. SInce on April '98 it was a cloudy day and winter perhaps alien markings were hidden by the clouds.

Although, as I continued reading in the passage, on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia they were able to get a second looke at the Face. In 2001 the resolution was much better and you could see the image more clearly. Garvin said, ""As a rule of thumg, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the airplanes on the ground or the Egyptian-style pyraminds or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The picture actually shows the Martian equalicant of a butte or mesa landforms common around the West in America. Since the photo can go up to high amounts of resolution and we should be able to see of there is proof of Marian life and their buildings, I don't think a real thing. RIght now the face looks like a natural land form.

To conclude my argument that the face is just a natural landform, I would have to say even though, there are some conspircy theories only one thing can be proven to be correct in science. Earrth has techtonic plates and so there's a great chance Mars does to, then only thing that could lead anyone to belive there was life on Mars would be the one photo that was taken in April of '98 when it was cloudy and winter. Lastly, there hasn't been any evidenve of life on Mars or any other planet, so therefore it was just a natural landform on the planet. ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
falcon_180b_v1_207,"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you about the idea of requiring all students to perform community service. I think that this is a great idea and I support it.

Firstly, community service is a great way for students to give back to their community. It helps students to understand the importance of helping others and to develop a sense of responsibility towards their community. For example, my friend Sarah volunteers at the local food bank and she says that it feels really good to know that she is making a difference in people's lives.

Secondly, community service can also help students to develop important skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership. These skills are important for success in school and in life. For example, my friend John volunteers at a local animal shelter and he says that he has learned how to work with others and to communicate effectively.

Finally, community service can also be a great way for students to explore their interests and passions. For example, my friend Emily volunteers at a local library and she says that she has discovered a love for books and reading that she never knew existed.

I understand that some students may feel that community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. However, I believe that the benefits of community service far outweigh the costs. By requiring all students to perform community service, we can create a culture of giving back and responsibility towards our community.

Thank you for considering my opinion.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Some of your friends perform community service. For example, some tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter.

E64E850E6E71,"Perhaps you are trying to decide which college or university you should go to or what outfit you should wear to a high school graduation. After pondering between your variables, you would ask your family, friends, or mentors for their opinions so you can make better choices. People sometimes talk to more than one person when seeking advice, to make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone come to a smarter decision because of the variety of opinions that they are given, and an individual choice you can make out of those opinions.

When you ask for opinions on which university you should go to after your high school graduation, the answers between your parents and the answers from your friends might be different. Your parents could say that UVA is better than a college in New York or California because its close to home. They could also say that UVA is instate, which means its less expensive. Meanwhile, your friend might say that the college in New York is better than UVA, because you get to experience the freedom of living in a completely new place while making your own decisions. They could say that places like New York and California is way more fun than staying in your hometown. When you ask for advice from multiple people instead of just one person, you get a variety of opinions and perspectives to help you to make the right decision.

When you are given multiple opinions on the choice you are trying to make, like which university you should go to, you gain more information on both of the schools your trying to decide between. All of that information helps you to find what you want out of a school. When given multiple opinions, you can decide if your willing to live with all that freedom and responsibility in somewhere like New York City, and if your ready for it. Or you can confirm to yourself that your not ready to leave to somewhere completely different and far away, and you can't afford an out of state university. Those opinions can help you eliminate a variable, by thinking, ""Am I ready for what that person is advising?"" Ultimately, you are making your own decision, with others helping you realize your strengths and weaknesses, and what your opinion is.

Through the advice and opinions that you receive from multiple people, you can decide and make a better choice individually. Each person that you ask for advice to will answer differently, and out of all of those opinions, you can create your own opinion and find out what variable is better for you. Other peoples opinions are helping you decide and realize what you want out of something, so you can make a better choice.             ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
F45DA946AC14,"Splash! The bucket of paint hits the canvas as soon the extra class starts. I would like to agree with the decision of an extra class for all students to at least participate in one extra activity. An example for an extra class is like to design in the yearbook,learning art,and making new friends.

First of all,designing in the yearbook for the whole school to see would be an outstanding work of art. Helping out for the yearbook could be fun in many ways and taking lovely photos of people as they have fun as well. Doing the yearbook means that the students can also cast a vote on the colors and the font on the yearbook. One of the most important part of the yearbook is the theme, like for spring and summer or even the school mascot.

Secondly, learning art is also fun to have for an extra class and getting to experience a new feeling to learn more about the activity. Having art class could interest other students to join or having art cast their future job. Learning for an extra class can improve on a students skill or there love for art, and to give the students an opportunity to show off their talents for the whole school to see one day.

Third of all, having a new class to go to could help out some students to make new friends and build there trust more. Team bonding is also a way to make new friends and help each other out to learn from each other. Having new friends can also lead into a group project, and build up the trust that students can make. Students can have similar skills, like to paint in the same or close style, and may also think the same idea as one another student has.

Lastly, having an extra event for students is a fantastic idea and making school a bit more exciting to go, giving the students an opportunity to choose what they are going to be in the future.

DD637A4E40F2,"Some schools instead of letting students have a break during the summer, instead make the students complete summer projects. Why schools do this is for the students to continue thinking and learning during the break. Most schools have the teachers design these projects, but the real way they should do it is by having students design them. The reason it should be this way is because it will encourage students to think for themselves, will let students learn and practice a topic they are interested in, and for the fact that a student can learn in a way helpful to them.

Independent thinking is a virtue that every single person should have. But sadly independent thinking is not something students get to practice very often. But summer projects that students get to design themselves is a perfect way for students to build and improve this skill greatly. Rather than the student half heartily completing a project that a teacher designed, the student would instead think up and complete a project themselves and will learn a great deal in the process. For example when I was in Tenth grade my history teacher had my class complete a project based on World War One, and those where the only instructions. If it had been a simple project where we each had to make a poster board for an event during the war. Instead each person in my class designed a project entirely their own. One person did a poster on trench warfare, another person came up with a song about how the war was started. I came up with a game that showed how hard it was to prevent the war. This project encouraged each person in that class to think for themselves and we were all better for it.

Having to complete a project about a boring topic can be brutal. One reason is that when people are not interested in something they can have a hard time doing it. A student designed summer project could be a perfect solution for this. The reason being is that instead of a student struggle to complete a project they don't care about, the student can and learn and practice a topic they are passionate about. For instance one time in my Filmmaking Class I got to complete an independent project on anything I wanted. My project was a film about cars, and for my entire life I have always loved cars and car movies. In doing this project I finally got to make my own car movie and in doing so I learned about a great deal about cars and film making it self. From how to make cars interesting to a viewer to how to film inside of one. This was an opportunity I was incredibly thankful for and will help me in my future of film making

One could say that if a student is given too much free reign on a project during the summer they will not complete the project or will make a half baked one. This is not true as all people and all students learn differently and require different needs and when given the time and resources will make something great. For example for me they best way to learn is by doing it through something I am passionate about. Like I love to bake and in my eighth grade civics class I got to make a cake about Presidential elections and because of they way I got to learn about it I still remember it to this day. This could be possible for every student if the project was more fitted for the students needs because that F average student could really be just struggling to learn and not out of laziness not completing the project but out of confusion or shame. As well as these projects would be during the summer the student would have even more time to practice and learn.

Summer projects that students themselves are a great way for students to learn. From promoting independent thinking, to having the student learn about a topic they are interested in, and the student getting to learn in a way helpful to them. These could really help students in getting ready for a new school year and the rest of their lives as these are skills not easily forgotten.

That is why schools should let student design their summer projects themselves.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
1B069ADEF513,"The student council is holding a meeting at the cafeteria while the school basketball team is practicing for their upcoming game. These things are called extracurricular activities. The principle has decided these things are mandatory. I think students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because students schedules and students being forced to do something they dont want to do.

Lots of students have busy lives. Students and their parents could have something planned or reserved for a certain time.( going to parties, a get together, vacations/trips, shopping etc.) The activity and plan might collide, which probably would cause rescheduling and chaos. Students could also already have an activity outside of school. How I see it in my mind is that if someone already takes a sport (outside of school) and now has to take another activity in school. They would have less time, less motivation, and more work. Our four core classes and two electives already give us plenty of homework to do. Doing an activity will require more effort and less time to do the homework from our classes. Whether it be a writing assignment for the student council, doing work for the yearbook club or practicing for a sport.

Students may feel forced to do an activity they dont like. For some kids their might not be an activity they enjoy and then proceed to pick one they dont like. Doing this could make them resent school or feel some type of sadness. Their also could be a large demand for one activity a student has applied for. After applying the student learns hes been excluded because of maximum limit of people in one club. The student is now in a club he doesn't enjoy. If I was in the student shoes i would feel like the school has been unfair or betrayed me. Being forced to do something is almost never a good thing. especially if you don't enjoy it. Forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do could cause a state of depression, anxiety or a fear of it.

However, participating in extracurricular activities would mean less screen time. Students can socialize and plus most teenagers are addicted to their phones and its not healthy for them at all. Doing activities will decrease the time by a good percentage. Being addicted to anything is definitely not healthy but, being forced to do something isnt either. In my opinion more screen time is better than doing something you resent because you are enjoying it and you are also technically socializing by messaging or calls. All in all lots of screen time may not be healthy, but its better than participating in activity you dont like.

In conclusion it shouldn't be mandatory to be in an extracurricular activity because of the schedules of students and being forced to do something you dont want to do. Activities will interfere with these things causing chaos and even resenting school. This is my honest opinion on this decision. If you take the time to think about this decision, you'll realize whos going to be effected and how they are going to be effected. This is why I disagree about having to participate in extracurricular activities.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
A9544F0E8868," First impressions are critical in determining how others perceive you, and they can be difficult to change once formed. When meeting a new person or family member, people judge based on how they act and speak. For instance, if a woman applies for a new job and speaks rudely to the manager, her behavior and attitude will impact her chances of being hired. Therefore, it is essential to consider what you say and how you say it, as it can have a significant impact on your life and the lives of those around you.

First impressions are not only formed by the person being judged but can also leave a lasting impression on others. When people are giving a first impression, it is crucial to present a clear and positive image. If the first impression is negative, it can be challenging to change it later. Therefore, it is essential to be mindful of your behavior and attitude when meeting new people, as it can impact how they perceive you in the future.

One way to make a positive first impression is by noticing the behavior and attitude of the person you are meeting. For example, when meeting a new employee at work, it is essential to introduce yourself and engage in conversation. If you fail to do so, it can be perceived as unfriendly or uninterested. However, when meeting new people, it is essential to be friendly and engaging, as it can help build relationships and create a positive first impression.

Lastly, giving a positive first impression can have a significant impact on how others perceive you and how you are treated. When people have a positive first impression of you, they are more likely to approach you with kindness and respect. This can lead to more opportunities and better relationships in the future. Therefore, it is essential to be kind and generous to others, as it can have a ripple effect on the world around you.

In conclusion, first impressions are critical in determining how others perceive you, and they can be difficult to change once formed.

89FCD2B81990,"The whole purpose of democracy is to create a government that reflects the desires, opinions, and attitudes of the people being governed, but how can this be achieved if the people aren't fairly represented during election time, presidential or otherwise? This is the problem with the Electoral College system; it puts all of decision-making power in the hands of our electors, not the citizens themselves. To begin with, the electors selected by citizens are capable of defying the will of the people they were chosen to represent. Next, in the case of a tie, the opinions of millions of people would be overlooked. Finally, because the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on obtaining votes instead informing all voters about their intentions, only the influential ""swing"" states receive enough attention from candidates to make a well-informed decision when voting. When it comes to something as serious as the fate of our country, citizens cannot put their faith in the such a corrupt system as the Electoral College.

First of all, the Electoral College system creates a window of opportunity for ""faithless"" electors to take advantage of the power given to them by society during the voting process. Under the Electoral College, voters do not vote directly for who they want as president, but instead for a slate of electors, who in turn select the president. Although these electors may pledge themselves to a particular candidate, there is no way to determine whether or not they end up casting their vote according to the will of the people who put them in charge. Such an unpredictable turn of events could be avoided if only the outcomes of presidential elections were determined by popular vote, not through an Electoral College.

Secondly, if a tie were to occur, the opinions of countless citizens would be ignored. In this case, the election would be thrown to the House of representatives, were delegates from each state would vote on the president. Since each state has only one vote to cast, a vote from a state containing 500,000 people would carry the same weight as a vote representing the opinions of 35 million. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the selection made by the House of Represenatives can hardly be expected to respesent the will of the people.

falcon_180b_v1_584,"There has been an ongoing debate about the benefits and drawbacks of vegetarian and vegan diets. The primary argument against meat-based diets is its negative impact on the environment and personal health. However, while there are certainly valid concerns regarding the environmental and health impact of meat consumption, I believe that adopting a purely vegetarian or vegan diet is not necessary.

One argument in favor of a vegetarian or vegan diet is the environmental impact that meat consumption has on the planet. The livestock industry is responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, raising animals for food requires a substantial amount of land and water, contributing to deforestation and water scarcity. However, it's important to consider that not all types of meat are equal in terms of environmental impact – for example, sustainably farmed seafood is often considered a healthy and eco-friendly choice.

Another argument against meat consumption is the negative impact on personal health. High levels of red meat consumption have been linked to a variety of health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. However, a balanced omnivorous diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can provide all necessary nutrients for a healthy lifestyle.

Furthermore, a vegan or vegetarian diet does not guarantee a healthier or more eco-friendly lifestyle. Processed foods, including many meat substitutes, often contain high levels of sodium, sugar, and unhealthy fats. Additionally, some plant-based foods may require a great deal of water and energy to produce, such as avocado and certain nuts.

In my opinion, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is an individual choice that can certainly have positive effects. Still, it's not necessary to completely eliminate meat from the diet to achieve health or sustainability goals. A balanced omnivorous diet that prioritizes whole grains, fruits, and veggies, and sustainably farmed meat, fish, and dairy can be a healthier and more eco-friendly option.

In conclusion, the decision to become a vegetarian or vegan should be a personal choice. It is essential to consider the environmental and health impacts of meat consumption, but it is equally important to remember that a balanced omnivorous diet can also be sustainable and healthy.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"There is a growing movement advocating for the reduction of meat consumption due to environmental and health concerns.

62EA3F855DB2,"When seeking opinions and advice, it is often beneficial to ask more than one person. This is because different people have different perspectives and expertise, and by comparing their responses, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand. However, there are also potential risks and disadvantages to seeking advice from a single source. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and risks of seeking advice from multiple sources, and provide an example of a situation in which I asked for help from multiple people.

One of the main benefits of seeking advice from multiple sources is the ability to gain a more diverse range of perspectives. Each person has their own unique experiences and knowledge, and by seeking out their opinions, we can gain a more well-rounded understanding of the issue at hand. For example, if we are trying to decide on a career path, seeking advice from a teacher, a family member who has a successful career, and a friend who is just starting out in their field can provide us with a variety of different perspectives to consider.

Another benefit of seeking advice from multiple sources is the ability to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issue. By comparing the responses of different people, we can identify areas of agreement and disagreement, and gain a better understanding of the factors that are most important. For example, if we are trying to decide on a college major, seeking advice from a teacher who specializes in that major, a family member who has experience in that field, and a friend who is currently studying that major can provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of the pros and cons of each major.

However, there are also potential risks and disadvantages to seeking advice from a single source. One of the main risks is that we may not be aware of all of the potential perspectives and expertise that are available to us. For example, if we only seek advice from a teacher who specializes in one area, we may not be aware of the perspectives and expertise of other teachers or professionals in that field. This can lead to a narrow and limited understanding of the issue at hand.

Another risk of seeking advice from a single source is that we may be influenced by the biases and perspectives of that person. For example, if we only seek advice from a family member who has a certain political or religious viewpoint, we may not be aware of other perspectives and may be influenced by their biases",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0
37A2E6EA2337,"When people ask others for advice, they tend to talk to more than one person. To get more guidance from others that could possible lead them the right way. Seeking advice from other people can help because their advice can lead you in the right direction and there are challenges that we all go through in life.

Their advice can lead you in the right direction. Seeking God for help. Yes, I know most people don't believe in god and it is okay, but for those who do God makes things happen for a reason. He takes people out of your life and gives you advice even when you don't ask. You may not know when he does, but he does. Also, family knows best. Other than yourself, family should be the closest people to you and they know more about you then others. Their guidance can rub off on you. Lastly, friends. Lots of people go to friends about things that worry them or things they want to talk about. Friends can help you with experience that they or someone they know has went through. Even if you don't think so, all these people in your life always know what's best for you and are good people to go to when you need them.

There are challenges that we all go through in life. People with the same experience. You may not know or haven't asked, but some people that you are close with have probably gone through the same experience you have and can help you through whatever you are going through. Being comfortable with others. I feel as if that is a big key in seeking advice from others, you should be comfortable with them. Be able to trust them and tell them things without the fear of them telling someone else. Lastly obstacles. There isn't a day in life where we haven't all had an obstacle we had to face. No, I'm not talking about like playground obstacles I mean real life ones. Like challenges, bad experiences we've had to face. I would never want to got through a bad experience alone and would want to seek someone else for help. You may not think anyone can help you, but it's more than just a 3 step process.

However, I understand how others may not care, or don't give the right advice at times and make every experience you have about to them. That has happened to me many times. Yet, no one knows you better than you know yourself. It is scientifically proven that no one knows you better then you know yourself. About 65% of people go to others about their problems.

Getting advice from others is better though because their advice can lead you in the right direction and there are challenges we all go through in life. At the end of the day try to always get advice from someone other than yourself, you never know what will happen.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
2AF0D4565FBC,"Have you ever thought there was a possiblity of going to venus? Yeah i didnt either but i completly agree with the autors point of view on this article i agree about going to venus for more information cause it would help us understand what happened to venus and if one point and time it was like earth.

The challenge of going to venus with anything is its massive air pressure, solfuric acid rain, and really hot surface temptures and we currently dont have anything to actually be able to survive those condtions for more then maybe three weeks or less so what i say we do is that we look at metals that are restiant to stuff like that and see if we could try combining the atoms to make an alloy.

In conclusion in my personal opionion i think yes we should try a little harder to get to know more about venus cause it would explain a kot and tell us if one day it was like earth and what happened to it so we could avoid it so that doesnt happen to earth and on top of that the more we learn about it the more the possiblity of it maybe becoming a hospital planet to go to if we need to ever move off of earth.

llama_70b_v1543,"I think that stronger privacy protections on social media are totally necessary. Like, imagine if your parents or teachers could see everything you post online? That would be super embarrassing and not cool at all. It's important to have some things that are just for you and your friends, you know?

Plus, there are a lot of people who use social media to bully or harass others. If there were stronger privacy protections, it would be harder for those people to find and target their victims. It's not right that people should have to deal with that kind of stuff just because they want to share some funny memes or whatever.

Also, have you heard about all the data breaches and stuff that happen on social media? It's like, your personal information is out there for anyone to see! That's not okay. We should be able to trust that our private info is safe and secure.

I know some people might argue that privacy protections would infringe on our freedom of speech or something, but I don't think that's true. We can still have the freedom to share what we want, but we should also have the right to control who sees it. It's all about balance, you know?

8993D20E44A6,"As crazy as living without a car sounds, more and more people are doing it. One popular reason for it is for a healthier and happier lifestyle. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's short story titled In

German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

Heidrun Walter reports ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Her and many others like her in the town of Vauban, Germany have experienced the difference and felt stress go away. The city has banned driveways and home garages, encourging the rule of living ""car-free."" The people rely on public transit, bicycles and their own two legs. While many people are stressing to get a car, the people of the town feel stressed if they have a car. Over half the population sold their cars to move there, and don't regret a thing. In the article titled

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , Andrew Selsky quotes Carlos Arturo Plaza as saying ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

Also Carlos Arturo Plaza goes on to say ""[it's a good oppurtinity to] lower air pollution."" People are realizing how many pollutants that cars emitt into the atmosphere. One example place is Paris, known for their terrible smog, has finally done something to clean it up. Robert Duffer wrote in

Paris bans driving due to smog

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The law stated even numbered license plates couldn't drive one day, and the other, odd liscense plates couldn't. A little thing like this had a big effect. Duffer then reported ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" Elizabeth Rosenthal in the aritcle

The End of Car Culture showed the idea "" if [these] patterns persists...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" Americans are partically to blame for pollution. Our need for the newest, biggest, best things, has come at a cost, and more than money. Green-house gases are stacking up, and we have to take a stand some time. Rosenthal goes on to describe political leaders are working to fix this too, ""President Obama's abitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions [were] unveiled last week.""

In places already practicing the no car rule, environments have improved; more than pollution wise. Andrew Selsky reported of ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and  ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" These two additions of Bogota, Colombia have inspired many people to turn in their keys, and take a hike instead. Not only have these changes made people more happy, but it makes their city more beautiful and they are starting to get outdoors and see it. The author reports that ""municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event [car-free day] and were enthuriastic,"" amung the people visiting was the Mayor of Paraguay's capital city. When more people see the effects, they want to do the same thing. Columbia's one day event has brought about much talk in neighboring towns and even ""two other Colombian cities, Calli and Valledupar, joined the event.""

On the other side of the argument, many car industries are trying to compete with these new ideas and technology. Rosenthal quotes in

The End Of Car Culture

""But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"" As humans advance into the ideas of walking, biking, or taking public transportation, car companies strive to become known for things other than cars. They want to be able to sell you things still, even if you don't want or need a car. Later she writes how Bill Ford proposed the fresh idea at the Mobile World Congress that car dealers should ""partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" This long quote simply means having all forms of transportion and the new technology in communications to be one, for the better of the people.

With or without cars, we all are always on the move. Some cities have adapted new ideas to get from place to place, or simply old ideas, being put back into action. Although Henry Ford would probably be dissapointed at his invention being faded out, Mother Nature would be pleased of us taking care of Earth. We never know what the future holds, but we do know, we'll always only have one home, so we better take care of it.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
84AD2A5BF53E,"The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral college process consits of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes byCongress. The Electoral College consits of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for thePresident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows much worse. Considering thst the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, end that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy wouldn't have actually gone to Kennedy.)

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the argument against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: ""Abolish the electoral college!""

AB75D2DC92B7,"Schools were made for people who wants to learn and be a successful person in life even though , there are some people who don't have the opportunity to be in school. Right now in some countries be on school until you are 18 is a law but it other countries government those not care about children future. Here in the United States they have the option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. They have that option specially on universities because some universities are out of the city and a percentage of students with a bad economy may not be viable to get transportation everyday. So In my opinion that is a great idea to have that option on universities. They should have the same option in high school but not to all the students because that may cause students to fail the classes. High school 's should give that option to students with excellent notes and for students who live out of town. Attend classes from home by online or videos has benefits, oneis you become more responsible,

second it helps you to earned money, and gives you more opportunities to success.

In one hand,Attend classes from home it may be a big responsibility because you are doing it by your own no one is going to help you or push you to learn. For example when you attend to class in a school or colleague there is always a teacher ,who is there to help you,supports you ,and make sure you don't fail your semester, they also make sure that you are learning and getting better everyday. Instead when you have to attend classes by yourself you must be confident and responsible to make sure that you are going to take classes everyday and don't waste the opportunity,because no one is going to be telling you more than 3threet times to do you work .There are some students that don't know what be a responsible person means, does students may not be viable to get good greats by taking classes from home. This kind of students need help from someone to push them and teach them to be a responsible person. Be a responsible person is important because it helps you to success in life gives more opportunities and you don't depend from nobody you learn how to do things by your own.

In the other hand one more benefit to attend classes by home in online it helps you to earn money specially if you live in large distance from school. A few houses are located miles away from the city that means schools are located miles a way from home. In that case attend classes from school it would be very helpful and a big opportunity. Because take transportation everyday Monday to Friday it may be expense because you may pay at mornings to get to school and pay back in the afternoon to go back home. One more benefit is that it help you to success,you may be a viable to find a job. For example you can do your online classes in the mornings and find a part-time in the afternoon. Many students do this they go to school on mornings and work for a couples of hours at night. But if you could attend classes from home it would be so much easier to work and study at the same time you would made your own schedule withou a problem. Also make sure to give enough of time to do your online classes and get good greats.

In conclusion

I do believe this potion to attend classes from home in online or videos is a great opportunity. Specially for students who live out of the city and for everyone who was to success in life no matter what. School and universities should let students know about this option. I am agree and I believe that I may not be the only one who support this idea. Therefore this opportunity should give to students who really needs it and no to those who would waste it .This kind of option should be in all over the world to help people with bad economy and help those who want to success and have a passion to learn. Students who have the opportunity to attend school everyday without a problem should know that there is people that live far from the city that they would love to be seated in a classroom and attend school everyday.",0,original_moth,Task: Research the benefit of attending classes from home online or by video conference.

On May 24 2001, a NASA spacecraft discovered a shadow in the shape of a human face. Some scientist believed that the face was caused by aliens, but many others believed that it was just a natural landform. Mesa's and butte's are two types of natural landforms. They are very common around Cydonia.

Around May, NASA put the image on the interenet for everyone to view. The caption of the picture said it was a huge rock with the ILLUSION of a face. An illusion is a when someone plays a trick on your eyes,this means it could look like a face but be an mesa. The way a person sees something is based on their own perspective. If one scientist sees a alien shape,another person sees a human face,and the other see a rock it is based on their point of view.

The picture caught alot of attention even by the chief scientist of NASA""s Mars Exploration Program,Jim Gavin. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team came to take pictures of Mars. The used a camera that had better quality than the Viking spacecraft. MOC's picture proved that the Face was only a natural landform. There were people who still thought it was analien so they took another picture. They used a camera that would make the image 3 times its pixel size, this means that if their was anything or size you would see is.

In the end,pictures proved that the Face shaped like a human's turned out to be just a butte or a mesa which was common. Many people are disappointed, but scientist have proven thier theory of ancient civilization on the Red Planet is incorrect. The Face still remains on the planet Mars. There are still many parts of the world that are yet to be discovered. Who knows what is out there?",0,persuade_corpus,,6
553B7DD398EE,"I believe that the so called face on Mars is just a landform. One reason i believe this is because everytime we took a picture of the ""face"" it looked different. This is because the shadows are at different lengths throughout the day. It also looks different each time because the cameras where becoming more advanced and the images are having less and less pixels.

The reasons i believe that the landform on mars is a landform because shadows change how the object looks, the cameras were bad and were very pixelated making parts of the photograph look blurry, and mesas are very common in Cydonia. Like on Earth shadows can make objects look like something they aren't. Like I said mesas are very common in the area so there is a good chance that it is a mesa.

Because of this information thats supports the claim that the face is a mesa i believe that the claim is true. The technology over the time of taking the photos became more advanced therefore the cameras were able to take less pixelated images. When the last image was posted to a website in 2001 many of the people who thought the landform was a face or an alien artifact stopped believing. One scientist said that if there where buildings or aircraft on the surface that cameras would show if it was real or fake.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

The picture shows us a part of Mars where the face is just form in that weird way. Makin people think there was aliens on Mars. Mars is not a liveable place. There is no air to breathe, and it is to hot. You wouldn't make it alive in Mars, because you would lose your breath and burn up.

All the picture is show us is that a natural landform has formed on Mars. It is a great picture off landform you might never see again, but it has nothing to do with aliens on Mars. If aliens were real, one of

NASA'S scientists would have found them in outer space by now. The face is just a great form of natural landform.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

If you put policy one in our school you would never have to worry about hat again. In fact, if you bring policy one into our school you would have students would pay more attention in class, students being able to call their parents if something was wrong, and if a student forgot something they could call someone.

When students are in school it is totally different than being at home. When we are at home we text our friends and are always on our phones, but when we come to school we have to turn our phones off and not use them. Students are always tempted to text during class so if you let us text during lunch it relives that temptation. Policy one would help us so that is why it is a good idea.

If there was a tragedy during school and a student was hurt and you couldn't hear them what would help them? A cell phone because they could call for help to save them. If a student did not have the cell phone then they may have no way to call for help. I think policy one would help you so that no one would get hurt.

If you are in class about to go to a different class and remember that you forgot something at home that you needed you could call a parent during lunch to get them to bring it and not get a bad grade. If you have policy one that would happen. I think that if you had policy two then you would have worse grades and have a higher drop out rate. You do not want that, do you?

All in all, i think that it would be beneficial to you if you had policy one not two. you should seriously consider using policy one. Policy one is thee better choice and it would be better for students.

Sincerely,

I believe that we should be aloud to have phones during lunch because well people have them out anyway. Were also kids we love to text and sometimes talk to our parents or grandparents or someone like that. Some students may also be shy to talk to the people who go to our school. Its just something that takes some time to find out

I also agree that we shouldn't because well harassment could go on or people could tell there friends to bring a gun or something to school or even drugs. Yea it is fun to have our phones out but we don't need to focus our lives on phones some people around the countrys aren't lucky enough to have phones.

I say people shouldn't waist there time on phones get out and do something. There are allot of people who cant move a bone in there body we should be thankful we can. God gave us gifts one of my gifts is softball and gymnastics those sports i love doing but you cant do them with a phone in your hand. well you could but it would be hard of dangerous.

Phones have got ton me in trouble may many of times. One year i was playing softball worming up the pitchers arm for the game i didn't have any gear on not even a face mask to protect my face well my phone rang in my pocket and i was so exited to see what it was. So i looked at the text well the pitcher didn't know that at the time she pitched it and it hit me right in the eye knocked off my glasses and gave me a black eye.

So, i mean there are many good things about it and many bad things you just have to be smart about what you do. Many people already text in school but teachers done know that and yes there has been rude comets on them but its part of life.

You are our principal and we respect you, you've made great disitions for us just keep shooting them out at us were ready for you.

Dear: TEACHER_NAME

how are you? i just took some time to write you this letter you need to know about.

I am writing you a letter to describe to you i think the better policy, policy 2 one reason is because, phones are not allowed in the school in the first place, phones are a disturbing materials for class and its better to not have phones in school at all. Even though school allows them to have phones students will still turn them on and use them during class. Also some students use phone during reading time when they are in the library when supposable the teacher is teaching them and behind her back many kids are texting with their phones . Another occasions kids usually need to be doing their work but they are instead texting. i believe policy 2 is better for the school not to allow students have phones at school at all. if you have any questions please contact me as soon as you can at PHONE_NUMBER

One of the things the is keeping people so interested is that Venus at one time was supposedly the most Earth like planet in our solar system.

We have tried to explore Venus multiple times but the explorations have been un named because after a few our the spacecrafts broke or quit on us. We think that this is because of Venuses harsh envirnement constisting of acid rain and clouds, the hottest surface temprature in our Milky Way, and the fact that it is so hard to catch the planet when it is close to our planet. ""Also notteble Venus has the hottest surface temprature of any planet in the solar system, even though mercury is the closest to the Sun"". Thats a reason why we cant land and stay there. One of the reasons we believe Venus used to be like Earth is because of its nottable past. ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"".

0a11dfd8,"The United States has been known for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but that's not all. It's also known for the different freedoms made available and its fair government. The electoral college is a system in which states choose representatives to vote on the president. In the past, there was a big debate on whether or not this process was fair. The electoral college is not fair or trustworthy for many reasons.

Imagine that you picked a representative who said they were going to vote for the person you wanted for president. Sadly, they ended up changing their mind. You could end up with a president you don't like or believe in. Voters don't have total control over who their electors vote for. To me, that doesn't sound very fair. If everyone were allowed to vote, the people would be able to ensure that there vote counted towards the person they wanted, and not towards the candidate they were against. Based on multiple polls, a few presidents have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote. That means that the candidate which was chosen by the people did not become president. Our founding fathers fought hard for our rights, and it's our right to a fair vote.

There are more problems than just an unfair vote. It almost sounds impossible that there could be a tie in a presidential election, but it has almost happened before. In the past, votes have been so close that only a couple thousand have separated the victor from the loser. What would happen if the votes came out to be tied in an election? Who would become president? I'm sure some people could argue that the electoral college could fix this problem, but I don't believe it could. Since there are less people making the decision during the electoral college process, it is even more likely that there could be a tie. If one person were to vote another way, it could be the equivalent of 1,000 people voting the other way. Also, during the electoral college the electors recieve rewards if their candidate wins. The people in that state, or even the whole country supported the electors and helped them make their decision, so they deserve recognition too.

The electoral college is not a fair or trustworthy process. Americans have no control over which candidate their electors choose to vote for. Also, there is a better chance for a catastrophic tie. America is all about being fair and giving people the opportunities they deserve. So, let's give Americans the chance for a fair vote.",0,train_essays,,3

8A2A9C25B642,"Listening to different opinions is crucial in order to make informed decisions and broaden our perspectives. When we only listen to one viewpoint, we limit our understanding of a topic and may miss out on important information. By exposing ourselves to a variety of opinions, we can gain a deeper understanding of the issue at hand and make more informed decisions.

It is also important to avoid being biased when listening to different opinions. Our biases can cloud our judgment and make us more likely to dismiss opposing viewpoints. By actively listening and trying to understand the other person's perspective, we can overcome our biases and make more objective decisions.

In order to make good decisions, it is important to gather as much information as possible. This includes listening to different opinions, researching the topic, and considering the potential consequences of our actions. By using these strategies, we can make well-informed decisions that take into account all relevant factors.

Constructive criticism is an important part of the decision-making process. When someone offers constructive criticism, they are providing valuable feedback that can help us improve our decision-making. By listening to and considering this feedback, we can make better decisions and avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

Finally, relying on the knowledge of others can be incredibly valuable when forming opinions. By seeking out the opinions of experts or those with more experience in a particular area, we can gain valuable insights and make more informed decisions. By using this strategy, we can avoid making mistakes and make more informed decisions.

In conclusion, listening to different opinions, avoiding bias, gathering information, considering constructive criticism, and relying on the knowledge of others are all important strategies for making good decisions.

7D955FAD0C73,"Hey there! 

Okay, so I know this essay is supposed to be like, super formal and stuff, but I'm gonna try my best to make it sound like I actually wrote it. 

So, the prompt is all about how important it is to stay engaged and participate in activities. Like, it's super duper important. 

So, let's talk about the benefits of being active.  When you're actively engaged in things, you're more likely to learn new things, make new friends, and just generally have a better time. Plus, it's good for your brain and body.  Like, did you know that doing stuff can actually help prevent dementia? 

But, you know, being idle is not good either.  Like, when you're just sitting around doing nothing, you're missing out on all these amazing opportunities. And it's not just boring, it's also bad for your health.  Like, it can lead to obesity and all sorts of other stuff. 

And then there's the whole thing about motivation and commitment in the workplace.  Like, it's super important to be motivated and committed to your job. Otherwise, you're just gonna be, like, the laziest person ever. 

But, you know, there are people who have totally improved themselves by being active. Like, did you know that Michael Jordan used to be a terrible basketball player?  But he practiced and practiced until he was the best.  And now he's like, a billionaire and stuff. 

And, um, being idle can have serious consequences too.  Like, if you're not doing anything with your life, you're gonna fall behind and stuff. And it's hard to catch up once you've fallen behind. 

So, yeah.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that people",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

63F12BD57AE7,"Have you ever come home from school and been bored, because you have nothing to do? Fortunately enough for you, there are tons of extracurricular activities available. I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first reason I believe this, is that students are able to try a new activity and meet new people. In addition to that, students can learn teamwork and make friends from an extracurricular. Finally, students participating in an extracurricular learn how to balance school work on on top of their activity.

When students try new activities, they can discover things about themselves and new people with common interests. Students may discover a talent or interest in something that they never knew they had. For example, if a person has never kicked a soccer ball, then they will not know whether they're good at it or they like it. Furthermore, even if students come to find that they don't like their extracurricular, they can still use this experience in the future. Just like when a person tries a new food, if that individual doesn't like it, then they will remember. The students can then use their knowledge to avoid what they don't like in the future. Last, it is beneficial to try a new activity, because you may meet someone you don't know who has similar interests to yours. Meeting these new people with common interests can lead to new friendships, that never would have happened. Trying a new extracurricular allows students to learn more about themselves and meet new people.

Participating in group activities is very important to students. For example, teamwork can be learned by practicing and working with a team in an extracurricular. In an extracurricular it is crucial that team members trust, rely, and work with each other to achieve the common goal. Secondly, using this teamwork to collaborate and accomplish goals, can lead to new friendships. When a student learns to trust and work with a team member within a extracurricular, they can also trust and collaborate with that person outside of the extracurricular. Last but not least, being able to work in a group is a very important skill that people look for when they are hiring for jobs. Companies look for teamwork in their employees, because co-workers need to be able to collaborate and respect each other to do their jobs efficiently. Activities that schools offer teach an important lesson about teamwork, that can create new friendships and be used outside of school.

Partaking in an extracurricular and school at the same time has many benefits. The first of those being, that participating in an activity and school at the same time teaches students the manage their time. Adding an extracurricular on top of schoolwork can only be done if the student learns to use all of their time wisely. This time management allows a person to do more things they love to do. If a person can be efficient and not procrastinate on things they have to do, they will have leftover time to do whatever they want. The final reason a student should attend school and do an extracurricular, is that time management is a necessary life skill that students must learn. In the future students may need to balance a family, work, and make time for themselves all at the same time. Participating in school and an extracurricular teaches students a valuable life lesson about time management, that can allow these students to do what they love.

I think that all students in school must partake in at least one extracurricular. I think this, because students can get new experiences and meet new people, while trying a new activity. Not only that, activities students participate in can teach teamwork that can lead to new friendships. My last reason for believing this is that, taking part in school and extracurricular activities gives students a lesson about how to manage time wisely. I believe that all schools should require students to partake in an extracurricular.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
33824B719879,"In today's society I think phones should be prohibited while operating a vehicle. Every year there are about 6 million car accidents dealing with teenagers between the ages 16 to 19 years old. We as people don't understand that when using a phone while driving they are taking their eyes off the road, people are more worried about their conversation which makes their concentration severely impacted, and it causes more accidents. In order to fix this problem, we as a unit need to break the habit of using phones while driving.

Due to people being on their phones its putting other people's lives at danger. When you're driving in your cellular device start going off that become a distraction. People are more urge to text back. In spite of the fact that picking up or taking a glance can increase you getting into an accident. Entitled to this problem people should put phones on Do Not Disturb or driving mode.

Their reaction time is slower. Resulting in the fact that they are on their phones. For an example, when you are on the highway in a song comes on that you don't like you take your eyes off the road to change it. This means the reaction time is affected by not being focused. Instead of changing it while driving wait until you come to a complete stop then change it.

So many car accidents happened in this day of age that people are being taken away from families. Many people lose loved ones or close friends, because of careless drivers. Most teens don't think about the causes that can affect others. Not to mention adults and teens don't think about their actions when putting other people live at matter. As a result, in making bad actions we as a whole need to think before driving recklessly.

Here are the given reasons to why phones should be prohibited while operating a vehicle. There are too many people losing their lives, reaction time is not as fast, and most of the accidents caused by ages between 16 to 19 years old. Parents should teach their children the do's and don'ts while driving, because there are a higher risks of their concentration being severely impact.              ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

Hey there,

For my career research project, I decided to look into the field of graphic design. I've always been interested in art and technology, and I think this career combines both of those things in a really cool way. Plus, I've seen some of the amazing things that graphic designers can create, like logos, posters, and websites, and I want to be able to do that too!

So, I started doing some research to see what skills and interests I have that align with this career. I found out that I'm pretty good at drawing and painting, and I'm also good at using computers and software to create digital art. I also like to think creatively and come up with new ideas, which is important for graphic design.

To learn more about the career, I talked to some people who are already in the field. They told me that graphic designers need to have a good eye for detail and a good sense of color and composition. They also need to be able to work well with clients and communicate their ideas effectively. I was surprised to learn that it's not just about being able to draw pretty pictures – it's also about being able to solve problems and come up with creative solutions.

Next, I made a list of the courses I can take to prepare for this career. I'm thinking of taking some art classes to improve my drawing and painting skills, as well as some computer classes to learn more about software and design principles. I'm also considering taking a course in graphic design specifically, to learn more about the industry and what's expected of graphic designers.

Overall, I think graphic design is a really cool career that combines my interests in art and technology. I'm excited to continue learning more about it and see where it takes me!

Why I Chose This Career:

I chose graphic design as my career because I'm interested in both art and technology, and I think this career combines both of those things in a really cool way.

Yes, there is many dangers on Venus, but there is so much to explore too; like how Venus is the most like Earth when it comes to shape and size, the gases and temperture, and the curious of how Venus looks like now.

When you think of Venus, what do you think of? Do you think of the heat or the size? Well, when scienetist think of Venus they ""[often] referred to as Earth's ""twin"", Venus is the cloese planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closet in distance too"". So, becasue of how close it looks in shape and size, you have to have though in your mind of, what else does it have in common.

When you think of dangerous gases and temperture, what this the things that you think of? Do you think of hot summer day or the gases in the air? Well, on Venus ""[a] thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuris acid in Venus's atmoshpere. In the planet's surface, tempertures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheris pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our own planet"". Eventhough, it could be life theathing, there are scientist that want to do test and collect gases and ect to do studies. They want to do studies because they want to learn some much more about Venus.

When you think of how Venus looks like, do you think of craters and the sign of no life? Well, you be somewhat correct because it has a rocky surface, and it looks like valleys, mountain and craters. Although ""[long] ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". Since, there was a possible that there was life forms and etc, scientist want to see if there was some kind of life living up there, but then got exstinted or somethings else happened to them.

D2DF0FA5218C,"Hey, I'm just an average 8th grader, so bear with me on this essay! 😅

Technology has totally transformed the way we interact with each other, and it's super cool! Like, I can video chat with my friends who live on the other side of the world, and we can play games together online. But, at the same time, it's kinda messed up how technology can make us feel lonely and disconnected from people around us. 🤔

On the positive side, technology has made it so much easier to stay in touch with people who are far away. My best friend moved to a different state last year, and we still talk every day on Facetime. It's like we're still hanging out even though we're not in the same room! And with all the social media platforms, it's easy to connect with new people and make new friends. 👫

But, on the other hand, technology can make us feel really isolated. Like, sometimes I'll be hanging out with my friends in real life, and we'll all be on our phones the whole time. It's like, what's the point of even being together if we're not really present? And sometimes I'll be chatting with someone online, and I'll forget that they're not actually there in front of me. It's like, my brain just assumes that they're right there with me, even though they're not. 🤯

So, which one outweighs the other? I think it really depends on how we use technology. If we use it in moderation and make sure to spend time with people in real life too, then it can be really beneficial. But if we get too caught up in our screens and forget about the people around us, then it can be really harmful. 💭

I found some evidence that supports both sides of the argument. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, teens who spend more time online are more likely to feel lonely and isolated. But, on the other hand, another study by the University of Michigan found that people who use technology to connect with others can actually feel more connected and less lonely.",1,llama2_chat,Task: Research and analyze the impact of technology on human contact and evaluate its effects on people's lives.

8414217a,"Abolishing the electoral college would be the best way to go for everyone. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. source 2, Plumer Some wonder, are the people in the electoral college even reliable? Many also believe that the electoral college is an unfair way of deciding whom the president will be. The electoral college is also flawed in a way that it makes the smaller states feel less important than the bigger states.

Are the people in the electoral college always reliable? Who even knows who chooses our electoral college? Voting citizens can't even control who the electoral college votes for sometimes, this is unjust and an outrage considering us citizens do the moral duty to vote and may not even get a fair outcome anyways. And, there are some cases in which voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. source 2, Plumer This ""winner takes all"" system is a big mess and highly unnecessary. Not to mention, it is also a very unfair way of deciding.

Some question if the electoral college is a fair way of voting. Which it is not. The electoral college can cause an unfair vote to the presidents which also upsets us citizens. What if say, 5,000 people vote in Florida, 3,000 for president 1, and 2,000 for president 2, and the electoral college sends it off as president 1 gets the vote for that college. But then, that 1,000 vote difference could have changed the vote for president country wide. A scenario like this may be unlikely, but it is possible. It has already happened once, it would be a shame if it did again. Chance of a situation like this draws a lot of people away from voting for president. Another unfair scenario was in 1976 when a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. Source 2, Plumer The electoral collage is bound to cause a catastrophe and we should stop it before it does.

The elctoral college is also unfair in a way that smaller states votes do not feel as important. Some people in the smaller states even say they haven't seen a campaign poster throughout an entire election because candidates feel as if campaigning isn't important in places that only have 3 or 4 electoral colleges. If we had a popular vote society, people in smaller states would feel like their vote is as important as those in the bigger states.

00203C45FC55,"It is every student's dream to be able to lounge around at home, and complete school from the comforts of their own beds. Though, for some students, this long desired fantasy is becoming a reality. With the introduction of new and innovative technologies into the classroom, distance learning is now a common practice, whether it be online or through video conferencing. However, to pretend that this is a solution to the ever-growing problems within the education system, is willfully ignorant. Distance education is actually detrimental to the students who choose to take these courses, due to the lack of typical classroom structure.

Everybody knows somebody like this in their lives; a homebody, someone who prefers staying home over going out, maybe doesn't have too many friends or has trouble forging bonds and building relationships. You may also call these people recluses, or shut-ins, but either way, you've stumbled across someone who fits this mold. Favorite characters even, like Oscar the Grouch or Angela from The Office, can be used as lovable examples. However, these traits are not always so endearing in a young child. Kids who display anti-social tendencies or simply wish to stay home and away from the hustle-and-bustle of the outside world would prefer distance learning undoubtedly. But, they would then forfeit the opportunity to build relationships with other kids of their own age. Especially with younger kids and kids who like to stay at home or be alone, learning and building social skills starts at school. If these children have the option to conduct their learning from home, they will miss out on important interactions with classmates, and also fall behind from a social development standpoint. And not knowing or understanding social cues or the proper way to communicate with someone, will prove a major hindrance to these kids in later years.

Another negative aspect of distance learning is the lack of discipline. Having a friend who is online-schooled, who admits frequently that he has ample free time, which he wastes on playing video games and watching TV, while at the same time, students in the classroom are made to do tedious book-work, is very eye-opening to a pressing issue. Students who take classes online have more time to slack off and goof around, and for the less-disciplined child, this will reflect negatively in their grades. However, some people will raise the point that there are distractions within in the classroom and students will slack off anyway, if they so desire. This is a valid observation. But without the constant droning of a teacher to be on task, kids who are distantly educated are more likely to become distracted and it's displayed in their meager and unsatisfactory work. Distractions don't cease to exist in a classroom setting, but they are heavily reduced compared to when a student is at home.

It's easily understandable that for some students, distance learning is simply the only viable option. Whether they physically cannot make it to the school building, or because their school merely doesn't offer the classes they wish to take, sometimes students are more or less forced to take online classes. And this is completely acceptable and understandable, and no one should fault these students for desiring an education and seeking out alternative options. However, these circumstances aren't always applicable to the students who choose distance learning. And those students, who have no other reason other than they ""just want to stay home"" or ""don't feel like it"", should have to sit in a classroom with the rest of their peers, and learn like in the same setting and environment that everyone else does. For lazy students, distance education is not a valuable resource, and abused in order to waste time.

Distance education will most likely always be a hotly debated topic, in which both sides of the argument will raise many deeply introspective and thought-provoking questions and points. In some cases, distance education is necessary and important. However, it cannot be ignored that distance learning is not conducive or beneficial to most students. The lack of a normal classroom set-up, with teachers and classmates replaced for a laptop and a of couple blankets, fails to help students develop vital social and communication skills, while simultaneously aiding in the slacking off and wasting time of many students.

COVID-19 is spreading across the world. Now this disease has killed more people than influenza has this year. Epidemiologists for the CDC are recommending that colleges across the country shut down their campuses and revert to online school so that they disperse the student population to lower the chances of the students getting infected. This suggestion has been readily accepted in colleges throughout the country. Soon public schools could follow the colleges' lead. More and more public schools are introducing a plethora of online classes. Many students are now able to do classwork and take assessments online as well as conference with their teachers from the comfort of their home. Students would benefit from online school through more direct, one on one learning with teachers, building each students aptitude with technology for their future participation in the workforce, and allowing students with a variety of ailments to continue their education at home.

First of all, with online classes students would be able to interact with their teachers on a more personal level. Currently, if a student needs help with homework or a concept that they are struggling with, most often, they will have to come and see their teacher before or after school. Some students simply do not have that availability to see their teacher or are too embarrassed to ask their teacher during the class session. With classes being taken online, the student could simply email the teacher privately to work out a time to video conference their teacher for help. This simple interaction with teachers would show that students could go to their teachers more easily and would feel more comfortable when asking questions. With this increase of inquiries, scores in the grade book could go up, increasing parental and student satisfaction. Due to the introduction of online education, teacher-student interaction would become easier and more common.

Second of all, Students would be able to become build their technological skills parallel to learning new material. Many employers in this hyper-technological world are looking for employees that will be able to keep up with new technologies as well as help their business grow. While students are at school, they have access to technology, but this access is limited and most often very basic for most people. If schools' education was offered online, many students would rapidly become accommodated with new and more complex programs and applications. Teachers could require logging of time spent studying on spreadsheets, or taking screen shots of research, as well as making projects on three-dimensional design software for every student that they have. So many things in the classroom would have to be transferred online, making students who graduate highly valued to any employer looking to hire somebody. Highschool students who become adept at using online applications would be beneficial for a student and future employers.

Third of all, any student that has to stay at home or be hospitalized due to a sickness would be able to continue their education. Throughout the year every school has a variety of issues, but one issue can truly devastate an education. If a student that is a tenth grader comes to school with what they think is a minor cold and goes about their entire day, many students would interact with this sophomore and soon all of these students would be home sick. Due to the transmission those classes would only have half the students it should have. This issue is morbidly obvious. However true this issue is, disease cannot spread through technology. Any students taking these online courses would be safe from any other students who are sick. This would allow schools' education to run with a little more grease on their axles. Due to students having an online education many students who become sick would not have to pause their education for any amount of time.

In order to address those opposed, it is understandable for anyone to do so, but not forgivable. Many would say that the students would lose their friends, that they might become awkward, and that students might even cheat on assessments. All of these are understandable, but they are not without solution. Schools would be getting rid of their on campus schooling but would still host extracurricular activities and sporting events, along with gym classes, as well as dances and pep rallies. This would help retain student friendships at school. Students cheating on assessments has been a problematic in all school systems for years, writing on your arms and hands, looking at a friend's paper to see which bubbles they filled in, or even feverishly copying someone's homework in the hallways outside of a class. While online learning may be a good fix for a lot of these issues it could open up new problems as well. Students could use their phones to search for answers to a variety of tests or share their answers with friends via text message. Their is no end to the creativity of someone who wants to cheat on an assignment, that is why a student's parent could supervise the student on each test and let the teacher know that the student was honest. This would be an easy way of reassurance for all instructors.

In conclusion, online school for students could be greatly beneficial. Through one on one interaction with teachers, spurring more inquiries from pupils, becoming more proficient with technology at school and in the workplace, and allowing students who are afflicted with disease, and sometimes an injury, to attend school. Online school would benefit many students in this modern world. Now do what you think is right, go to a school board meeting, or sign a petition, because once we make this change, the Virginian education system will be stronger than any other state's.

I believe that you should allow students to be able to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free times. Yes you should allow the students to bring their cell phones and use them during free times because during free time students just talk and hangout. Some times talking in person is a bad thing, there for not talking face to face is a good thing. For example say I was mad at someone and if I would talk to them in person things would of gone bad, but if we used technology then things would be good again and would have not gone down a bad path. Cell phones are a good use of technology for everything and everyone should be allowed to use them. Yes if we students could be allow to use our cell phones on our free time and have them turned off during class, that would be fantastic! Students would be able to talk, record videos, take pictures and be able to remember everything and have great memories. Remembering memories is a good thing because we can look back and laugh, cry, and learn from our mistakes. Students are happy that we have technology yet most of the time we are not allow to use it. Technology helps everyone and everything become better. Cell phones help us communicate to people when we need help or just to talk have and have a good time. That's why I think you should allow students to use their technology during school on their free time. Rather than keep the No Cell phones Allowed rule. I hope you understand and agree with me and change the no cell phone rule to cell phones allowed.

I think that kids should be required to do community service and I also think that it depends on what the parents say.

I agree that kids should have to do community service because it builds character what I mean by that is that being a in these times I know that we are lazier than what kids used to be. A lot of kids just text and are on facebook all day and some don't even do their homework. If kids were to do community service it would give them a good working habit and would help kids survive in the future of this bad economy.

In the past people helped each other get things done and it wasn't uncommon to see a child walking an old lady across the street. Now kids try to push people out of the way so they can get across the street. That's another thing that community service will help with is kids learning how to be courteous to their elders and also their piers. some kids don't know ow to act in public and be respectful but once community service starts to become a regular thing they will be. It will also help communities grow with each other so that everybody will start to get to know each other and work together.

I think a good addition to this system would be some type of reward system that would give kids motivation to actually do the community service and if they don't do it there should be a punishment like lunch detention or something of that sort. I think that what required community service would also help with is self discipline. It will teach kids how to get things done and done the right way and that will also factor in with school and how kids do on homework or projects and even studying for test which will really prepare them for highschool and college

Well I hope you go along with the community service idea because I think that its really going to help kids a lot.

If the curfew adopt the teenagers, the situation will change to the better. the council said the teenagers don't have to be in the street after 10 p. m. in the weekdays because they want the teenagers out of troubles. and they found teenagers in the street after 10 P.M. that's mean is breaking the law. that warning for the people because sometimes the bad people walk around have a knife or have a gun these people can kill someone kidnapping anyone. Or someone make a bomb and try to put it in street. and also is danger because maybe someone drank a lot and he drove the car maybe can hit anybody by the car that's why the police check the city a lot of time to make sure no bad things will happen and also the police check the city because if someone have something wrong they will help them. if the teenagers don't break the law this will help the police to try make the city safe the safety in city is so important. Like example that happen with me when I was 15 years old I was walking in the street at 11 p. m. and I was going to my home I see one man behind me but I thought is regular man but he was have a knife and he said to me give anything you have I was have my wallet had on it my ID and not too much money and I don't have anyone in the street to help me and he took my phone and he told me leave and don't look behind you I ran away because he was almost gonna kill me. be in your home early to be safe. The police doesn't want to control on you but he want to be safely. because the world is not safe now the world have a lot of bad people. And also I was have my friend was in street at 1 a. m. and someone was drank and hit my friend by the car. And my friend is dead all of these to show you how the world is not safe. the police have a lot of situations with the bad people. and if you look at the countries is not safe the reason is because every day around the country you will find everyday someone killed. That's tells you how the world is not safe. a lot of people dead because of the people is drank or the someone have a gun or knife. if you search in internet about the people is succeed in their life the internet will show you these people focused in their future when they finish their work the going to their home to take a rest. try to make your schedule early like in the mid day in the morning to go to your home early.

PEOPLE

are not voting for who should be president,its the electors that are electing the new or next president. This is so flawed needs to be changed like now.

The collage electoral process does have its benefits like if a president candidate increased his popularity in states he knew he could win popularity in, That would gain no electoral votes. The winner take all method sounds like a great idea.

But think about the children may think its a bad idea and I agree with them as well. Why? you may ask, well lets think about it kids dont want to be at school for a very much more time in what they are already in for. Many students go to after school activities at certain times and get out later others dont but do some outside of school activities like sports, helping the community, getting chores done, {etc.}. You may seem like those arent important but for the students do think its important and also school, but the home work time they have left to do at home my not be a good idea on the different after school programs they may be in at different times when it starts and when it end times go fast and may not be time to go over homework or study for a test the next day. Education are good for the kids but getting low grades may not help them in the future and for the family. Many students wont have anytime to be spending with their family together any more with those times being spent on school and sports and other activities.

Families may think its a bad idea too add more hours to school and to take away time after school to get things done and to have time to enjoy with families at outside places at an restaurant or to go out for walks before bed times and the next day. While other parents my think if there going to add more time to school then students should arrive to school at least 20 minutes later for kids to have more time to sleep for an long school day, so they wouldnt be sleepy in the mornings. As may I think that over the week ends families like to go to far places and if students end up having projects and home work to do could effect the time with family and school and that wouldnt be so good for the students. Think about it kids not doing well in homework and test for not studying for not have any time after school for the extra hour and thirty minutes they are going to get that wont be good for the school county and less students would start coming to there schools and rather transfer to a better school with less hours or just consider home school and your school would have kids leaving and wont be able to have students to teach anymore.

Why not put something like this that can read out faces inside school. Traspass their privacy. Even so, during school it would not come in handy with any student anytime during the day. Being watched by a face recongnition in the home of many, is an event many would not agree with.

During the school year, for example, a high school. Where would a Facial Action Coding System fit into? This would not benifit our education other than waste it. The new technology being used on students to detect their emotions is a privacy violation. Students would not want their face being read and pictured by a new face detection. For example, in the story it says, ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" With this being said, this technology invades our space. Some students don't want their emotions being let out; they might want it to keep that private information to themselves, unless they realease it by themselves. This could happen to anyone, even without them realizing it. For example, sitting in the right position across from the Facial Action Coding System, the victims emotion may be violated without their concent.

C9BA274FDEBC,"Dear principle,

I think that more kids should help out the community every once in awhile. But what i also think that kids should have the freedom to choose what they want to do in their free time. If they feel that they should help out the community then they can. But others do not have the time or they might just have other things they might rather to do.

Since community service helps the environment and helps keep the town clean, i think you should maybe start a club where they can do these kind of things. If they so desire to join the club they will have the free will to choose. Some of the kids might think that it is a waste of there time. Well, add something interesting to the club that will grab other kids attention. Like for example have fun activities that is community work, but is fun for the kids to do. If their was a club that did community service, i wouldn't join, but if the club wasn't all revolved around community work and had other activities to do, i think i might be more willing to join.

Don't make the club all about community service. Have little activities that the kids will enjoy doing. Like making art out of things from the out doors or maybe have camping at a park. Something that will sound interesting enough for the kids to enjoy.

They key point is that some people thing community work isn't for them because it doesn't sound appealing. If you take away their freedom to do what they want they could get upset for that. But when you give them the freedom to chose some might be willing to join the club. I think that a community club is a good thing to do and so might others.

8DCC1AC9A8EA,"In today's world, success is a term that is often associated with wealth and material possessions. However, true success is not just about having money, but also about finding oneself and achieving personal fulfillment. In this essay, I will explore how people try to be successful in their lives despite the influence of their environment, and compare being successful with money and being successful based on personal desire.

Firstly, let's consider the influence of the environment on success. Growing up, we are surrounded by various factors that can either help or hinder our progress. For example, a supportive family can provide a strong foundation for success, while a lack of guidance or negative influences can lead to failure. Additionally, our environment can influence our opportunities and resources, which can either help or hinder our ability to achieve our goals.

Despite these challenges, people continue to strive for success in their lives. Some may see success as a means to an end, such as achieving financial stability or achieving a certain level of status or recognition. However, true success is not just about external achievements, but also about finding inner peace and fulfillment. This is where personal desire comes into play.

When we set goals and work towards them, we often do so based on our own personal desires and motivations. Whether it's pursuing a passion or striving to overcome a challenge, our goals are driven by our own inner drive. This is what ultimately leads to true success, as we are able to achieve our goals in a way that brings us personal satisfaction and fulfillment.

On the other hand, success based on money can be fleeting and ultimately unsatisfying. While having financial stability can provide a sense of security and freedom, it does not necessarily lead to personal fulfillment. In fact, many people who have achieved great financial success have found that it was not the key to happiness.

In conclusion, being successful in life is not just about external factors such as wealth or status. True success is about finding oneself and achieving personal fulfillment. While the environment can provide both opportunities and challenges, it is ultimately our own personal desires and motivations that drive us towards true success. By focusing on our own inner drive, we can achieve our goals in a way that brings us personal satisfaction and fulfillment.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,7
394E5EF1B5AC,"98.7% of people don't want to participate in school activities because in their minds, a little voice is telling them, ""Why do school activities when there is no point in them?"" Shut that voice off and think about if school activities would actually help you in school. I strongly agree about students participating in at least one hobby because you can be helping your school out and the other people around you. Participating in a school activity can help you get a more healthier mind, raise money for your school, and help you with teamwork skills.

First of all, having a clean mind makes your body feel healthy and energized. It can make you feel less overwhelmed and help you think about other important things. School activities can help a lot with dreadful and depressed times, that is why it is a great idea to participate and have a cleaner mind. It can help with a lot of your problems and can take your mind off of a lot of things.

Therefore, participating for your school can help them raise money. The money they raise can help families in need for shelter, clothes, food, or anything they need to survive. The money can also go to book stores, clothes stores, shoes stores, toy stores, and anything families would be thrilled to have. It can put a smile on your face helping the families in need.

Lastly, partnership is a great way to fit in, it can help you make lots of new friends and explore the meaning of true teamwork. Teamwork is a good way of being respectful, for an example, if your having trouble on a sport or different hobby, someone could step in and lend you a helping hand. Working together on sports, projects, and different types of hobbies, can make a lot of things easier for you. Making new friends helps you have a fun time and makes your life a lot better.

In conclusion, having a cleaner mind, helping families in need, and having partnership skills are all great ways why you should participate in school activities. It can make you feel amazing inside when you help other people around you. Helping out your school can actually be a good feeling, it gives you a positive mind set and can help you for your future. Before telling yourself "" There is no point in school activities,"" think about how it can help you, families, friends and your school.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
d7c32a34,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have various advantages for both individuals and the environment. This trend is being adopted in many places around the world as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote more sustainable living. The passages provided highlight the benefits of limiting car usage in various locations, such as Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; and Bogota, Colombia. These examples show how car-free communities and initiatives can lead to a better quality of life and a healthier environment.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to global warming and air pollution. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some US car-intensive areas, this number can go up to 50%. By limiting car usage, these emissions can be drastically reduced, helping to mitigate climate change and improve air quality.

In Vauban, Germany, a car-free community has been established where only two places for car parking are allowed. As a result, 70% of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57% sold their cars to move there. Residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed without the constant need for a car. This shows that limiting car usage can lead to a better quality of life by promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit.

Paris, France, recently enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air due to intense smog. This measure resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and improved air quality. Although some delivery companies complained of lost revenue, exceptions were made for electric and hybrid vehicles, promoting the use of more eco-friendly transportation options. By limiting car usage, cities can combat pollution and create a healthier environment for their residents.

Car-free days have also been implemented in Bogota, Colombia, as a means of reducing smog and promoting alternative transportation. The success of these days has led to an expansion of the program to other cities in the country. The goal is to reduce traffic congestion and pollution, encouraging people to use buses, bikes, or walk to work instead. This initiative has seen positive results, with millions of Colombians participating and experiencing the benefits of car-free transportation.

In summary, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages. It can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create a healthier and more sustainable environment. Additionally, it can enhance quality of life by promoting alternative modes of transportation and reducing stress associated with car ownership. Initiatives like car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage and provide a blueprint for more sustainable living. As these examples show, this trend is gaining momentum around the world, and its benefits are becoming increasingly recognized.",1,radek_500,,1
D14413B502FD,"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! Here's my essay on the topic of how hard work and constant effort can help individuals achieve their goals.

I think we've all heard the saying ""Practice makes perfect,"" but have you ever stopped to think about how true that really is? I mean, think about it – if you're trying to get better at something, whether it's playing a sport, learning a new skill, or even just trying to be a better person, you're gonna have to put in the work to make it happen.

One of the best examples of this is inventors. Like, think about it – most of the time, the people who come up with the coolest, most game-changing inventions are the ones who have been working on them for years and years. They don't just sit around twiddling their thumbs, waiting for inspiration to strike – they put in the time and effort to make their dreams a reality.

And it's not just inventors – anyone can benefit from putting in the work. Like, if you want to get better at a sport, you're gonna have to practice regularly. If you want to get better at playing the guitar, you're gonna have to practice for hours every day. It's not gonna come easily, but if you keep at it, you'll see improvement.

But here's the thing – inactivity can also serve a purpose. Sometimes, taking a break and stepping back from something can actually help you come back to it with a fresh perspective and a newfound passion. Like, if you're working on a project and you're feeling stuck, taking a day or two off to relax and recharge can actually help you come back to it with renewed energy and creativity.

And it's not just individuals – companies can benefit from constant effort too. Like, think about it – the companies that are always striving to improve their products and services are the ones that are gonna be the most successful. They're not just sitting around doing the same old thing – they're always pushing themselves to be better, to innovate, and to stay ahead of the game.

falcon_180b_v1_859,"(I do not have a personal position, but can present both arguments for and against vegetarian or vegan diets.)

in recent years, there has been a growing movement advocating for the reduction of meat consumption due to environmental and health concerns. many individuals argue that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is the way to go. while there are valid points on both sides of the argument, i believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet would be a wise choice for many reasons.

the first reason for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is the positive impact it would have on the environment. the production of meat has been shown to require much more water, land, and energy than producing plant-based food. in fact, it takes approximately 20 times more energy to produce 1 kilogram of beef compared to 1 kilogram of vegetables. by reducing our meat consumption, we can help reduce our carbon footprint and slow down the effects of climate change.

the second reason to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet is for health purposes. studies have shown that plant-based diets are associated with lower rates of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. additionally, a vegetarian or vegan diet is often higher in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which are essential for maintaining good health.

however, some people argue against the adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet, citing that meat is an important source of protein, and that it can be challenging to get all the necessary nutrients on a plant-based diet. while it is true that meat is a good source of protein, it is possible to achieve adequate protein intake on a vegetarian or vegan diet by consuming protein-rich plant-based foods, such as beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds. it is also important to note that a well-planned vegetarian or vegan diet can provide all the necessary nutrients for good health.

Being able to do class work at home, will benefit the students that live far from the school; they attend and make it easier for them to get the education they still need. Distance learning will also help the students manage there time better. Because of the fact the students don't have to go and spend time at the actual school. The travel time it takes the students to go and come back from school would not be a factor anymore if they attend online classes in there house.

A reason distance learning could benefit students is that it could improve student attendance. If you were sick and could not go to school you can work on the things you will miss at school. Another thing is that for the students that struggle with transportation to get to school on certain days; instead they can finish the school work at home which would be easier instead of stressing over how they are going to get to school. The way it would benefit students is that it will help them focus more on work than instead of focusing on transportation to school.

This could also benefit on the days that school gets canceled. For example school gets canceled because of a snow day or some other reason. Something that is really big on news right now is the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The U.S. is deciding to close schools in certain states around the country. Distance learning could benefit by if some schools were to actually close, it would not affect student education as much as it would if there was not a way to learn at home. If there was a snow day and some parents did not want there kids to walk to school on the sidewalk because it was dangerous; and they could drive them either because of the fact they had to go to work. A easier and safer way would be just to have them do the school tasks in there house. In the past when it rained or snowed really hard and the next day I had to go to school sometimes the roads would be flooded or their would have been an acident that prevent me from getting to school. In those cases it would be nice to have the option to learn from home instead of going through the trouble to figure out a way on how to get to school.

In some cases it is better for the students to work at school than it is at home. A reason being is at school they can meet new friends and be in a better working and studying envoirment. Another thing would be that their are less things that could distract you from completing work. For example when you are at home you have all your computers, phone, TV, and things like a Xbox that could get you distracted or off topic. When you are at school their are friends that can distract you to but when you are in class it is hard to do anything else besides work. The reason is that your teacher won't let you go on your phone or talk to your friends as much before you finish with your in class assignment. A Benefit from going to school is that a lot of the things that you learn come from talking or hearing it from people at school. So if you attend classes at home instead of going to school it impacts some things that you could actually learn from going to school. A lot of the things I have learned in my past is from talking or asking a friend how to complete an assignment, if you are at home and have nobody to talk to it is not as beneficial as it is going to school.

The fact being that their are benefits from learning at home and learning at school. Because when you are at home you can get distracted easier cause their is no teacher that is watching over you to complete your assignments. But when you are at school you are surrounded by other kids that could talk to you and disturb you on doing your work. Their are pros and cons in both situations but having the option to attend classes at home is better than not having the ability to. Because of that I think that distance learning is better in most cases cause it gives you more options in how you can complete work.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

The concept of online schooling is very simple work at home ask questions later. It is something we agree with because it is really only beneficial to those who dont have the resources or tools anyway. It presents itself with being very universal and outgoing and comfortable because who wouldnt wanna learn new things in the comfort of their own home. However, It is a factor that revolves around endless distractions, little too none human interaction ,and very little visual an guided learning.

Being a teen parent doing online courses sounds so day filling and convenient but being a regular student very average with distractions and new task every where you go. For students distraction is always near and it is hard too not get distracted. Lets say your family just flew in its a week before the holiday an you want too do what they are doing like go to the movies or wrestle or play on your new Xbox. School work or online courses would not be on your mind which would cause more people to fall behind in there courses. Distractions are a factor in anything presented too you For example, your teacher hands u a piece of paper and says write your name while they are talking you might lean over and talk too the person next too you about the paper or get on your phone and miss the instructions that were given.

Human interaction is some what needed to preform any task although, If you are anything like me then you like too be shown how too do everything given and you will need an explanation after every thing that they are showing you .Human interaction is the quickest reply you will ever get and man to man and skin too skin contact is a way too keep from becoming antisocial . Working at home might cause you too feel like you dont need anyone too help you an you might just wanna be alone all the time . Most of the time people will develop early on issues because they feel that the help they needed was not provided during this stage or process. I know some of you are probably thinking that they have parents why cant they just help them however, not everyone is provided with that option what if there parents did not graduate or what if they did not further their education. This why public schooling or private schooling should be put into action and thought about

Online courses are not specified too those that need visuals and need too visualize before completing an action. Visual learning also goes with human interaction it is something that helps us succeed in the real world. In the real world in order too ask questions or in order to get a job you have too complete a face too face interview. The world is starting too become more and more lenient on the concept and the uses of technology. But, No one is going too hire someone with un-professional attire too become there lawyer its not really acceptable in the place of business due too the views ,perceptions and, standards of the world. The way you dress or look in your home is different then when you leave your home they will not learn these real world skills because they werent taught and didnt develop those characteristics like everyone else.

In conclusion, Online schooling or online courses are only truly beneficial too those that need it and those that are doing it due to circumstance and it should not be encouraged amoungst those that do not have a great amount of self control and self reliance. Without those skills and without interpersonal skills they will not succeed and they will not learn daily life skills. it seems very simple but it is not and should not be treated as such. ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

857574FE9711," In my opinion, Emerson's statement that everyone can do anything, but not everyone wants to work hard to achieve it, is still true today. While it may seem like anything is possible with effort, it's important to remember that not everything comes easily.

For example, in my personal life, I have always dreamed of owning my own helicopter. While it may seem like an impossible dream, I believe that with hard work and dedication, it's achievable. However, I also recognize that it won't come without some level of effort.

One of the things that I have learned is that nothing comes easy. Everything has a price, and in order to achieve my goals, I must be willing to put in the work. While it may be difficult at times, I believe that it's worth it in the end.

I also believe that it's important to never give up on your dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem. Even if I can't see my dream in the present, I still believe that it's already mastered. This means that I will continue to work hard towards achieving my goals, even if it means that it takes time.

Ultimately, I believe that the key to success is to have a strong belief in yourself and your abilities. This means having good health and a supportive family, as well as the willingness to take risks and try new things. By doing so, I believe that I can achieve anything that I set my mind to, no matter how difficult it may seem.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

In his famous letter to John Adams, he wrote, ""I am convinced that there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor."" Jefferson believed that laughter and good humor were essential to the progress of society, and that they could only be achieved through constant work and motion.

Jefferson's perspective on the importance of constant work and motion can be seen in his own life. He was a prolific writer, inventor, and architect, and he was constantly working on new projects and ideas. He believed that the only way to achieve success and progress was through constant work and motion, and he set an example for others to follow.

In today's world, Jefferson's perspective on the importance of constant work and motion is still relevant. Many people believe that success and progress can only be achieved through hard work and dedication. For example, many successful entrepreneurs and business leaders have worked tirelessly to achieve their goals, and they have credited their success to their constant work and motion.

However, Jefferson's perspective on the importance of constant work and motion is not without its critics. Some people argue that it can lead to burnout and exhaustion, and that it is not always necessary for progress. For example, some artists and creatives have achieved great success by taking breaks and allowing themselves time to rest and recharge.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson's perspective on the importance of constant work and motion is still relevant in today's world. While it is not without its critics, many people believe that it is essential to achieving success and progress.

CA73BDEC2752,"Moral values and social classes play an integral role in the formation of a person's character. As an individual's life progresses, these characteristics take on different meanings and meanings, ultimately contributing to personal growth, identity, and decisions. 

Morals are the values that we have developed throughout our lives and that guide us in decision making. They shape our conscience and give us direction in moments of doubt or struggle. In addition, they inform us of our beliefs, attitudes, and preferences. For example, a moral principle such as not stealing can discourage a person from taking shortcuts or engaging in other criminal activities. In essence, morals are the compass of our lives which leads us in making good character decisions.

Class also plays a role in how a person's character is formed. People from different social classes may have different sets of morals and values due to their different upbringings and backgrounds. For example, someone who grew up in a wealthy family may have a different view of debating than someone who was raised in a low-income household. How one perceives these different codes of conduct dictates one’s character.

Finally, the people that a person surrounds themselves with have a significant influence on their character. People who are surrounded by positive and strong influences in their lives tend to have higher self-esteem and are less susceptible to acting prematurely or rashly. Moreover, they learn from the example of the people around them and can learn how to handle different situations and what to expect when in different scenarios.

In conclusion, morals, social class, and people are all key contributors to the formation of a person's character. Everyone has different values and experiences that shape the person they become, and it is important to take the time to recognize how these elements create who we are.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Write an essay discussing the role of morals, social class, and people in building character.",8
CFBCF638F69D,"Summer is the time of the year most people enjoy. Students usually enjoy this time the most. However, there is one thing that can completely ruin it. Summer projects, something most kids would cry if they heard they had to do them. Most students show hatred towards them because it takes away from their favorite time of the year, summer! Most students forget or just chose not to complete them. Summer projects were created to keep students learning during long breaks. Teacher's usually assign these students topics. However, I believe if you give students the responsibility of choosing their own projects they would strive to complete them and mature mentally as young adults should. Student-designed projects see more completion, interest, and improvement than the average assignment. I, as a student, would want control over my project. I typically do not do as well with teacher topics as well as some of my other fellow students.

When teachers design their summer projects they use topics that fit into the lesson plan or that interest them personally. This is not fair to the student. If a student received a topic that they hated they would, more than likely, fail that project. There are a lot students who would toughen up and do the project, but most students are not like that. They will put in minimal effort towards the project just enough to pass if that. This effects grades and does not show a students true ability to perform outside the learning environment.

Humans grow in controlled situations. We as the students should be given that opportunity to grow by controlling our project. If students chose their own topics there would show a lot more effort in completion of the project. This improves the want to learn, has a better effect on grades, and learning mentality improves tremendously. Students would take more time for better results and show select skills taught by teachers, which is what teachers want to see.

I believe student-designed is the way to go. Giving us the power also gives us motivation to do it. I strive when I can do research on things I like or have a slight interest in. It is a completely different experience when you can learn about what you want to versus being in a classroom forced to learn about boring topics. For example, the American Revolution or chemical equations. By giving us topics were at an automatic disadvantage with a 32% higher chance of failure.

In other words, students have better performance with self-liked topics. Teacher-designs typically get less attention and a lot more failures from students. Finally, if you want better results from your students give them a little power every now and then. We strive in those situations made by ourselves contrasted to the ones picked out for us.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
399134D6E1E8,"The Electoral College is a system where elected senators from each state vote for the next president of the United States Of America. But doesn't voting belong to the hands of the citizens? Citizens of the U.S should pick their president without the hand of the state senators that would vote for the other canidate. The state of Wyoming representing 500000 voters have as much say as the senators from California with 35 million people and more. The Electoral College is a flawed sytem in which the senators not the people choose their next president.

The Electoral College should have less say in the next presidency because of the ""Winner take all"" system in which candidates don't spend time in areas they know have no chance at getting their votes. These canidates would only then go for the Swing states and not even try to get the votes of the other states. Leaving the fate of the next president in the hand of a few is not a reasonable act. Although few citizens of America know the complex working of the government and need the knowledge of the senators to get the right vote. The goverment should know that giving the right to vote to only a few people is not a good solution to the problem. The problem lies where the senators not the people vote for their next prisent.

The prime example of a canidant that won the popular vote but loss on the Electoral vote was Al Gore. George W. Bush won the election with only 5 Electoral while Gore won the peoples votes. Only 5 people were able to change the presidental election, this is exacly why people should be the one to vote for their presidents not the other way around. This flawed system brings out the question that ""are we really voting for the president or our senators?"" it is the latter. The peoples votes aren't for the president but really is for the senators that then vote for the president. But the senators would then only vote for the president that would only for for the mijority of the people not the minority.

Electoral College should be replaced with a popular vote system that allows for more equal voting amoung the people instead of a few. The Electoral College should be instead a advice System giving people an idea of who to choose and tell the people what the president is looking for and what to do. With this new system presidents would actually go for the states that they knew wouldn't have voted for them before and at least try to get a few votes out of the smalle places that would vote for them.

CE28B6B31CCE,"If we dont make a change now we, could be in a lot of trouble twenty years from now. Us as people dont really ever look at how much we actually are hurting the world and ourselves. For instance, limiting your car usage. That right there saves money for you and also helps keep our enviroiment clean and healthy.

First of all, if you were to limit your car use from seven days a week to maybe three, you would be saving a ton of money. The avarage person probably fills there gas tank all the way up once a week. Depending on mile per gallon your car ges it could be different, but if you were to only use your car three days out of the week you would only have to fill your tank up about every two weeks instead of every weeks. You would save so much money if you were to do that. Gas prices arnt cheap in todays world, its not like you can go get a gallon of gas for 50 cents anymore.

Second of all, used gas contaminates our world almost more than anything. The feums that come out of cars/trucks is the reason why we are having the types of problems that we are having enviromental wise. In source 1: In German suburb, life goes on without cars, the people who live in Vauban Germany only get to use there car everyother day depending on licsence plate numbers.

I want you to think about community service and why you want all of the students to participate.

I can see your point of view and how we should all help out and do our share to help the environment.

But what about the students that don't have time to help out.

Like the students that are having trouble at school and they need to focus on their grades so they can get a good education.

Or the kids who's parents are in the hospital and the kids is taking care of the parent and they don't have the time to even worry about themselves.

Personally I can understand why you want everyone to help but you don't need to force us to do this.

Everyone helps out every day even if they don't know it.

Like a girl I know who babysits her neighbors kids every once and a while or even a kid picking up a piece of trash in the school cafeteria.

You might not notice it but we students do a lot of community service.

Actually this Thursday the school is helping out by having a bake sale for a girl who died of cancer and they're raising money for awareness .

Some kids are spending time tonight to bake cupcakes, cookies and other sweets for the bake sale.

While others are staying after school to help sell when they could have been at home on the computer or working on homework.

See we help out on our own when we have time, but if you make all of us participate then we won't be happy and then helping the community will become more like a hassle than something we sacrificed our time for.

I hope you truly understand our point of view and I hope you will give us an option on whether we should help the community, because we all help out in our own little ways.

Cell phones distracts the driver from the road. It could cause an accident and potentially kill you. Texting and driving is also illegal in almost every state.

Being on a cell phone while driving distracts you. You can lose focus on the road and swerve into a different lane and cause an accident. Being distracted can cause you to miss a turn you were supposed to make. A car in front of you can make a sudden stop and if you're on your phone you wouldn't have a quick reaction.

Being on a cell phone while driving could have you in a very bad accident and you could potentially die. Continuously looking down at the phone and the road is difficult. The roads are not a straight path and looking at the phone you wouldn't be able to realize that your driving a slight curve and you swerve into another lane, then you look up and see that your in two lanes you try to swerve back into your lane and a car was coming up on the side of you and now your in an accident.

Yes it is weird that this landform looks like a face i agree with that, but saying aliens made it is just crazy. Here are some reasons on how i know and can prove that aliens did not make this.

First if aliens did make this how could they make it. They had to have some kind of machine or something they couldn't have just built it with there hands. So if they did make it we would of seen how like some machine like i said before. Also they would of left some kind of foot mark or something they couldn't have and not left a single mark.

The second reason is if aliens made it don't you find it weird that it looks like a human face. Where or how would they get the idea of making it look like our faces. The only way they could do that is if they went to earth and saw our faces there and if there aliens on earth NASA would be the first to know.

The third reason is in unmasking the face on mars it says in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform common around the American West."" Then to prove it even more it says this. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an islolated mesa about the SAME height as the face in mar."" So that just said that these ""faces"" are common around the American West and I'm pretty sure aliens are not on earth. So unless aliens came to earth made a face and then left without NASA seeing it would be impossible.

These are my 3 reasons on why i think it is impossible that aliens made it. It's just a natural form. I am not saying aliens are not real but i am saying that they did not make this face without us seeing it.              ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

840619A0CF0B,"As an eighth-grade student, I often find myself wondering whether it is more beneficial to be always doing something or if taking breaks and engaging in inactivity serves a purpose. I believe that Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, had a similar view on this matter. In his letter to John Adams, Jefferson wrote, ""I am a firm believer in the necessity of retirement, and of recreation, and of solitude, and of repose."" This quote suggests that Jefferson believed that taking breaks and engaging in inactivity was important for personal growth and well-being.

While it is true that being always doing something can lead to productivity, it can also lead to burnout and exhaustion. When we are constantly working, we may become so focused on our tasks that we neglect our own needs and well-being. This can lead to physical and mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety, and depression. On the other hand, engaging in inactivity can provide us with a much-needed break from our daily routines and give us time to recharge and refresh our minds.

One of the consequences of inactivity is that it can lead to a lack of motivation. When we are not engaged in any activities, we may feel unfulfilled and unproductive. This can lead to a lack of drive to accomplish anything, which can be detrimental to our personal growth and development. However, there are strategies that we can use to motivate ourselves to engage in productive activities.

One strategy is to set goals for ourselves. By setting specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals, we can give ourselves a sense of purpose and direction. This can help us to stay motivated and focused on our tasks. Additionally, we can break our goals down into smaller, more manageable tasks, which can help us to feel more accomplished and motivated.

Another strategy is to choose our activities wisely. It is important to distinguish between idle activities and productive activities. Idle activities, such as watching TV or scrolling through social media, may provide temporary distraction, but they do not contribute to personal growth or development. On the other hand, productive activities, such as reading, writing, or exercising, can help us to achieve our goals and improve our overall well-being.

C9EF98006357,"With some thought I really like the idea of ths FACS. Not only can it train us to know someones emotions but it can make lessons at school more intersting. If I am reading an essay about something that I do not like, obviously I will not attain as much knowledge as I should. The computer that reads my facial expressions and designs a whole new lesson per say, is the one I want.

I can see this program coming in play for a lot of applications. We could get more kids to enjoy school.

In the first parapgraph the author talks about how this program can read and understand someones emotions. They used a painting that dates back centries ago, and still can see exactly the emotion of Mona Lisa. If this program can do this to a painting, imagine what it could do in the daily life of most people! Just think about how much of us use technology. We dont always see what we want to see on social media and what not when it comes to adds. This program can read how you feel about that add and change the add the next time. Thats amazing.

In paragraph 3 the author explains kinda how it works. The only problem I could see come about is security. I mean i wouldnt want some program judging my facial expressions 24/7. So there would have to be some type of agreement and some rules. Also I would want what the programs reads about my emotions to only be shared with me and not be accsessed by others. Its a personal thing.

I was wondering about how the program could read mixed or multiple emotions. Paragraph four goes into detail about this. The author writes ""by weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" and "" Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" So I would think this software is decently accurate.

Every day at school us students are forced to read and comprehend stuff that we have no say in. It has always been like that. To me I would think if a student is enjoying what He or She is learning they will learn and attain more knowledge. That is where this software comes in. Looking around at fellow classmates, I could almost guarentee that I will not find anyone smiling. Well maybe I could but I can promise you they are not doing school work.

So again I am for sure all for this software. When you stop and think about all the applications this could be used for, it is amazing. Not only that but look at how this could change education. This software can help truly tell someone how they are conveying themselves in public. You may think you look and seem hapy, when to everyone else you look like a sad puppy. Again this is a great software and would do some great things for a lot of people.       ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
D2DF0FA5218C,"The advent of technology has greatly changed our lives, both positively and negatively, when it comes to contact between people. On the one hand, technology has enabled us to connect with people more quickly and efficiently than ever before. We can call, text, and video chat with people virtually anywhere in the world, without ever having to leave our homes. We can also network and collaborate with people online, allowing us to form meaningful relationships from thousands of miles away. On the other hand, the convenience of technology has led to a decline in face-to-face contact. With the rise of social media, it's become even easier to stay in touch, but actual physical contact is becoming less common. 

Despite its many benefits, technology can also lead to isolation and loneliness if it is overused. People can spend hours glued to their phones and computers, never leaving the house and rarely interacting with anyone in person. This can lead to increased feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety. 

In conclusion, while technology has had a positive effect on human contact by making connectivity between people much easier, its overuse can also lead to negative effects on people's lives. When used in moderation, technology can be a valuable tool, but when taken to extremes, it can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection. The potential for negative effects outweighs the positive ones, so it is important to make sure to use technology in a balanced and responsible manner.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Research and analyze the impact of technology on human contact and evaluate its effects on people's lives.

For me joining the program was a great opportunity.

You were never bored, caring for the animals during the crossing kept me busy and on return trips we played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

Besides helping people, I had the side benifet of seeing Europe and China.

CEFC32741811," Self-reliance, as defined by those who embrace it, means relying on one's own instincts and ideas. I believe that seeking guidance from experts can improve decision-making, as most people look to others for advice when making important decisions.

I remember asking my old teacher for guidance on a major decision in my life. He advised me to move to the U.S because I would have more opportunities to succeed and live a better life there. Although it was a difficult decision, I ultimately decided to follow his advice and move to the U.S.

In another situation, my friend asked me for help with her relationship. She was going through a tough time and needed guidance. I could tell she was struggling and offered her advice. I told her that she needed to break up with her partner, who was not good for her. Although it was a difficult decision, I knew it was the right one.

Some people may argue that self-reliance is more important than seeking guidance from others. However, I believe that it is not always bad to ask for help. In fact, seeking guidance can make decisions easier and more informed. It is important to remember that seeking guidance from experts can be valuable, even if it means going against one's own instincts.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

CD52F56B2392," I disagree with the school board's decision to increase the school hours. While it may seem like a good idea to give students more time to learn and complete their school work, the reality is that it will only create more problems for students and teachers.

Firstly, students already have a lot of responsibilities outside of school, such as homework, after-school activities, and family obligations. Adding more time to the school day will only make it harder for students to balance these responsibilities and still make time for their school work. This could lead to students falling behind in their studies and struggling to keep up with their coursework.

Secondly, teachers already have a lot of work to do, including lesson planning, grading assignments, and preparing for exams. Adding more time to the school day will only make it harder for teachers to manage their workload and still provide their students with the support and guidance they need. This could lead to teachers becoming overwhelmed and burnt out, which could have a negative impact on the quality of education students receive.

Finally, students already have a lot of pressure to perform well in school. Adding more time to the school day will only make it harder for students to manage their stress and anxiety, which could lead to mental health issues and other negative outcomes. This could also lead to students becoming disengaged from their studies and not taking their education seriously.

In conclusion, while it may seem like a good idea to give students more time to learn and complete their school work, the reality is that it will only create more problems for students and teachers. The school board should instead focus on finding ways to support students and teachers in managing their workload and balancing their responsibilities, rather than simply increasing the school day.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

7C7FF43FD926,"My views on technology being used to read students emotional expressions is, that I am against this idea in certain cases. I feel like this could go agaisnt someones privacy and the way others can view them in certain different ways they did before. I don't believe that people should use technology to figure out if someone is feeling sad, happy, angry, confused etc.. because it is there privacy and not for anyone else to know unless you tell them so.

Another reason I can give is that the technology is almsot pointless when we can do this ourselves, they say it themselves ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the simple look on their face"" The technology isnt needed when we can do this with our very own two eyes, The point of the techhnology is to give an accurate hypothosis of how we are feeling when we can give that just by talking to someone. There has been times where I've been texting people and know what there emotions is like just by texting them, when we get to know someone well enough we can sense if something is bothering them. This technology on the other hand takes that part of building a relationship with someone to a lower level, you would already know their emotions even in the classroom.

The last example I have is the fact that people can fake there emotons and people do it all the time. It is a tendency and human nature to put on a mask to hide if we are sad or hurt by something because at times we dont wanna hurt people. We could hide the way we feel all we want, because the computer doesnt know whats on the inside, it knows whats on the outside, which in another example in the first sentence saying ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" That is an example of the Leonardo Da Vinvi's ""Mona lise"" the question I have is how do we know thats how she actually feels? He doing a portait not telling her to show how she really feels while he paints. What I am getting at is, it is easy to put on a mask when everything does feel okay.

In conclusion, I don't think this technology is a bad idea, but I feel like it is not needed when we can figure it out just as much the computer can, just maybe not as on point so to speak, but it is someones privacy and not anyones elses unless the person chooses to say.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
AF4152FBC8DA,"Many schools require their students to complete summer projects, but are they given the freedom of making their own product? Some students would prefer to have their teacher assign them a certain project because they struggle to find something that interests them. However, most students prefer to come up with their own idea. Summer projects should be student-designed because it helps develop their work ethic, students can not copy off of other projects, and the final product will be more polished.

Allowing students to design their own type of project would make them more interested in it, and help develop their work ethic. Everyone is interested in different subjects, and not everyone thinks the same way. Giving students the freedom of working on a project in which they find interesting will greatly increase their work ethic. It is crucial that students are developing their minds all year round. When students return to school, they feel like it is their first day of school in their lives. Providing students with the option of working on a project which interests them will make them more prepared for the start of the shcool year. The best students have a great work ethic. They are able to do alot of work for a long time. The more interested a student is in their work, the more they will want to do it.

When teachers assign students work, it is very easy for them to copy ideas. Teachers will assign the same work to all their students, and the students will not do thier own work. When students copy off of other people, they are not gaining any skills, nor learning how to be independent. Allowing students to create their own projects will enhance their creativity, and encourage them to think outside the box. The purpose of school is help young kids find what interests them. No one wants to do something that does not interest them. Therefore, students will not do their own work. Students will do their own work if they are interested in the subject, and allowing them to create their own product is how to accomplish this..

Lastly, allowing students to design their own project will provide a better, more polished final product. It is very easy to create a project on something if the individual is familiar with the idea. The more interested someone is in a certain subject, the better the product will be. For example, it is difficult to write an essay on something that is unfamiliar, or not interesting. On the contrary, it is easy for an individual to write an essay on something that interestes them, or they know alot about. This idea can apply to almost anything, especially a school project. It is hard to find the drive to do schoolwork over summer, but it helps if students are allowed to choose their own assignment, and if students want to work on the project, their final product will be better.

Their are many benefits to allowing students to create their own projects. Their product will be better, they will do it themselves, and it helps develop their work ethic. Finding ways to encourage students to complete their summer work can be challenging, but giving them the freedom of doing something they find interesting is the best way to create an incentive. Their are some benifits to teacher-assigned work, but enabling students to think for themselves is more important.                ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
9E478C982AD0,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having a policy where students are allowed to use their cellphones during lunch and free time has both benefits and drawbacks. While it may seem like a simple solution to allow students to use their phones during these times, there are several factors that must be considered before making a decision.

On the one hand, allowing students to use their phones during lunch and free time can have several benefits. For one, it can help students stay connected with their friends and family, especially during times when they may not see each other often. Additionally, it can provide students with a way to pass the time and stay entertained during free periods, which can help to alleviate boredom and improve their overall mood. Furthermore, it can also allow students to access important information and resources, such as study materials or homework assignments, which can help them to stay on top of their work.

On the other hand, there are also several drawbacks to this policy. For one, allowing students to use their phones during lunch and free time can be a major distraction, and can prevent students from focusing on their work or engaging in meaningful conversations with their peers. Additionally, it can also lead to a decrease in social skills and a lack of face-to-face interaction, which can have negative effects on students' overall development. Furthermore, it can also create a safety concern, as students may be more vulnerable to cyberbullying or other forms of online harassment when they are not supervised.

In conclusion, while there are certainly benefits to allowing students to use their cellphones during lunch and free time, there are also several drawbacks that must be considered before making a decision. Ultimately, it is up to the school administration to weigh the pros and cons and make a decision that is in the best interest of the students. However, it is important to remember that students' well-being should always be the top priority, and any policy that may negatively impact their social skills or safety should be carefully considered before being implemented.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,5
0FA5C20D0027,"Driverless cars are coming thats no good! Since 2009 google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions. Thier cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless. The Google cars still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues.

In my opion driverless cars are pretty dangerous and stupid. I think that becasue drivers would try to play on their phone more and do other things that will not make them keep their eyes on the road or their surroundings. Just because the cars are ""driverless"" doesn't mean they cant mess up or have a glitch when they are driving and when they are playing on their phones. Having driverless cars is a huge mistakes they will put peoples life at risk and so many people when end up wrecking and dieing because they are more worried about their mobile devices.

My second reason I think ""driverless"" cars are stupid is becasue people will not pay attention to their surrounding. People will pay attention to the things that are inside the car and not the things outside the car like other cars around them or even other object around them. People driving the car will be more focoused on the radio or all the cool features that come with the car like the new bluetooth radio or the new settting on the radio. The new cars will have so many new featrues that people will not even realize they are on the road.

My last reason I think the cars are stupid is becasue what are people gonna do when the car breaks or glitches up. The first batch of cars will have issues just like the first batch of everything that is new. The car could glitch up at any moment when the car is in motion and some one is in it. What are people gonna do when they are driving and the car just stops driving itself and runs off the road into oncoming traffic or runs off a mountain. What are the people gonna do when their family memebrs die because of the cars glitching up and killing their brother,sister, or cousin. The first thing they are going to do is blame the company and sue them for everything they have.

That is why I think ""driverless"" cars are stupid and dangerous. People will not pay attention they will car more about their phone. People will not pay attention to their surrounding they will pay attention to things inside the car. And the cars have a high chance of glitching up and killing the driver or maybe another person in the street or on the sidewalk. That is why I think they are very dumb and dangerous.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

C7142A26576B,"A mission of going to Venus is impossible for us, well atleast right now. In the future there is probably going to be a very high chance to visit the Earth like planet but right now, I don't see the possibilty of that happening. I think our focus should be exploring Mars, I think it's a more realistic mission. The author does have some good evidence to back up on why there's a possibility to explore Venus.

The author said that Venus is Earth's ""twin"" and that is true! Venus is the, ""closest planet to Eartth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."". Venus probably had what Earth has right now which are oceans. Even now, Venus is similar to Earth in terms of surface. The planet has a rocky surface and sediment and also similar valleys, mountains, etc but it's not all good stuff about Venus, the planet also has enviroments that are not suitable for human life and I don't think it will anytime soon in my life time. The author does talk about it and gives facts on why it's hard to explore Venus. It has ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"". The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid, the surface of Venus is a flaming 800+ degrees Fahrenheit. That's hot! The pressure alone is 90 times greater than Earth. A submarine accustomed to dive into our deep ocean would be crushed on the Venus surface. We won't be able to see through the thick clouds even if we hovered the planet. Therefore, it would be nearly impossible to et samples of anything!

After all, I think NASA and other private rocket organizations should just focus on going to Mars which like Venus, it's going to be hard. They should see it as a challenge which im sure they do but Mars should be our focus. The author gave good reasons on why we should and shouldn't explore Venus. Which ever planet gets explored first really won't matter. It's history being made for humans and that's what matters in my opinion.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
32612321B31E,"I think we should be able to bring our phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as its turned off during class. I think so because if we could use them at lunch and free time we wouldn't have to use it in class and we would be paying attention instead of texting in class. The reason i choose policy 1 is when we have free time in between classes we could use our phones instead of having to hide them and not pay any attention in class, when we could use them and then be able to pay attention in class and have better grades. If we were able to use our phones in school when we were at lunch or had free time we would have better grades because we're paying more attention in class instead of trying to hide our phones under the desk and not paying any attention at all, because we're hiding them.

If there was an emergency and we were at lunch and we couldn't have our phones we wouldn't know what to do because we would get in trouble for having it out, and if we could have it with us at lunch we would be able to know what's going on. When we aren't able to have our phones on us and we do and it goes off it disrupts the class and we don't learn as much as were suppose too. Then if we have policy 1 you wouldn't have to worry about any phones going off or being token up because we would have done everything we had too at lunch or our free time. Sometimes students need a break from the learning and just need to use their phones to get their minds off things. Sometimes students with a phone can only use it when their in school because something's happening at home and they can only talk to the person at school. But again students would be better if we were able to use our phones at lunch or free time.

When teacher's sees students cell phones they take it up and they won't ask ""oh why do you have your phone?"" no they just take it up and if it was an emergency they wouldn't know because they didn't ask. Sometimes most students use their phones in school because either something happened to their family members' or their parents have to talk to them about something that they forgot when the saw them in the morning. Most students are talking to their parents when the get caught in class. When students use their phones in class its sometimes really important and they get their phones token up because the teacher saw it and they were lecturing in class.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
882F6EC806E9,"Okay, I'll do my best to write like a real 8th grader! Here is my essay:

Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about having a positive attitude in life. I think it's really important to have a positive attitude because it can help you reach your goals and be happy. Like, if you're trying to get good grades in school, having a positive attitude can help you stay motivated and focused. You're more likely to put in the effort and time to study and do your homework if you're feeling good about yourself and your abilities.

But, if you don't have a positive attitude, it can be really hard to achieve your goals. You might get discouraged and give up, or you might not even try hard enough. And, it's not just about school. Having a positive attitude can help you in all areas of your life. Like, if you're trying to make new friends, having a positive attitude can help you be more outgoing and friendly. Or, if you're trying to get a job, having a positive attitude can help you be more confident and professional.

On the other hand, not having a positive attitude can be really bad. Like, if you're always feeling down or negative, it can be hard to enjoy things and find happiness. You might start to believe that you can't do things, or that you're not good enough, and that can be really limiting. And, it can also affect your relationships with other people. If you're always complaining or being negative, people might start to avoid you or not want to be around you.

So, how can you develop a positive attitude? Well, one thing you can do is try to focus on the good things in your life. Like, instead of thinking about all the things that are going wrong, try to think about all the things that are going right. And, try to be more grateful. Like, instead of complaining about something, try to think of something you're thankful for.

68D68DA97502,"Imagine you're a teacher and you have to grade a project that you had no part in creating. Some schools are considering allowing students to design their own summer assignments. This would be counter-productive because, if students were allowed to design their own summer projects they would make the projects entirely too easy. When teachers design the summer assignment they can make sure that it follows the curriculum. It is also easier for teachers to grade assignments that they designed.

Some people believe that, allowing students to create their own assignments would increase the number of students who complete summer assignments. However, many students would create a project that would not teach them anything, and be a waste of time. More students would turn in assignments at the beginning of the school year, but the quality of many assignments would be very poor. What would happen is, students would spend all summer playing games and enjoying their break, and then the last couple days of break would be to throw together a project without putting any thought into it.

Secondly, when teachers design projects they can be sure that it follows the curriculum and provides a smooth transition from one school year to the next. If students were to design their summer assignments, without knowing the curriculum of the coming school year, the assignments would have little to no relevance to the course. This could confuse students when the subject matter of the course is completely different from the summer assignment. It is important for the summer assignments to be designed by the teachers, to ensure that they actually apply to the class that they are assigned by.

Lastly, it is easier for teachers to grade projects that they created. The beginning of the school year is a busy, and stressful, time for everyone. Teachers do not need the extra stress of having to grade dozens of projects that are all designed differently. It is much easier for teachers to grade the dozens of projects when all of the projects follow the same basic guidelines. When projects are designed by the teachers who will grade them it greatly reduces the stress on the teachers in the, already hectic, beginning of the school year.

In conclusion, summer assignments should be designed by teachers, so that they can be sure that the assignments are an appropriate difficulty, relevant to the coursework, and have the same structure. I encourage you to speak with, call, or email members of your local school board to prevent this proposed change. For the good of the students, as well as teachers.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

I'm super excited to write this essay about why I think we should change the policy on students joining sports. I know you're always looking for ways to make our school the best it can be, and I think this is a super important change that could have a really positive impact on us students. 🤩

So, here's my main argument: joining sports should be optional for all students! 🏀🏈🏋️‍♀️ I know, I know, some people might think it's important for us to have a sports team, but let me tell you why I think it's better for it to be optional.

First of all, not everyone is interested in sports. Like, at all. And that's totally okay! 🙅‍♀️ Some people might not like the idea of sweating all the time, or they might not be good at it, or they might just plain not enjoy it. And that's fine! We should respect people's choices and let them decide whether or not they want to join a sports team. It's not fair to force people to do something they don't want to do, especially when there are so many other cool things we could be doing in school. 🤔

Another reason why I think this change would be awesome is that it would give us more time to focus on our studies. 📚📝 I know some people might say that sports are important for our health and fitness, but let's be real, we can get exercise in other ways too! Like, have you seen the gym at our school? It's gotta be one of the best in the district! 🏋️‍♂️ And if we don't have to join a sports team, we can use that time to work on our grades and get better at our favorite subjects. Trust me, being smart is way cooler than being good at sports. 😎

So, adding one and a half extra hours to the school day.  I don't know if this is a good idea or not. I mean, on one hand, it would give us more time to learn stuff. But on the other hand, it would be super annoying to have to be at school for even longer. 

Like, think about it. We're already at school for like, eight hours a day. That's a long time. And now they want to add even more time to that? It's like, how much learning can one person do in a day?  I mean, I know some people might say that it's good to have more time in school, but I'm not sure I agree.

For one thing, it would be really hard to focus for that long. I mean, I'm already having trouble paying attention in class during the regular school day. If we had to be at school for longer, I don't know how I would make it through.  And plus, it would be super boring.

I mean, I know some people might say that school is important and all, but so are our hobbies and interests. And if we don't have time for them, then what's the point?

I no its suppossed to help us relax and focus but I dont think its worcking. I mean, how many times have you sat in class and your mind starts to wander? You start thinking about your weekend plans or that cute boy in your class and BAM! You just lost 10 minutes of learning.

And what about the kids who cant sit still? They'll just get in trouble for fidgeting and it'll be a distraction for everyone else. My friend has ADHD and she cant sit still for more than 5 minutes without getting up and walking around. She'd get in so much trouble if they made her do meditation.

Plus, its not fair to the kids who dont want to do it. I no some people who are athiests and they dont want to do something that's ""spiritual"" or ""religious"". They shuldnt be forced to do something that goes against their beliefs.

And what about the teachers? They have enough to do already without having to learn how to teach meditation. They're already overworked and underpaid. We shuld be focusing on giving them more resources and support instead of adding more things to their plate.

In conclusion, meditation and mindfullness shuldnt be included in schools. Its a waste of time, unfair to some students, and a distraction. We shuld be focusing on giving teachers more support and resources so they can do their job to the best of their ability.

Principal,

Most people would argues that allowing students to have their cell phones would be a distraction well no not really and it would be a good thing not to really use a cell phone but to be able to have it just in case let me tell you why.

1. like me many students do after school activities such as sports or academic UIL activities and these require many hours of long hard work well after practice for theses events is over you need a ride over and since the majority of the student body doesn't have cars we need a way to contact our parents so if we weren't allowed to bring our cell phones to school we would have to use a school telephone and that could take a long time. For example in our coaches office their is one phone that allow us to us so imagine if 45 kids trying using that one phone it would really be a hassle. Plus most kids that have cell phone don't even get them out during the day so what it hurt allowing us to have our cell phones.

2. What if their was a intruder on campus wouldn't you want he police to get their as fast as they could well if their kids had their cell phones the police would about a hundred responses in about a minute same thing with a fire or any other emergency. So over all yes Kids should be allowed to have their cell phones at crowd.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

I dont think that the principle should be able to make the students do an extracurricular activity that they dont want to do or like doing and if they dont want to they shouldnt have to maybe if they like doing student council, sports or working on the schools yearbook then they can.

One of the main reasons i say that students should be able to choose whether or not they do an extracurricular activity is because if the principle makes the student do an extracurricular activity that the student doesnt like and if there is some other students that actually want to do that activity what ever that might be it might be full of kids already so the kids that actually want to do that activity he or she cant do that now because the class might be full and there is a kid in there that doesnt even want to do the activitty he or she got put in.

Its just smarter in general because theres also the kids that will complain about anything and if u just let them choose what ever activity they want to be in they can thats if they even want to be in anything if not then they just dont do any sports, student council or working on the schools yearbook but i definetley dont think that the principle should be able to choose what u do in school just like u get to pick your classes most the time but if they are full then u get other choices.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

llama_70b_v1995,"I think the minimum wage should be raised in my country. The minimum wage has not kept up with the cost of living, and many people who work full-time jobs still live in poverty. This is not fair because people who work hard should be able to afford basic things like food, housing, and healthcare.

Another reason why the minimum wage should be raised is that it would help reduce income inequality. The rich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer, and raising the minimum wage would help to balance this out a bit. It would also help to stimulate the economy because people who earn more money are more likely to spend it, which would boost economic growth.

Additionally, raising the minimum wage would help to increase the standard of living for everyone. People would have more money to spend on education, healthcare, and other important things that improve their quality of life. It would also help to reduce the number of people who are reliant on government assistance programs, which would save taxpayers money in the long run.

However, some people argue that raising the minimum wage could lead to job losses and decreased economic growth. They say that businesses would be less likely to hire people if they had to pay them more. But I think this is a short-sighted view. Businesses would adjust to the new minimum wage and find ways to make up for the increased costs. They might even benefit from having more productive and motivated employees who are paid a fair wage.

In conclusion, I think raising the minimum wage would be a positive change for my country. It would help to reduce poverty and income inequality, increase the standard of living, and stimulate the economy.

Places like Germany, Paris, and Bogota have banned the usage of cars. They say that since they have did that congestion in the cities have gone down. Polluted cities aren't as crowded as they use to since they have banned the usage of cars.

Vauban, Germany is one of the places that has banned the usage of cars. You can still own a car but there are only two places to park your car, large garages at the end of a development or buy a psace along with a home. In article one it stated that,  ""More than 70 percent of Vauban's familis do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here,"" People siad that having a car was tense and kind of too much pressure when in a crowded city. In 2006 Vauban had become an example of  a growing trend in Europe. Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a square mile, they have been the most advanced experiment in low car usage. Stores are placed on the walk away or on a main street, rather than in malls or on a distant highway.

Paris have a near-record pollution so they enfroced a partial drivning ban the clear some of the air in the global city. Motorists with even and odd-numbered license plates were ordered to leave thier cars at home or they suffer and fine of 22-euros. Around 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty-sevn people had thier cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. Congestion was down nearly 60 percent in the capital of France after five days after the enforement of the driving fine. SInce Paris has generally more smog than other European capitals diesel fueal was blamed for it. Diesel fuel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. Delivery companies complained about the lost of revenue for cars. In aritcle two it siad, ""Public transportation was free of charge from Friday to Monday,"" the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for odd-numbered car plates on Tuesday.

Bogota, Columbia have banned usage of cars for three years straight. Cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day. Thier goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Anybody that violated that suffered a fine of $25 dollars. Aritcle 3 buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It;s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" meaning that cutting down car usage with lower the greenhouse gases in the air and clear it up.

Parks and sport centers and have bulid throughout the city. Pitted sidewalks have been replaced with smooth sidewalks, rush-hour restirctions have cut traffic dramatically, new resturants and upscale shopping ditstricts have cropped up. Bannig cars in Bogota has been the best thing that has ever happened to the city.

In 2013, President Obama had ambitious goals to curb the United States's greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies have shown that many Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years go by. In article 4 it said that ""as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995,"" part of that is because many Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. Demographic shifts in the driving population have made the trend of banning car accelerate.

In conclusion, banning cars will a successful rate on not just the United States but the world. Maybe people should actually look and promote the idea to see if it will help our economy and or environment. Without cars polluted cities will be able to breath fresh air and won't have to worry about payign for gas.

60D8EB883A45,"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For this essay, I'm gonna talk about that cool quote from Thomas Jefferson, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" It's like, super deep and stuff. 🤔

So, let's start with the advantages of actively doing something to accomplish our goals. When we're always doing something, we can get a lot done! Like, think about it, if you're always working on that science project for school, you're gonna get it done way faster than if you just sit around and do nothing. And that's not all, when we're always doing something, we feel more productive and stuff. It's like, we're not just sitting around twiddling our thumbs, we're actually making progress towards our goals! 💪

But, there are also some drawbacks to always doing something. Like, sometimes we can get so busy doing stuff that we forget to take breaks and relax. And when we're always on the go, we can start to feel burnt out and stressed out. It's like, we need to find that balance between doing stuff and taking breaks, you know? 😅

And then there's the thing about not doing anything. Like, sometimes it's okay to take a break and just chill. I mean, think about it, if you're always doing something, you might not have time to think about what you really want to do. So, it's important to have some downtime and just relax. It's like, we need to find that balance between always doing something and not doing anything. 🤔

So, in conclusion, it's important to find that balance between always doing something and not doing anything. When we're always doing something, we can get a lot done, but we also need to make sure we're not getting burnt out.

B43F583ECE54,"Soccer, student council, and debate are all examples of extra curricular activities that will benefit students greatly in their future. You learn many life lessons while playing a sport, communicating with others, and debating. Being exposed to this type of activity from a young age will ensure your success in later years.

Playing a sport teaches you resilience, and how to work with a team. Loosing a sports game does not feel good but its something every one has experienced. Although not everyone knows how to handle losing. When you are taught from a young age how to be resilient and bounce back from a lose, it will be much easier to handle those losses as an adult. Playing a sport also requires team work, you have to work with your team to score a goal. Learning how to communicate with your team mates is very similar to communication in the work place.

Being on the student council is all about communicating with your peers. If this communicating is not done properly or clearly it will be very hard to get work done. When you get a job as an adult clear communication will be mandatory. If you do not communicate properly, someone could end up doing something differently then you intended. In student council, students will learn how to communicate with their peers. By doing this, communication as adults will be much easier. Even in disagreements your communication will be essential.

Debate teaches students how to argue respectfully while still getting your point across. You will encounter many arguments in your life so knowing a way to argue with out hurting anyone is a curtail life lesson. Arguments between friends, and families are very common, but these are people you love and always want by your side. Knowing how to argue kindly and not escalating to a fight is very important.

School offering a variety of mandatory extracurricular actives is a great idea. This way students can learn important life lessons while doing something they enjoy. These actives teach children important lessons from knowing how to handle losing, communication with others, and even how to respectfully settle an argument. Being exposed to this type of activity from a young age will ensure great success in later years of life.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
2D7D270917C0,"Every four years america as a whole chooses on who should be the president of the united states. The process of election is straight forward and always follows the same process every election. The american citizens vote on one of the two candidates, then those votes are counted and giving to the electors, then the electors of each state representing the population of said state (including the District of Columbia) votes one of the candidates, after all votes are tallied the winning candidate is elected president. Overall this system seems rather complicated and can be seen as an unfair process at which only to vote on who takes charge of america. The electoral college should be replaced by who receives the most popular votes from all american citizens and not the state electorals.

Electoral college is a process created during the founding of the united states as sort of a ""middleground"" or compromise on how the people of the country should elect the president (

source 1

). In order for a president to be elected out of the 538 electors that make up the electoral college he or she must at least receive 270 votes (

source 1

). Each president has a group of electors that process your votes in order to choose who the state votes for making it in a ways unfair. This system can come with its own set of problems that include replacement of electors, electors voting to who they feel, and at times one candidate gaining the most popular vote but losing the chance of presidency because of the lack of electorol votes form the state (

source 2

). An example of the unbalanced power is the near success of the louisiana legislature replacing the democratic electors in the 1960, segrigations with new ones that would oppose against John F. Kennedy making him lose the popular vote.

The best replacement for the electoral college is to allow the citizens of america to vote upon who should be the president of the U.S without the need for electors. The candidate that receives the most votes is the one who becomes the president of the united states. In order to process all possible millions of votes into a rational percentage and the candidate with the higher percentage would in turn become president. With this in mind the candidates would need to visit all or largely selected states in order to deliver campaign speeches to persuade the population to vote for them, because with the electoral college system candidates would focus mainly on tight races in the ""swing states"" practically ignoring other like in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt see their candidate (

source 2

). The electoral college only focuses on the large numbers and not on the smaller population that can still make a difference making the system unfair. Making them only focus on the big states because how many electoral votes it could bring compared to a smaller state which could possibly only supply three.

On the other side electoral college does have a good standing as a method of vote. Electoral college has five good reasons on why it shouldn't be replaced and they are certainty of outcom, everyone's president, swing states, Big states, and avoid run-off elections (

source 3

). Each campaign party chooses their electors which rarely end in betrayel making it possible to win the election with low popularity votes. The electoral system also gives the candidate a chance to win in a ""landslide"" because of the winner-take-all basis at which it follows (

source 3

). No region has enough votes to elect a president also the electoral college needs to have transregional appeal. And the main goal of the electoral college is to obviously elect a new president but as well avoid runoff elections.

The electoral college is an unfair system of voting because of how it all depends on a small group of selected representatives and not all of the american population as a whole. Even though it can be regarded as a fair middle ground it still has its flaws and doesnt reach out to society as a whole only focusing on the states that can lead to victory, casting out those who's electoral votes will not make much of a difference. In the end the voting system should mainly focus on popularity of a candidate than what the ""state"" feels they should vote for because of how many votes they actually received for a given candidate due to the fact that it may end up voting on which who they feel and refuse to vote for their partys candidate. The electoral system should be replaced.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
5C3B847556AC,"The Electoral College has been in the Constitution since out founding fathers established it.  It was an agreement between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of President by a popular vote of citizens.

As we all know the Electoral College is a process which is the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress.  There are two political parties. Democrats and Republicans. Electors are usually chosen by the person running for office's political party, but each state has their different views on how they are selected and what their responsibilities are.  When the time comes, usually every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, presidential elections are held. This is the day citizens go out to their local polls and help their electors vote for President. It's not the citizens themselves who vote for the President, when citizens vote they're actually voting for their canidates electors.  The process of the Electoral College has been carried on since it was first put into the Constitiution. So, why change it now?

The Electoral College consists of over 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.  The citizens vote sometime in November in polls and wait for the election of the new President. As stated before, the citizens vote does not elect the president, it helps the electors choose. However, that doesn't mean that the citizens don't have a purpopse in voting. Popular vote is part of an election as well. It is rare that the Electoral College is higher in numbers that its popular votes. This is sometimes because states award electoral votes on a winner-takes-all rubric.

This process requires a canidate to have trans-regional appeal, meaning there aren't favorites. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.  This also means the presidential canidate will not gain any electoral votes by increasing his popularity in states they know they'll win in. This is a highly unlikely result that will outcome as a successful president. If this were to occur, voters in other states would feel discouraged and feel as if their votes do not count. This is why the Electoral College has this as a requirement.

In most toss-up states, voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and deciding or knowing who that they will decide to be president. They are most likely thoughtful voters and are perferred to be the ones to decide the election. In big states, the Electoral College adjusts the weight in the political balance that these states lose by population. In additon, large states get more attention of canidates in a campaign that the smaller states do.

These are just few of many resons why the Electoral college should stay as is. If they were to change the Electoral College, what would they do to elect a president? It would be chaotic and the people may rebel. In conclusion, keeping the Electoral College as it is should be the only process to elect a president.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

As an 8th grader, I've noticed how technology has taken over our lives and how it's limiting our human contact.  It's like, we're all so focused on our screens that we've forgotten how to connect with each other face-to-face. 

I mean, think about it. How many times have you had a deep conversation with someone while you were both staring at your phones?  I know I've definitely done that way too many times. And it's not just conversations. Think about how technology is limiting our ability to empathize with others.  Like, when someone's upset, instead of being there for them, we're all like, ""Hey, are you okay?  Can you send me a pic of what's wrong?""  It's like, come on, man!

8baf0811,"Dear State Senator, we should not keep the Electoral College. I'm in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. The electorsal college is unfair. It's outdated and irrational. Many people prefer election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote directly towards the president. They shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president.

One of my reasons is because under the electorsal college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electorss, who in turn elect for the president. The electorss can be anyone not holding public office. Depending on the state, the electorss are picked by state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. The electorsal college isn't the best way to handle elections because it is the electorss who elect the president, not the people, which to me sounds unfair. Voters can't always control who their electorss will vote for and voters do get confused sometimes about the electorss. So if you really agreed on one president, chances are that might not be the president who's gonna be elected because the electorss can choose the other person running for president instead.

The electorsal college is unfair. The electorsal college consists of 538 electorss. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the president. Richard Nixo, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all agreed on abolishing the electorsal act. According to a gallop poll in 2000, over sixty percent of voter would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Voters don't want the popular vote winner to lose the presidency but because of the electorsal college it can happen. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electorss.

Lets say that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electorss. Those electorss can always defy the will of the people. Faithless electorss have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they pleased. Why on earth would they do such a thing. They should care about what voters believe in. In 1960, people who favored separation based on race in the Louisiana legislature nearly actually succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with new electorss so that they would oppose John F. Kennedy. This means the popular votes would not have actually gone to Kennedy. That is not fair. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. They focus only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

State Senator, I'm in favor of changing to election by popular votes because it's fair. The electorsal college should stay in the past and should'nt be used anymore. The best way is for the election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote directly towards the president. Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and decided to vote for whoever they wanted. Selfish much? People shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president. These electorss should consider what the people want. I believe Elections by popular votes for president of the united states is the best option.",0,train_essays,,6

They ask more than one person because they want to see if the advice there getting is true and if there getting lied to or not receiving the right type of information.

Also if you want to see if all of it makes sense its not that they do not trust you its that you dont trust yourself. It is known to ask different people for advice i do it and so do you.

Whenever you have a problem you think that you should go to an adult right? Well in my opinion no because we kids believe it or not have understand and better at giving advice in my opinion. Kids understand because we will likely 8/10 have gone through it. We should all ask different people for advice so you know how to approach a situation. There is always people that can help you exactly people your age. I think people at the 14-19 life stand could understand you more than an 35-50 year old could.

How you approach a situation in advice matter. First you have to find a couple true companionship. Second you want to sit them down and have a real conversation about how life is going. Then you go to the issue on had and discuss the matter on hand. Last you add up all the evidence then you decide on what you want to do. Then you make a decision on hand and handle the issue.

You are gonna have to tell an adult eventually and tell them whats going on but not at the moment when you have to come to a desiton of what you are going to do. they can move at there on pace when the person is ready to handle the issue it will be resolved.

DE2DAA2A9345,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Our sports teams are already small as they are with the failing grade policy.

With the new change in policy the teams will shrink dramatically unless the grades rise of the athletes.

However that is not a safe bet because the average grade is a C and averages are hard to raise.

Even though I am not on a sports team I am still writing this to help our sports teams be better with grades and sports.

If this grade plan falls through it will possibly not only destroy our sports teams and their records but possibly cause chaos in the academic field. It may because the athletes need to blow off steam or give them exercise to not only their muscles but also the brain.

There is even science that proves that exercise helps development of a healthy and strong brain.

Now that does not say its useless.

A better plan of action for this would be having weekly grade meetings with the coach.

Then the next step is having the parents actually get up and check on the grades of their children.

Another step and the most important one is if the child or children have a lot of homework or work the parents will enforce the law of whether or not the child stays home and studies or goes to practice.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Firs impression can be change in some people because you can related to the person, You can talk to the person if is having a bad time, sometimes you can change the first impression to a person.

When i was in middle school i meet a girl, her name was Generic_Name, i didn't like her first impression and i noticed that she didn't like my impresion too. She was my neirbor for 3 years and she didn't talk to much and she was always angry. One day i notice that she was having problems with friends, like me. We were relatived to some things and our first impression.

Sometimes people can be having bad times and that is why their first impression it seems difficult to change. I had a friend that it was having a bad day at work the first time i meet him. Generic_Name was angry and he didn't talk to me that day. After that day i was surprised of his impression . Days after he explain what was happening to him that day.

If you meet a person more closedly you can change their first impression. You can be come a friend to the person, sometimes they change. You would like more that person than the first time. LIke i said before , they can have bad times the first time you see their impression. Not everyone is happy every day.

First impression is not difficult to change , people can due it and people can change it. some said that is impossible to change first impression , but is not , if i can due it with some people , you too can change it.

In the future we will see that first impression is not impossible to be change.",0,original_moth,Task: Compare a first impression you had of someone with how that impression changed when you got to know that person better. Use a specific example to illustrate your point.,1

F6CFA4C7247B,"Have you ever seen something that looked like a extra terestrial sight like crop circles, well NASA's Viking 1 saw something that looked like an egyptian face while circling Mars looking for a place for its sister ship (Viking 2).

In 1976, a photo of what was though to be a Ancient Egyptian Face turned out to be a hoax (unintentionally) and was actually just a Land formation with inclined rocks that formed a Shadow that conveyed illusions of two eyes a nose and a mouth. At first this was a very succesful and popular image, a section from the article states that "" The Face On Mars has becoma a pop icon, that starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk show and even haunted stores for 25 years"". this states that this photo was a clear sign of Extarestrial life, at least at the time.

Although many people beleived this theory was a Alien artifact it was eventually disproven on April 5, 1998 as shown on the article ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"".

Allthough many people still believe that scientists must have missed something and that it really is a allien artifact sorry to burtst your bubble but, you are wrong. See Scientists have been working on this theory for very many years they have gone back and looked at it multiple times, retaken pictures from multiple different angles, Enlarged x3 and still the only thing there is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa.

On april 8, 2001 a Mars Global surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They then rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 156 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1978 Viking photo"".

So from all of the information from this article it is confirmed that ""The Face"" isn't really a extraterestrial artifact, but just a measly illusion.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
DEC50B420484," Working alone or in a group has its own benefits, but which one do you prefer?

Working alone can provide you with more focus and productivity. When you work alone, you have more control over your environment and can concentrate on your tasks without any distractions. You can also work at your own pace and take breaks whenever you need to.

On the other hand, working in a group can be beneficial in several ways. When you work with others, you can share ideas and collaborate on projects. You can also learn from your peers and gain different perspectives on a problem. Working in a group can also help you build relationships and develop communication skills.

However, working in a group can also be a distraction. When you work with others, you may find yourself getting sidetracked and not focusing on the task at hand. It can also be challenging to manage different personalities and work styles within a group.

In my opinion, both working alone and in a group have their own advantages and disadvantages. It ultimately depends on the task and the individual's preferences. If you are working on a task that requires a lot of focus and concentration, working alone may be the best option. However, if you are working on a group project that requires collaboration and teamwork, working in a group may be more beneficial.

Some of the dangers that they will have to deal with it extreme heat. Around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Also there is the insane amount of pressure that will have to overcome. The amount of pressure there is around 90 time bigger than our atmosphere pressure. It is even raining sulfuric acid their. Despite all of these problem they will have to overcome, studying Venus will help us understand things better. For example, one of the things we believe that Venus was just like our planet. Have land, full of ocean, etc. But later something happen to the planet which caused what Venus is like now. If would make a machine that will be able to stand the condintions of Venus, we will most likely understand those things better. Also NASA has an idea to where we would be able to send people there. It would be a blimp like vehicle that would hover above the surface and that would allow us in theory to withstand the ground conditions. But that is only the ground conditions, we would still have extreme heat. But instead of around 800 degrees, it would be around 170 degrees fahrenheit.

falcon_180b_v1_750,"Homework has been a topic of debate for years, with some people arguing that it is an essential part of learning while others believe it puts unnecessary stress on students. As a student in grade 12, I strongly believe that homework is an essential part of learning. Homework helps students to reinforce what they have learned in class, develop good study habits, and become responsible individuals.

Firstly, homework is an excellent way for students to reinforce what they have learned in class. It provides an opportunity for students to practice and apply the knowledge they have gained in class. For example, if a student learns a new math concept in class, homework provides an opportunity for them to practice applying that concept. This practice helps students to understand the concept better and retain the information for a longer period.

Secondly, homework helps students to develop good study habits. It teaches students to manage their time effectively, plan their work, and complete tasks independently. These skills are essential for success in college and beyond. For instance, in college, students are expected to manage their time effectively and complete assignments independently. Therefore, homework in high school prepares students for the demands of college and beyond.

Finally, homework helps students to become responsible individuals. It teaches students to take ownership of their learning and be accountable for their actions. For example, if a student fails to complete their homework, they will receive a lower grade. This consequence teaches students the importance of responsibility and accountability.

In conclusion, homework is an essential part of learning. It helps students to reinforce what they have learned in class, develop good study habits, and become responsible individuals. Therefore, schools should continue to assign homework to students. While it may put some stress on students, the benefits of homework far outweigh the drawbacks.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Some people argue that homework is an essential part of learning, while others believe it puts unnecessary stress on students.

E1EC4869981F," The notion that students should participate in extracurricular activities is an unethical idea. Who would want to waste their time doing something that is not truly beneficial? At school, students have a lot of work to do, and now being involved in another activity might negatively impact their academic goals.

If a student gets involved with the activities, they will not have enough time for their daily work. They will have less time to do their homework or projects. This can cause students to fall behind in their academic goals. They will also have less time to spend with their family, which can lead to problems in their relationships and separations between their families.

Getting involved in these activities can be stressful for students. There will be an additional program added to their daily routine, which contains more work. The work that they did not choose to do, but they have to do. By having stress after all this work, students will not get enough sleep, which is an unhealthy situation.

Having this much pressure can negatively impact students' grades. By spending their time on something that they do not truly want to do, but they have to, it can put them in a lot of pressure which keeps them away from what they want to do. They will join these activities and not focus on their studies. Students will start getting bad grades.

In conclusion, after considering all these reasons, we can all agree that participating in extracurricular activities can be harmful to students. It is neither healthy nor good for grades. All this shows that students should choose to be in the activities if they want to, not that they are forced to.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

For those who opt to complete their secondary education at a younger age, they will have access to an array of longer professional fields to explore, and potentially even establish themselves within sooner than their peers. This could be in fields such as entrepreneurship, coding, web development, project management, analytics, or consulting. The early completion of high school will also open up the doors to more personal opportunities. As a young adult, there are many opportunities for travel, volunteer work, internships, apprenticeships, or even higher education to pursue.

97167C9DC677,"The Castle Standard is a concept that emphasizes striving for excellence in whatever one does. This could mean going above and beyond standards, pushing boundaries, and working diligently to reach a higher level of excellence. For example, an individual striving for excellence could be a young student who works hard to get the highest grades in their class. They might set their own, higher expectations and work diligently to achieve them.

Determination is an essential part of reaching any goal. It involves unwavering commitment and a strong will to succeed in spite of any challenges one may face. An example of determination is a marathon runner who continues running even when their body is exhausted. Despite their fatigue, they have the willpower to cross the finish line.

Goal-setting is an important tool for growth and progress. By setting realistic yet challenging goals, and working diligently towards them, one can slowly but surely reach their destination. An example of how one can reach their goals is a student who sets the goal of passing a tricky exam. Through persistent effort, study, and practice, the student is able to pass the test – and reach their goal.

In conclusion, the Castle Standard is a concept focusing on striving for excellence and going above and beyond the basic requirements.

A way that driverless cars can be a negative thing is because people are not in full control of the car. What would happen if the car all of a sudden starts doing something wrong and the driver can not do anything about it? In paragragh number 7 is says that the car can do a lot of things on its own. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navagating through work zones and around accidence.""

Also if people were interested in buying the diverless car would an average person be able to affort it? In paragragh number 4 it clearly says that the car needs many tools and special equitment to be able to be a driverless car. ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an intertial motion sensor.""

Not only would the car itself cost alot, it would also take millions to be able to fix all the roads in order for the car to be able to drive on the roads. In paragragh number 3 it states that the car requies magnets in the road to be able to read the messages in binary code, but would be too expensive. ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they require massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.""

Finally one of my biggest concerns is that if the driverless car does not need the driver at all times would it make it easier for younger kids to get in the car, start it, and take off? In paragragh number 7 it says that all it takes is the drivers hands to be on the wheel for the car to go. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Since the driverless car can do alot on its own the car could make it easy for a young child to get in it and leave while not being watched properly.

In conclusion, I belive that people should keep driverless cars off the road for many reasons. For example, people are not having full control of the car. The car may not be afordable to the average person. It would take millions for the road to be fixed and be able to have driverless cars to work on the roads.

EA8B2F944034,"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle, because it can be distracting. You should not use any mobile device, while you're driving because that can cause a very bad accident. It's the majority of teenagers that feel like they can use a cellular device while they're on the road. It doesn't matter if you're talking on the phone or texting while driving, it can distract you from paying attention to the road. None of that doesn't matter at that moment, because you could end up losing your life. In this essay, I will be stating the causes, the consequences, and how to prevent others from texting and driving or talking on the phone while they're driving.

There are many dangerous effects of texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving. Well, one danger while texting and driving is people can become distracted and can cause an accident. Another danger while you are driving and texting or talking on the phone is you can hit a pedestrian. Our brains are incapable of giving our attention to more than one activity at a time. So, this means when you are driving and talking on the phone, you're actually splitting your attention between at least two activities. That's why laws were made to prohibit texting and talking while driving.

If you break the law, there are consequences for texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving. The consequences of texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving is that you can get a monetary fine, which can be up to $500, depending on what state you're in. You could also get criminal charges for texting and driving or talking on the phone while you're driving. One of the worst things that could happen is that you could go to jail or prison. This is a very dangerous situation, because you could actually lose your life or take somebody else's life while texting and driving or talking on the phone while you're driving.

There are many ways to prevent others from texting and driving or talking on the phone while driving. Well, one way to prevent others from texting and driving or talking on the phone while driving is to keep your phone out of reach. Blocking incoming texts or calls is another way to prevent you from texting and talking while you're driving. If you just have to talk, pull over and stop if it's very important, if it's not important, just keep your phone out of sight.

Texting while driving is a big issue. People do it everyday, but they don't realize that their lives are in danger and so are others on the road. There are a lot of people dying each and every day, because of phone usage car accidents. Leave the phone alone while you are driving, because a text is not worth a life. That text will be there when you get to your destination. Don't choose to pick up the phone while you're on the road. It's very dangerous, even if it's just talking on the phone for one second.

So therefore, be very cautious of what you do with your phone while you're on the road!                                                               ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

First of all, it's, like, super important for students to have help with their homework. I mean, sometimes it can be really hard to understand stuff, and it's easy to get behind. But if there was an after school homework club, kids could get extra help from teachers or tutors. That way, they can catch up and feel less stressed out. Plus, it's a great way to get help on specific subjects, like math or reading, that might be tricky. 

Secondly, an after school homework club can be a really cool place to hang out with friends. Like, imagine being able to do your homework with your BFFs?  It would be way more fun than doing it alone at home. Plus, you could help each other out and learn from each other. It would be like a study group, but way more chill. 

Lastly, an after school homework club can help students develop good study habits. If kids are in a structured environment, like a club, they might be more likely to stay on task and finish their work. It's also a great way to teach them time management skills, like how to prioritize tasks and set goals.

Even though having a car drive you around would be nice, to me the benefits of driving yourself around are so much more than thoughs of having a car drive you around. Having a car driving you around all the time can create many dangers to the people around you, possible malfunctions can occur to the car, and the joy of driving your own car around would be lost.

The dangers of having a car drive you around would be that the human brain is marter than a computer. We can determain situations better in person than a computer can however many miles away from it you are. While computers are more logistically smarter than humans, we have experiance in everyday life to help us determain how to drive more efficantly.

Havong a self driving car is a great advancment in the technilogical field, but what is saying that there would not be malfunctions. If you are driving approxamently 70 miles on the interstate and the car malfunctions, there can be major risks to your safety and the safety of those around you.

Lastily, when you were little you would always dream about driving your own car one day, but if you have a car driving you around you would lose that freedom feeling. Also, today a lot of people like to drive around when they are streesed because it helps them get there mind off of things, but if you have a car driving you around places you lose the stress free driving time because you are not controling the car.

There is some benefits of having a car drive you around. Some say that the benefits are better than the reasons why we should not have them. But, to me, driverless cars are taking to much away from us and putting us at to much risk to be a good thing.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
1B483C40297E,"Have you wonder how cars can damage our atmosphere? Cars are dangerous because it can produce smog that can kill greenhouse gas. That can cause problems in the world. We can stop it by riding bikes than riding cars. Banned driving  can also help the environment it can stop producing smog that damage the greenhouse gas. Reducing diesel fuel was another reason that can destroy the atmosphere. All of these factors can damage the world unless we do somthing about it.

Riding bikes can reduce smog in the world because instead on gasoline it runs on you. You can ride any where you want without polluting the air around you. Riding bikes depend on you because it does not need gasoline. Also it cost cheaper than a car it stop when you stop. Paris due to driving it was cover in smog the solution was to ban it. Which began hybrids and other types of transportation that does not relied on gasoline. You can also help the atmosphere by riding bicycle every day than drving also can you and your famiily some money than cars that produce hamful smog that can damage the atmosphere. Thanks to bikes more smaller shops were open then a big mall in the middle of the highway.

Banned driving can help atmosphere by stopping smog to be produce while driving. In Bogota they have ban driving for almost there years and the condition is much improving every year. The outcome was that large, gray clouds rain on Bogorta because of ban driving. Ban driving can lead good opportunity to take away stress and reduce air pollution. After banning driving people began to find other transportaion by buliding more roads for walking or biking

Reduce using diseal fuel contribute to dangerous smog covering the world. Diesel fuel was blame when the ""France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline""(Source 2) More than 67% are diesels cars that led to intense smog in France. Reduce disel using can reduce smog, France reduce congestion by 60% after there intense smog. Cold night and warm days cause warm air to be trap in the world. The solution was to drive hybrid cars and free transportation wiithout using disel fuel.

All these factors are still happing today and to stop is to ride bikes or drive hybrids, if not ban driving, also reduce the use of disel fuel can contribute of improve the Earth. It can take a long time before our world is cover in smog than it can be ever replaced. Also thanks to hand held electronics made it easy to commicate than driving to them.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

And on previous mission no spacecraft have ever survived on the planet for more than a few hours . Something else that is very bad for you is that its atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and on the surface of the planet temperature reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit . Some good things about Venus is that it is cloest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and sometimes close in distance .

Also Venus had a surace that is rocky sediment with valleys mountains and craters .

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system and urge you to consider the benefits it brings to the presidential election process. While there are arguments for both keeping the Electoral College and changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides a more balanced and fair representation of the American people's voices.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it offers. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the election result is more predictable and less likely to be disputed compared to a direct popular vote system, as seen in the 2000 election. The winner-take-all method in most states also creates a landslide victory for the winning candidate, further solidifying their legitimacy as the chosen president.

Another important factor to consider is that the Electoral College ensures that the president-elect has trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to solely determine the outcome of the election. This encourages candidates to campaign across different regions and appeal to a diverse range of voters. A candidate with broad appeal is more likely to effectively represent the interests of the entire nation and avoid regional biases.

The Electoral College also emphasizes the importance of swing states, as pointed out by Judge Posner. Toss-up states receive more attention from candidates, leading voters in these states to be more engaged in the campaign and make thoughtful decisions. This focus on swing states ensures that the candidates address the concerns and interests of a wider range of voters, resulting in a more representative outcome for the entire nation.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of big states and small states in the political process. While the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate favors smaller states, the Electoral College allows larger states to maintain influence by granting them more electoral votes. This system ensures that the concerns of both large and small states are taken into account during presidential campaigns, preventing a disproportionate concentration of power.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes. This saves time and resources, allowing for a smoother and more efficient election process. The winner of the electoral vote is the clear victor, avoiding potential political gridlock and uncertainty.

While arguments can be made against the Electoral College, such as the limited attention paid to non-swing states or the potential disenfranchisement of voters in states dominated by one party, it is important to consider the overall benefits of the system. The Electoral College provides a balanced representation of the American people's preferences, ensures the certainty of the election outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, gives weight to swing states, balances the influence of big and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic process and should be retained. It offers a fair and representative system for electing the president, while addressing the practical challenges and complexities of the election process. I trust that as my senator, you will consider these factors when making decisions related to the Electoral College. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Pollution is dangerous and people don't fully understand the costly effects to our everyday living. Transportation is a way of means by transitioning from one place to another. The most popular way of transportation is the vehicle. A fast and easy way to get to your destination with just a turn of the key, or in this case now-a-days, the click of a button.

Acres of land being towed to create bigger roads, or streets because of the vast majority of people using cars to get around. With each car means more gas or diesel, more gas equals more money, and more pollution. Our atmosphere can only take so much from the faulty mistakes we choose to do everyday. Places like Paris and suburbs in Germany are becoming more aware of how much cars can effect our Earth.  After days of near record pollution Paris decided to enforce a 'partial driving ban' to clear some of the air in the global city. The way they enforced this was motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home. The same would apply for the odd numbered license plates the following day. After this, smog and congestion decreased by 60 percent in the capital of France. Other places like Bogota, Columbia is having 'car free day' where millions of people would enjoy their day outside hiking, biking, and taking buses for work during the day. These decisions and actions cleared the streets in Bogota and avoided jams, leaving the people to have a nice day enjoying the outdoors. Carlos Arturo says ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

This doesn't mean give up cars all in all. Rather, limit the use of driving your car. America's love affair with vehicles seem to be dulling down. After 2005, the number of miles driven started to decrease. Part of the explanation to this lies in the recession, because tight budget Americans could'nt afford new cars, and the unemployed were'nt going to work. Sociologists believe if these patterns of decreasing numbers of car owners and people driving-- that it will have beneficial outcomes for carbon emissions and the enviroment. On the opposing side this has a negative effect for the car industries.

The positive effects will benifit future generations to come, with clean air to breathe and a fresh start. By limiting car usage there would be less traffic jams, more people getting in touch with their surroundings and even losing 3 to 5 pounds while they're at it. Transportation is a way of means by transitioning from one place to another, it doesn't always have to be a vehicle with so many other options you can choose from. Make a difference in the world, one less car at a time.             ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

First of all, when you make your own decisions, you learn stuff. Like, actual stuff. You learn how to think critically and solve problems on your own. It's like, you get to be the boss of your own life and make choices that actually matter. It's not like your parents or teachers are gonna do it for you, so you gotta step up and do it yourself. Plus, when you make your own decisions, you feel more in control of your life. It's like, you're not just a passive observer, you're actually making things happen.

Another thing is, when you make your own decisions, you get to be who you really are. Like, you don't have to pretend to be someone else or do things that you don't really want to do. You can just be yourself and do what makes you happy. It's like, you don't have to worry about what other people think, you can just do what feels right for you. And that's a pretty cool feeling, if you ask me.

I mean, maybe you'll make some mistakes, but that's just part of the learning process, you know? It's like, you'll figure things out as you go along and become a better person because of it. And even if you do make bad decisions, at least you'll know that you made them yourself and you can learn from them. It's like, you won't have to blame anyone else for your mistakes.

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in our presidential elections. The Electoral College, as a compromise between election by Congress and popular vote, has served our nation well and should be upheld for several reasons.

First, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of a dispute over the election results. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their popular vote share. With the winner-take-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state results in a significant electoral vote victory. Thus, while a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely.

Second, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As Posner argues, no region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Consequently, candidates with only regional appeal are unlikely to be successful. This system ensures that the president represents and is accountable to the interests of various regions rather than just a specific region.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, ensuring that voters in those states have a significant say in the election. Swing states receive more attention from candidates, leading to more informed and engaged voters. This is crucial in our democracy, as the most thoughtful voters, who pay attention to the competing candidates, should be the ones to decide the election.

Fourth, the Electoral College balances the political power of large and small states. The allocation of electoral votes provides greater weight to large states in proportion to their population, as smaller states typically have a minimum of three electoral votes. This addresses the mal-apportionment of the Senate, ensuring that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, simplifying the presidential election process. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as seen in the examples of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College still produces a clear winner. This avoids the complications and pressures associated with run-off elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states dominated by one party, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections express their political preference rather than thinking that a single vote may decide the election. Despite this knowledge, approximately half of the eligible American population still chose to vote in the 2012 election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a valuable compromise that ensures certainty of outcome, promotes unity, empowers swing states, balances the political power of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is essential for preserving the integrity and effectiveness of our democratic system. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on any potential changes to our election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and our country. I look forward to seeing your continued support for our democratic principles.

Sincerely,

F386245C7C21," Working alone or in a group, which one do you prefer? This is a question that many people ask themselves, and the answer can vary depending on the individual. Some people believe that working in a group is the best way to get things done, while others prefer to work alone. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of both working in a group and working alone, and discuss which one is better for you.

Working in a group can be very beneficial, as it allows you to hear new ideas and perspectives. When working with others, you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with creative solutions to problems. Additionally, working in a group can help you to finish tasks faster, as everyone can work together to complete the task. For example, when my friends and I were working on a project for school, we were able to complete it much faster than if we had been working alone.

On the other hand, working alone can also have its benefits. When working alone, you can be more focused on your work and can be more creative in your own way. This can be especially beneficial for tasks that require a lot of concentration, such as writing a research paper or completing a final exam project. For example, the girl in my biology class who worked alone on her final exam project was able to create a really creative poster that went with the theme of the project. She was able to focus on her work and come up with a unique solution to the problem.

In conclusion, both working in a group and working alone have their own benefits. Working in a group can help you to hear new ideas and finish tasks faster, while working alone can allow you to be more focused and creative. Ultimately, the best way to work will depend on the individual and the task at hand.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

7A7D7BC53938," It's undeniable that having a positive attitude is the key to success. In every aspect of life, whether it's a small action or a major decision, if you lack confidence in what you're doing, it will ultimately lead to failure.

That doesn't mean that failure is a bad thing, as it's an important aspect of success. Not only does it allow you to learn from your mistakes, but it also teaches you what to expect next time and helps you to develop a different mindset, a different plan, and even a different attitude.

However, let's be honest, why would someone fail if they have the chance to succeed? It's because if you're not willing to put in the effort and work towards your goals, why even try? There's a world out there full of opportunities and people who are hungry for success, and if you're not giving it your all, you're not taking advantage of those opportunities.

That's where a positive attitude comes in. If you know your worth and are willing to give 100% of your effort, you don't have to worry about failure. You'll be confident in your abilities and will go after what you want, regardless of what others may say or the cost of it.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is crucial to achieving success in any aspect of life. It allows you to learn from your mistakes, develop a different mindset, and put in the effort needed to achieve your goals. So, don't be afraid to take risks and put yourself out there - the rewards will be worth it in the end.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

5678FA78260F,"Think about the time you felt extremely tired. That time where you could barely keep your eyes open, everything you heard was a blob, because you were simply zoned out. You were feeling tired. For me this time would be sitting in my english class learning about Shakespeare. I felt as if the time were never ending in that class. Students all around me had the same facial expression on them. Facial expressions are a huge key of communication. When you are out in public you see many faces around, and you can easily assume their emotions and what they are feeling. With technology being a huge factor in tody's society, we can now use it to determine someone's emotion. I believe that using technology to read emotional expressions on students could really bring forth value in classrooms.

Students all over the school have different things going on. They show and deplict off different emotions at an instant. Sometimes these emotions make it hard for students to concentrate in class during instructions or new lessons given by the teachers. Referring back to the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto, the writer, writes about a new software called the Facial Action Coding System. The new sytem was developed to determine the accuracy of emotions of people around us. If this software were to be implemented in our school, then this could be an advantage in shaping a better society. The software will help teachers determine the emotions students are feeling at the time of lecture. D'Alto quotes Dr. Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, predicting that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Once recognizing the emotions of the student, Dr. Huang continues predicting that the software can ""Then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This will help better the student's understanding in a certain subject without feeling sidetracked or confused with the activites of the teacher.

Although many may argue that the use of this software may bring negative impacts, many like the high cost of implementing it to a public school for everyone to use, or what if the software doesn't work? I could reply by stating that students struggle daily in trying to understand a certain subject in school, this leads them to fail classes or simply drop out of high school. Developing this new software will help students understand their lessons in school and stay focused. The software will also help counselors and teachers determine the emotions of their students. Sadly, many high schoolers have committed suicide because people don't understand what they are feeling, implementing this software to schools will help reduce the rate of suicides and drop outs. In paragraph four of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the writer states ""By weighting the different units, the software can even indentify mixed emotions."" This could help people to better understand each other.

In conclusion, technology has greatly impacted our society and future generations. Things all over us are changing, some changes are good and most may even bring forth new ideas, many like this new software. Placing this new software in schools will help keep them out of confusion with their emotions and education. By the use of this software, students will no longer be falling asleep because the software will help the students concentrate better by adjusting to the abilities of the student to learn. The new system will also help decrease the rate of suicide and drop outs in schools. Implementing new technology will only help make our future better. If we have the chance in changing the world and societies for the better, why not start by understanding each other and our emotions?    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

E2687856AA7D,"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, guys! Today we're talking about this thing where some schools are thinking about letting students graduate in three years instead of four. Like, I know it might seem cool to get out of school early and start your life, but honestly, I think it's a bad idea.

So, first of all, think about how much stress it would be on students. I mean, we're already trying to balance schoolwork, sports, and hanging out with friends. If we had to cram all that into three years instead of four, it would be crazy! We wouldn't have enough time to do anything, let alone relax and have fun. And let's be real, who wants to be stressed out all the time? Not me, that's for sure!

And then there's the fact that we wouldn't have time for elective classes. Like, I really want to learn how to play the guitar, but we only have like, an hour a week to do it. If we graduated early, we wouldn't have that extra time to explore our interests and figure out what we really want to do with our lives. It's important to have time to explore and try new things, you know?

And what about college preparation? I mean, we're supposed to be getting ready for college, but if we graduate early, we'd have less time to take the SATs, apply to colleges, and all that stuff. It would be super stressful and confusing, and I don't think we'd be as prepared as we need to be.

So, yeah, I think it's better to stick with the traditional four-year graduation plan. It might be longer, but it's worth it in the end. We get more time to relax, explore our interests, and prepare for college. Plus, it's just more fun that way!

That's my opinion, anyway. What do you guys think? Do you think three-year graduation is a good idea, or do you think we should stick with the traditional plan? Let me know in the comments! 😃",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

B8EE6B6594BD,"High school students often look forward to summer vacation as a time to take a break from their heavy workloads and enjoy some well-deserved rest and relaxation. The length of summer vacation for high school students has been debated for some time. Proponents of a longer summer break argue that students need the additional time to rest and recuperate from the demands of the academic year. On the other hand, proponents of a shorter summer break argue that students need more time in the classroom to keep up their educational progress. 

Weighing both sides of the debate, there is a strong argument to be made for changing the length of summer vacation for high school students. A shorter summer break would give students the opportunity to learn more in the classroom and avoid the learning gap that often takes place over long school holidays. A longer summer break, however, would give students more time to relax and relieve any stress from the year. Additionally, longer summer holidays could also give students the opportunity to do more exploring, such as taking abroad trips to enrich their knowledge and learn more about the world.

Ultimately, it is important to consider how changing the length of summer vacation for high school students could benefit them and their educational progress. With a shorter summer break, students could build on their academic knowledge and fill in any potential gaps they might have. On the other hand, with a longer summer break students could relax and take the time to explore their interests with the added benefit of refreshing their minds and bodies for the upcoming school year.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

Many companies and organizations have started to provide support to students in various ways, including job training, internships, and mentorship programs. Additionally, some professions have started to encourage student involvement and participation. However, despite these efforts, students still face challenges when trying to join a profession. In this essay, we will analyze the current state of local companies and organizations relating to their interactions with students from different schools, explore situations where employers provide support to students, examine the types of professions where student involvement is encouraged, investigate any possible issues students face when attempting to join a profession, and suggest solutions to make the experience better.

One of the most significant ways that local companies and organizations support students is through job training and internships. Many companies offer these opportunities to high school and college students to gain practical experience in their field of interest. For example, a local tech company may offer an internship program for students interested in software development or data analysis. These programs provide students with valuable skills and experience that can help them stand out in the job market. Additionally, internships can also help students make professional connections that can be beneficial later in their career.

Another way that local companies and organizations support students is through mentorship programs. These programs pair students with experienced professionals in their field of interest. Mentors can provide guidance, advice, and support to help students navigate the challenges of entering the workforce. For example, a local law firm may have a mentorship program where law students can work with experienced attorneys to gain insight into the legal profession.

Some professions have started to encourage student involvement and participation. For example, many engineering and science companies have started to partner with local schools to promote STEM education. These partnerships can take many forms, including guest lectures, field trips, and robotics competitions. By involving students in these programs, companies can help to inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists.

Despite these efforts, students still face challenges when trying to join a profession. One of the most significant challenges is the lack of diversity in the workforce. Many companies and organizations still have a long way to go in terms of promoting diversity and inclusion. This can make it difficult for students from underrepresented groups to find opportunities in their field of interest. To address this issue, companies",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0

Some people believe that stricter gun control laws are necessary to reduce the number of gun-related deaths and crimes, while others think that gun control laws only disarm law-abiding citizens and do not prevent criminals from obtaining firearms. In my opinion, I am against stricter gun control laws because they violate the Second Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees citizens the right to bear arms.

Firstly, stricter gun control laws would only disarm law-abiding citizens, which would leave them defenseless against criminals who do not follow the law. Criminals do not care about the law and will obtain firearms no matter what laws are in place. Therefore, strict gun control laws only hurt law-abiding citizens who want to protect themselves and their families.

Secondly, stricter gun control laws would not reduce the number of gun-related deaths and crimes. Criminals are going to obtain firearms regardless of the laws in place. For example, in the city of Chicago, which has some of the strictest gun control laws in the United States, there are still high rates of gun-related deaths and crimes. Therefore, stricter gun control laws would not solve the problem.

Lastly, the Second Amendment guarantees citizens the right to bear arms. Gun control laws violate this right, which is a fundamental right in a free society. The government should not be allowed to take away a citizen's right to bear arms.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws do not solve the problem of gun-related deaths and crimes. They only disarm law-abiding citizens and violate their constitutional rights. Gun control laws will not prevent criminals from obtaining firearms, and citizens have the right to bear arms for their own protection.

568EF23DE225,"The more people you ask the more it will help you as a person. When getting advice, I believe the more opinions you get the better. It is good to ask many people because, you can get better advice, you can also get different points of view, and you can decide on what the best decision is. I agree with asking multiple people for advice because, it only benefits you, and there are almost no cons. When you are in need, and desperate for help, asking many people for advice is the best thing to do.

The more people you ask for advice, the better answers you will get, and you will be able choose what's best for you. It is good to get the best advice you can because, it will help you and the situation you're in. Once you know who gives the best advice, if you have a problem down the road, then you can ask that same person for advice. When you get good advice, you will be able to adapt to those kind of situations, and you will know what to do in future situations. It is definantly worth it to just ask a few more people of their opinion.

When you are asking many people for advice you are guaranteed to get different points of view. When you get different points of view, you will be able to look at your situation in a different way. When you see things from a different point of view you will be able to see what is happening on your side of the situation, and the other side of the situation. When you can see all sides of the situation you may realize that some people have it worse than you do, and you should be grateful for what you have. When someone gives you a different way to look at things, it can really change who you are as a person.

When you ask many people for advice and you know what is best, and how to look at the situation, you will come to realize what the best decision is to make in your circumstances. Although what you may have to do is hard, it will help you in the long run. By making only one decision, it could lead you to success in the future. Once you have been able to figure out what decision is best, eventually you will be a good decision maker and may not need advice from others. Make sure when everything is going through your head, that you believe the decision you made was best.

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice can help you tremendously. Not only will it help you in the present, but it will also help you in the future. Just asking a few more people will help you get better advice, teach you how to look at things with a different point of view, and to become a good decision maker. It will help you and lead to success in many ways you dont expect. Asking those few extra people for their opinion is so worth it.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

For instance, fiction has been linked to improved empathy, while non-fiction can expand our knowledge base and critical thinking skills. Participating in a book club can further increase these benefits by providing a community for discussion and diversifying our reading list.

878EF77AEFED,"Students will definitely perform and benefit better if they attend school at home. One reason,is that the students will get to concentrate better. It would also give students more time to sleep in and wake up less tired. lastly, students getting along with teacher and students.

Students being able to concentrate better at home than being at school is more assuring for their grade and learning. At school you are more likely to talk and be distracted by other students in the class, which can effect your learning capabilities. Learning in a class can be distracting sometimes when they are 30 plus students, cause of that the teacher not always able to answer your question when you need help. Teacher not being able to answer your questions results to you not understanding the material needed for the class. Learning at home is a better concentration zone for your learning environment

Getting more sleep for kids to wake up feeling refreshed is essential for their working abilities. Waking up so early for students can be hard, to the point some students start having attendance issues. Not going to school makes them not to learn and slack off at school. With other students they can't focus, because they are so tired that they zone out and not listen to the teachers lesson. Students being able to wake up later to do their school work online can improve their attitude and waking up issues. Kids being able to wake up at a later time to do work improves their grade and work rate.

A common problem schools have is that students tend not to like all the teachers they have. With some students they have a tendency to not do their work assigned. At times teachers have a habit of treating other different, so not everyone gets the right treatment. Student being able to do their own work they don't gotta worry who they get along, which leads to getting good grades and staying on task.

I believe doing school work at home benefits students in a positive way that helps them grow as a student. Also, making their learning life more easy but efficient as the same time. Their learning abilities improve as there isn't anything that can distract or make you feel inferior to everyone else.     ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
1006FE578078,"Making extracurricular activities mandatory for students is not a valid rule that should be enforced. I don't agree that all students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity, because whether students graduate or not shouldn't be determined by an extracurricular activity that they may or may not have done,and most of the students already do an out of school activity,and students shouldn't be forced to do something that they dont want to do.

So what, they didn't participate in an extracurricular activity, that shouldn't be a barrier for them to graduate. Just because they didn't take part in the chess club, or the yearbook committee doesn't mean that they should be held back. Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do. Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things. The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits. It does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter, if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity.

What if you dont have time? Most students already do an after school activity like sports, or a youth group. Some students even do multiple sports and still balance that with school. So for them to try and balance their after school activities, school, and now an extracurricular activity, it would be chaos. Students already go through enough stress with peer pressure, and their grades, and maybe just problems at home, so they shouldn't have to worry about this too. For example, maybe some students want to get a scholarship through playing a sport,and maybe their really good and actually have a chance at getting one. If you enforce that rule they would have to focus less on their sport and more on the extracurricular activity. So students who already do after school activities dont really have time for an extracurricular activity.

What if you just don't want to? Some students have trouble socializing with others. So maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too. Some students also enjoy their free time, time where they can do homework, be on their electronic devices, or just take a nap. So they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time. Students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something. I mean it is called extracurricular activity for a reason, because it's for extra credit, so it shouldn't be a mandatory thing that they have to do.

Students graduating shouldn't be decided by if they did an extracurricular activity or not,and the students who already do after school activities don't have time for for extracurricular things,and students should not have to be pressured to do something if its not mandatory, so I don't agree that students should have to take part in an extracurricular activity.

60EE17BD75C0,"Driverless cars is a big step in the future. It could have many positive effects on society. The car would save time and money for people every where. I am for the development of these unique cars. It will change the world.

The development of driverless cars could potentially benefit the average persons' daily life. For example,texting while driving. To illustrate my point texting while driving has caused many deaths in the past. Driverless cars could drastically change that by allowing the driver text as it continues driving itself. The ""The Traffic Jam Assistant"" is good with going faster,breaking,and steering. Special sensors are used to alert the driver when certain situations come about. That is when the driver will have control. Driverless cars also has a better response and control than humans alone. According to the text it states how the Dubbed LIDAR uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. This input is important for the car to imitate a human's skill at the wheel. Driving would be very easy.

Driveless cars is a big step in the future. There will be many benefits if peoplewould consider using these fascinating vehicles. Not only it is a safety feature,but it saves time and possibly money. It can affect the society in many ways and possibly change the world today. That is why I am for the development of driverless cars.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
BC6247EE1E48,"In my personal opinion, driverless cars should not be developed due to the serious situations of computer failure, driver alertness, and legal conflicts. Each of these factors can have significant effects, from wrecks to law suits. Completely driverless cars may be a problem if these issues aren't addressed or taken into full consideration.

Computer systems on driverless cars seem to be complex and sophisticated in comparison to modern-day cars. This can be a positive, but it can also pose as a threat. If the computer system breaks down, the driver may not have time to react. How will the driver have the ability to take control in a broke down, completely driverless car? This is especially true if the driver has taken advantage of the relaxation involved with these cars and falls asleep. The driver may not even be aware that the system has failed. Plus, the complicated set up would make it an expensive, difficult system to repair.

Alertness is the most important element of driving, as described in the article. Yet, driverless cars would eliminate some of that awareness through entertainment systems. Yes, the in-car system's ability to shut off in case of an emergency is ingenious, but the driver won't be immediately prepared to take over in some cases. In addition. it's important for the driver to be on the look out for hidden patches of ice and other weather-related conditions that the driverless cars may not sense. Another example includes road construction. These instances require much care and caution, and a driver must know what's going on in order to reverse any mistakes the car wants to perform.

If an accident were to occur, the article mentions legal disputes: ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" Through my eyes, that is a controversial problem to solve. Would the driver be accused of just not paying attention? Would the manufacturer be sued for a programming mistake? It can lean both ways; the driver could've been too distracted (but that's what the entertainment systems are for) or the manufacturers were inept for the task of building such a complex car. This is a debatable topic, and I don't believe it would be worth the time and money to come to a resolution.

In conclusion, driverless cars can still be a danger despite all the sensors. What it boils down to is driver awareness, which cannot always be helped. Instead of making even more drivers unalert with entertainment systems, we should concentrate on teaching drivers to be aware of their surroundings in all situations. Not everything can be solved through a technologically-advanced smart car, but many problems can be avoided if there is a driver operating in full control.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
B28B37BFCC03,"Dear Principal,

The students should be required perform community. This is because, the students will need to know about their community and what goes on. This is also because, helping the community is important, it helps them deal with real-world problems, and help develop skills for them. It they are the future, they need to have experiences outside of the school. They should help, so they can be the leaders of the future.

For example, doing community service by baby sitting, they will have experiences on taking care of their own child or children when they have them. With experiences at a young age, they will have known what it is like to take care of they child.

Another example is if the student(s) do community service at a recycling factory, they learn about what is going on in the world and what is the amount of waste humans produce in their country or other counties. Which in turn will lead them to recycle more, which helps the environment and the animals who live there. The student could also have relatives at another country which the can tell them about the amount of waste produced there and what could happen to the world if they don't. Which leads to more recycling, and that helps the world.

And for those who believe that community service is a waste of their time, they don't think about others, they think only for themselves. And that can lead to a life of crime, with selfish desires for what others have.

For example, that person could want a necklace that another wants and they ask and the person says no, that person can feel negative desires for that person. That could lead to stealing the item itself, murdering the person and/or their family members, and/or robbing the store where the person got it from because they cannot afford the item.

The reason people should have to perform community service are listed above. And also, this could lead to a terrible community in the future. And nobody would want that. They would want a tight community. And what a tight community needs is community service done.

falcon_180b_v1_850,"There is no doubt that a growing number of people are advocating for the reduction of meat consumption due to environmental and health concerns. However, the question arises: Is it really necessary to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet? In my opinion, I believe that we should adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet because it is not only beneficial for our health but also for the environment.

Firstly, reducing or eliminating meat in our diet can significantly improve our health. Research shows that a plant-based diet can lower the risk of heart disease, obesity, and certain types of cancer. Plant-based diets are also rich in essential nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which help keep our bodies healthy.

Secondly, the production of meat is a significant contributor to environmental degradation. According to the United Nations, animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions, contributing more to climate change than all forms of transportation combined. Animal agriculture also uses vast amounts of land, water, and other resources, leading to deforestation and water scarcity.

Thirdly, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can help reduce animal cruelty. The way animals are raised and slaughtered in the meat industry is often inhumane and cruel. By eliminating meat from our diets, we are also reducing the demand for these cruel practices.

In conclusion, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is the right choice for both our health and the environment. With the numerous benefits that come with a plant-based diet, including improved health and reduced environmental impact, it is clear that we should all consider reducing or eliminating meat in our diets. It might not be easy at first, but the long-term benefits are worth it. So, let's all make a conscious effort to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet and make a positive change for ourselves and the planet.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"There is a growing movement advocating for the reduction of meat consumption due to environmental and health concerns.

21C84DF6129A,"Imagine going up to a friend and asking, ""What should I do?"", then they give you all the wrong answers? This is exactly why seeking multiple opinions is a great way to go. When you are seeking advice, and you look for multiple opinions you can get unbiased opinions, because you have more than one piece of advice. You can also have more advice to choose from, so you really can find the piece of advice that you like the most. The more advice you get, the better your decision is, because you can look at all the opinions and put them together to create an even better solution to the problem.

When seeking advice, sometimes you may get biased opinions. You may find someone who already feels a certain way about something and does not care about what happens to you. When getting advice you may run into things like this. If you get multiple opinions on a subject, you will almost never get all biased opinions. If you just get one opinion and it is biased, then you may put yourself in a bad situation, because you took that piece of advice, not knowing that that advice was biased and would put you in that situation. Making the better choice is what is important. Getting a biased or bad opinion just goes against making the right decision. If you get multiple opinions, and one of them is biased, but you listen to all the other ones, you can tell which one is biased and not make that bad decision. So getting multiple opinions helps you make the right decisions.

If you need good advice but you just want advice that is right for you, seeking multiple opinions is always better. This is because you have more advice to choose from. When getting advice from one person, you may get advice that you like but does not fit with who you are. This is because with only one piece of advice to choose from, because you can't think of your own, you have a small choice that you may not like, but you just do because you did not know what else to do. When getting multiple opinions, you have more advice to choose from so you can always choose the best advice for you and all the other people involved in the situation. With having more decisions to choose from, the decision making can be hard, but with all these choices you can have conversations with people to decide what the true best choice is. If you get multiple decisions, you can get advice that helps you more, therefore making the better decision.

When seeking advice to make a good decision, the more advice you get the better your decision is. With more opinions, you have better solutions. The goal is to try to make the right decision. With only one piece of advice it is awfully difficult to make the right decisions, and even if you do, it would not be as good as a decision made with multiple pieces of advice. This is due to the fact that with a lot of good information you can put it together and take the good parts from a the different pieces of advice and information and combine them into an even better solution to the problem. With one piece of advice, it is impossible to do that. Getting a second opinion is always a very smart decision, especially when you have to make a hard decision, that requires a lot of thinking.

In conclusion, I have shown some reasons out of many that show that getting multiple decisions is always the smart thing to do. Some reasons include that when just getting one opinion it may be a biased or bad piece of advice. Another reason is that when getting more advice you have more pieces of advice to choose from, making the decision better for yourself and the people around you. Finally, having more advice, the better the decision becomes, which is what the goal is, to make the best choice. Getting multiple opinions on a subject is the best way to go, because you will almost always make a better decision than when you did not get multiple pieces of advice.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
7CFABEFA5DFA,"I have recently read an article by the name of ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨, and asked my opinion.

I believe they could be very dangerous, they´re many sensors and techology to do with the car, who is to say they couldn´t malfunction, or intercept waves a sentence from paragraph 4 indicates my fear,¨For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors....Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, rotatin sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors....¨ and much more.

I also believe the driverless cars could put the country in even more debt.

In paragraph six they state that¨Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars.¨

The last time I herd the United States was eight trillion dollars in debt, should we really consider adding two hundred million per radar to that eight trillion?

I also would like to go back to the subject of malfuctioning.

If a driverless car malfunction, the company could possibly and most likely be sewed, we would have even more money added to that debt to try to prevent it from happening again and no one really knows spending all that money would even prevent it from malfunctioning again, and lastly we would have some very unhappy customers on our hands.

We could be talking riots, people wanting their money back, shootings, killing.

So many unanswered possibilites could go wrong with this idea and production of ¨driverless cars¨.

I strongly believe that we all shouldn't have to do community service.

I believe this because it should be whoever wants to do it not you have to do it.

As much as it will keep kids out of trouble but will also take away kids after school activities.

I play baseball and basketball and i wouldn't want community service interfering with my sports.

Now the kids that don't have after school activities are the kids that should be doing the community service because it will keep them out of trouble.

An even better idea is to make it mandatory for the kids that do noting after school because those are the kids that end up getting in trouble a lot.

Our school does not have a lot of trouble makers but if you don't start making things mandatory for the kids that do nothing after school besides hangout at the bike shop they will all become trouble makers.

Also the kids that you know that are always getting in trouble on the weekends with the cops they should have the community service if anyone.

If a kid is getting in trouble a lot and then another kid is inisint and has done nothing at all he shouldn't be the one doing community service.

So we leave this decision up to you to decide but i strongly believe we all shouldn't have to do community service.

B4994C771190," In today's digital age, the ability to attend classes from home has become increasingly popular. While some students may benefit from this flexibility, I believe that there are several reasons why attending classes on campus is still the best option for most students.

First, having a physical presence in the classroom allows for better interaction with teachers and classmates. Teachers can provide immediate feedback and answer questions in real-time, which can be especially helpful for students who struggle with certain concepts. Additionally, class discussions and group projects can be more engaging and productive when everyone is in the same room.

Second, attending classes on campus can provide a sense of community and belonging. Students can interact with their peers and form lasting friendships, which can be especially important for those who may feel isolated or lonely at home. Furthermore, being surrounded by other students can provide a sense of motivation and accountability, which can help students stay on track and achieve their academic goals.

Third, attending classes on campus can provide students with valuable experiences that they may not be able to replicate at home. For example, participating in extracurricular activities such as sports or clubs can help students develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and time management. Additionally, attending school events such as concerts or plays can provide students with a sense of excitement and engagement that they may not experience if they are only attending classes from home.

Finally, attending classes on campus can provide students with a sense of structure and routine. Going to school every day can help students develop important habits such as waking up early, attending classes regularly, and completing assignments on time. This structure can be especially helpful for students who may struggle with procrastination or time management.

In conclusion, while attending classes from home may provide some convenience, I believe that attending classes on campus is still the best option for most students. The benefits of interacting with teachers and classmates, forming a sense of community, gaining valuable experiences, and developing important habits make attending school in person an invaluable experience that students should not miss out on.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

25D0D32B0AFC,"Venus is a interesting but amazing planet. It has a nickname of the ""Evening Star"". It is the planet that is the closest related to earth, which makes sense for it also being referred to as Earth's ""twin."" It being so closely related to our home planet has caught the eye of some. It is a planet no one can get close to however some think it is worth some risks to discover what lies there. You may be thinking what risks are there? Well there are quite a few. The author does a great job explaining what the risks are and how harsh Venus can be. However I do not believe they explained enough of the benefits that support why we should explore it despite the risk factor involved.

For Venus being Earth's ""twin"" it's very different from earth. The author included the facts of the atmosphere of Venus is made up of almost ninty-seven percent of carbon dioxide and it's clouds have highly corrosive sulferic acid in them. Earth does not have either of those and humans breathe oxygen and in return produces carbon dioxide. Humans really couldn't benefit from the lack of oxygen compared to the almost ninty-seven percent carbon dioxide. The almost other three percent may not even be oxygen but the author doesn't include that detail. Earth doesn't have an average of over 800 degress on its surface unlike Venus. The author then included that the pressure is 90 times greater on Venus then it is on Earth, that pressure can crush a submarine.

There is even more that prevent us from discovering more on Venus. The weather there can and will include erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning storms. Which is really not ideal at all for trying to explore.

NASA is working on ways to get up close with Venus. According to the passage they have been testing different electronics made of silicon carbide in chambers simulating the conditions on Venus. They discovered it could last up to three wees. Their other idea was to have scientists float above the fray. But they couldn't take rocks samples or anything by doing so. It would be a good way, but they really couldn't get the research they wanted. As well as the fact it wouldn't be easy conditions because of the radiation.

According to the author, Astromers are very interested in Venus because at one point they believe it was ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" They believe it was covered with oceans and even sustained life just like Earth does now. In current day they know that it still does have similarities to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. But is that really all worth it?

The author then says the value of returning there is indisputable. The author really included a lot more risks than benefits of returning there. The support they gave wasn't that supportive. Then would say something beneficial for example, they could actually observe from the fray but they only have limited sight of the planet. It really just adds to the negative part of the exploration. The article seemed to have more negativity than positivity. The risks drowned out the support which in turn made the author's point not as strong.             ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

When going to Venus you can give away the curiosity's that people may have on the planet. But going to Venus could be a risk factor or it can be something that we discover and put it on earth.

In the passage the author states that traviling to Veuins is going to be a challenge but is still wanting to make a pursuit to go. In paragraph five the author states that

''(NASA) has one particularly compeling idea for sending humans to study Venus''. The author states NASA to show that a very big company wants to know what is up in Venus, so it should be studieded. In paragraph eight the author states that ''Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has valued, not only because of the insights to be gained on the planet itself''. This shows that the author says taking a challnge is a good thing when you want to find something out, so take challenges. In paragrqph four the author says ''If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even disscusing further visits to its surface''. The author uses this to ask a question to have you thinking to show that even scientist are curious about the planet Venus and the readers should be to. In paragraph one the author explains what other people think about they say that Venus is a evening star so the author is saying that there are miths about Venus, so the author trys to explain that traviling to Venus will take away the curiositys so, it might be a new way to discover new things to bring back to earth to share with the world; because it can advance things. The author uses alot of questions to show what he is refering to with traviling to Venus and making the reader aprove with his oppinion. In paragraph seven he states that ''some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simbulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. This shows that NASA was conducting experiments where a computer can take such bad climate.

The author uses alot of questions to show that what they are talking about is true and they even had evidence to support there idea. They even used other researchers oppinons like NASA and other scientist to show that they are also on the authors side so should Venus be traviled?.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

D496BF3A284F,"One day you principal decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, this can range from sports to running for student council. This may sound great at first but once you analyze the situation and realize this may not be ideal for all families, you will see why this idea should be expelled right away.

To begin, the main question we should be asking is why, why are these students being told they have to participate in these activities?

Not only should we be asking why, we should be asking;

What would happen if they don't?

From family matters, money issues, transportation, to school work,, there are many reasons a student may not be able to participate in these activities.

To further explain my reasoning, all people have families, and with these families comes matters and other issues that need to be dealt with. For example, if a family member in this students' life happens to pass away, is the school going to tell this child to get over it and come do their activity? Or say these parents dont pay for some sort of child care system and they give this responsibility to the eldest child, are the schools going to punish these children because have to take care of their younger sibling? From slight examination, this doesn't look to good for the schools.

If the schools are going implement this mandatory rule, how will they make it so all kids can participate? This leads to my next statement,

Will the schools provide transportation to the students who may need it?

Speaking on personal experience it can be difficult for students to get a ride home after activities when their only source of transportation is their guardians who may be unable to pick them up for reasons such as working, inability to drive, and many reasons which would make it near impossible for the child to get home. Also it can be quite embarrassing to ask for a ride home everyday. This can also lead to another major problem, kidnapping, the schools may be unaware as to whom the child is going home with and that can lead to a serious problem and a possible lawsuit on the schools hands. Furthermore, if the school are serious about this plan then they will be responsible for making sure every child is safe and has a stable way of getting home.

To continue on the topic of schools providing, lets talk about financial issues for the students and the schools as well. Not only will the schools have to give up an exponential amount of money to provide resources fro these activities, the students will too. More often than not, the guardians of these students have to give up a good amount of money in order to participate in this activities, and often times the schools forget that not everyone has the same amount of financial stability. This can lead to the student feeling left out when their classmates have stuff they nay not be able to afford, or in other instances, bullying. In order for each student to feel included the schools will have to pay for all of the resources.

All of the previous points may sound bad, but this upcoming one should persuade you on its own. From family matters to financial issues nothing really compares to what could be happening to these young people if they are forced to do these activities. While these activities may be fun, each child has to eventually go home to complete any school work. With this gargantuan load of waking up early in the morning, attending school for eight hours each day, going to their activity, and then going home to do more school work can induce an amount of stress no one under the age of 20 should ever endure. While reading this you may be wondering about the students who voluntarily do these activities, they choose to participate in this and they can better plan out their schedule and balance their work. However if this idea is put into action these students won't have much of a choice.

When you are given a good chunk of the facts, do you really want your child to have to worry about being kidnapped, being excluded by their classmates, or endure an unnessasary amount of stress at a very young age? Do you want your child to be unable to focus in class because of the large work load that's being dumped on them? If not, it is your responsibility to tell your school districts that you don't think this is best for your child, and they should be able to live as a child.

In conclusion no child should have to worry about juggling these tasks nor should they be worried about going missing, being bullied, or any stress that can mess with their mental health or their performance on school. This is why you should say no to involuntary activities placed by the schools.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
CEE41F7526FA,"I have some reasons why I would disagree with the school board because I don't like the idea of staying more time in school. Either way it is not a good idea because the school would face alot of work with the time extended plus it's gonna be more work than ever with the school extending. And I have a lot of reasons why its a bad idea so I guess start the reading the paragraphs right now.

First extending the school day would get a lot of students mad at the school because they want to go home and do whatever they want. The students would have to stay longer in the school and some would be mad and some be happy about it. And students that are bulllies would have a bigger chance on picking on people during the extended time of school. The next day the school would most likely be getting emails from students and parents complaining about the extended school day. While other students and parents wont care and go to school like a normal day and al lot more.

Also the jobs in the school could change like the teachers job and other jobs in the school time would be extended. Some teachers would complain by the extended school day if there gonna do a extended day everyday they are gonna have to be payed more or else the school would die slowly because all teachers,staff and other jobs in the school would quit and go work somewhere else better and get paid more. If one teacher does quit their job because of the extended time he/she would most likely tell other people that the school is terrible then the school would barely get people to work there and in a couple years later probably the school would be abandoned for other people to explore to see the leftovers of the dead school.

Finally the school would change by alot than before it ever has in its couple years of existance. The school would have to face a lot of consequnces like a lot of students posting on the internet about how the school is trash,boring and now they want to go to a different school. And the teachers would complain about if they are going to teach more than ever they want to get bad even more money. And they would have to change the whole school time of the day,the bus time and the students classes time which would took a very long time to do. Either way other jobs in the school would be more difficult than ever for example janitors,staff and teachers.

Even though the school really does want to change original time to a extended time it's not the smartest idea in the world because theres gonna end up being consequnces to it and they are not going to be fun for anyone. Either way next thing you know the county that owns the school will just die because of the extended day. Because then who knows probably no one then later on wants to go the either school in the county anymore and would probably just moved out to go to a better school. So this is why this idea is a bad idea.",0,original_moth,Task: Write an essay explaining why extending the school day is not a good idea.,7

Actions Speak Louder Than Words! 💪

Have you ever met someone who seemed super cool and awesome at first, but then turned out to be totally different once you got to know them better? 🤔 Yeah, me too! 🙅‍♀️ It's like, we always judge people based on their actions and appearance, but sometimes those first impressions can be totally wrong! 😲

Like, imagine you're applying to college. You see a student who's super smart and gets straight A's, but then you find out they're also super kind and volunteers at a local animal shelter. 🐾📚 That's like, way cooler than just being a straight-A student! 😎 And you're like, ""Wow, this person is way more awesome than I thought!"" 😅

2A4221CE52DC,"The future of this world is technology, but how far can technology go? Some schools offer learning outside of the classroom by attending classes from home by going online and video conferencing. Online classes are not beneficial to students when public schooling is accessible. The environment of public school is completely different from home, the pressure in order to become better in public schools is not the same as taking classes online. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home because they would cheat, procrastinate, and not make friends easily.

Attending classes from home can easily lead to cheating. Students can cheat on assignments and exams because they have everything they need in their house in order to pass. Books and the internet can both be accessed from home without the teacher knowing the student is cheating. An exam would not show a students learning when they have the ability to access the internet to answer a question they should have learned. Although cheating is already an issue in public schooling, online classes would not lower the rate of cheating. The ability to go on the internet while no one is watching become a huge incentive to cheat. Therefore, public schools are finding ways to minimize cheating in the classroom as well. Public schooling is the best option because cheating would continue to get worse if more kids attend online classes from home.

Procrastination would become a bigger issue if students attended classes from home. Kids would not meet deadlines on time if they were to take online classes. The expectations would be lowered for students who do not turn in, or do, the work. Deadlines to assignments would be pushed back, giving students more time to do what they want to do, and papers would not represent the students capability because they rush to get it done. Having the pressure of a teacher, in person, helps motivate students to complete assignments. A teacher's physical presence helps motivate a student to do well on assignments and ask for help. Students attending classes online can not easily ask for feedback or advice on assignments from a teacher who is not in person. So, online schooling is detrimental to students because procrastination would rise.

Making friends grows difficult when taking classes from home because those students who take online classes are not attending classes with thousands of other students in a public school. Interacting with other people is how humans can gain more friends and become well-rounded. Being versatile can be beneficial in many situations like jobs that require interacting with others on a daily basis, for instance, a lawyer. A lawyer must know how to communicate and persuade the jury to agree with him. Taking online classes forces a student to become an introvert. The only communication the student would have is with the teacher through a computer. Public schools encourage students to make friends and build on experiences. Although this choice allows students to get assignments done when they are not able to attend public school, it would get the work done, but the student would not learn anything.

Public schooling is more beneficial compared to online schooling because students would cheat, procrastinate, and have difficulty making friends. Schools offering learning from a distance by allowing kids to attend classes online is detrimental to a student's success. The environment of public school is completely different from home, the pressure in order to become better in schools is not the same as classes online. Issues in public schools would only rise if students could take classes from home. In conclusion, schools should not offer online schooling from home because the impact is more negative than positive.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
DE29B1ED3EFC,"Hello there! I'm Luke. What do you want to be when you grow up? A farmer? A surgeon? How about a Seagoing Cowboy? No, it's not a job where you ride seahorses with a Cowboy hat (Although that would be awesome). Being a Seagoing Cowboy meant a lot to me, and if you are a young boy in hopes of helping those in need in this war, it is the job for you! So here are reasons why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

First of all, Seagoing Cowboys help countries ruined by WWII by taking care of horses, young cattle, and mules taken overseas to them by us. In a way, you not only help that broken country, but you are helping the U.S. When you help us help another country, they will most likely help us back, forming alliance for war purposes. So you not only help them, but us as well!

Last year in 1947, as a young boy, went on many great adventures to amazing places. Along with helping people, I also went to places like an ancient Greek acropolis, Venice, Italy to ride a gondola, and ancient China, where I excavated a ruined castle. Along with helping those in need, I also got to admire the great Parthenon, or see the Panama Canal. These places are only a small handful you get to go to as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Along with the sights, you get to travel the open ocean. If you are an ocean person, you probably want to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Traveling the sea is an amazing experience, as seing unexplored islands, the galaxy at night, and sparkling blue water is quite a life-changer. Rarely did I ever see a storm out on the Atlantic, so no worries there.

Overall, being a Seagoing Cowboy is the job of a lifetime. I remember doing all these things, and I still do them today! Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a way to forget about WWII, and see the world as a peaceful place again. With the right training, this job can help you see the beauty in this fine world. So if you want to forget about war, and help those in need, see extraordinary sights, and travel the sea, then join us! I'll sea you on the high seas!",0,persuade_corpus,,0
6C98327DA084,"Small acts of kindness can have an impact on others that goes far beyond just the doer and recipient. Kindness can be as simple as offering words of encouragement, volunteering time to help others, or even just sharing a smile with a stranger. These small acts of kindness can leave a lasting impression and brighten someone’s day. 

Research has shown that providing acts of kindness leads to higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in people. In 2009, Stephen Post, director of the Center for Medical Humanities, Compassionate Care and Bioethics at Stony Brook University, conducted a study involving 1,000 people. He found that ""acts of kindness, regardless of whether or not others notice them, significantly increase happiness"" in the people performing them. Other studies have shown that recipients of kind acts are eight times more likely to pass on that kindness to someone else than they are to pass on negative behavior, resulting in a ripple-effect of kindness that can be felt in our communities.

Having a positive mindset is key to understanding and promoting kindness, and this starts with the role that parents play. Parents must create an environment in which kindness is emphasized, and they must teach their children to be kind. This is something that requires effort and dedication; setting a good example and encouraging open discussions on how kindness can be demonstrated are great ways to foster this values in children. Additionally, research suggests that kindness is contagious and can create opportunities in people’s lives by opening doorways to positive physical and mental health benefits, improved relationships, and increased success. 

In conclusion, small acts of kindness have far-reaching impacts on both the doers and recipients, and should be encouraged. Having a positive mindset and being kind to others is an essential part of fostering a compassionate and understanding community. Kindness can create opportunities in people's lives, and parents are vital in setting an example for young generations to come.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

BF1CF7418511,"Cars arent bad....or are they? In the 1950's the U.S went though a time where Cars were everything. Our culture was about the new 1955 mustang or Camero, The new 1958 Mustang mach 1. The whole idea of cars and americans are one of the easly seen together thing like peanut butter and jelly. The thing is though cars lead to the second amount of pollutant in america right behind powerplants. This is bad for both the safety and enviroment of people, because gas emmissions lead to smog. Smog is a deadly mixture of carbon and fog, it is created when fog is settling in a city or area and then with carbon that is being released by cars they mix causing a deadly black toxic fog that can serously hurt peoples lungs when they breathe it in.

By limiting car usage, like for example the city of Vauban, Germany where city are prety much ""car-free"", you can still buy a car and have it but its pointless to do so because everything is by your house and if you need to pick up grocery or such its down the road. This makes people more happy as one women stated ""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". This lifestyle of a ""car-free"" Suburban life can reduce smog from happening in your area. Paris, France the city of love. it can also now be called the city of smog, it rivalled Beijing,China in the amount of smog in the air. Yes this was due to wethear and the combination of Diesel fuel. people of Paris found out first hand how bad smog can be for five days! It would be just a lot easier of having limiting car usage the advantages are ridoclaus, people are more happy, you dont have to worry about smog and in some countries you dont have to pay a tax or a fine of some sort. The advantages are great for many reasons they can help you out in your pocket and also with your health. Now who doesnt want to live like that?

I mean im sure there is more reasions on why limiting car usages is good for example less cars lead to car accidents, your insurance would be lower because of price and demand, better air quality, better health quality both pyshically and mentally from all the exrcising you have to do. i mean i understand the question when it said ""must be based on ideas and informantion given"" but these can also be reasons on why car free sub urban cities are good. Think about it you have a city with no pollutant and or cars are banned. There are cities like this all ready for example there is a town in Maine where the people banned all cars! People are on bikes just getting there stuff, and if you do happen go into this town with a car you are fined $320. Also when the car first came out did you know that it was a ""green solution"" to horses because horses pooped every where so it was considered more green to buy a car then a horse.

I'm just saying you should be able to bring out side information to this and i understand that you might be going this guy got a zero or what ever but lets be honest you probally didnt know that information. This information would helped give my fellow citizen a good reason why that limiting car usage is a good thing. who wants to be outside breathing in smog? When i can be riding my bike and not have to worry about A. Car insurance, B. Car accidents and C. getting into shape.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
2BAB7EB9E22A,"Dear Senator of Florida,

Though long-standing and ""fair"" to both citizens and Congress, the Electoral College is completely unnecessary and faulty. Election by popular vote is much more practical and leaves room for less errors. First off, the Electoral College warps the perception of voting, for when citizens vote, it is not directly for the president. Also, the Electoral College leaves many loopholes, which cause many issues and disputes.

To start off, the Electoral College does not allow citizens to vote directly, like a true democracy. This is unfair, unjust, outdated, and irrational. The natural right of a citizen should be to directly vote for something of a passionate matter. Controversies are everywhere, and citizens should be able to have a direct say in what is done. In

What Is the Electoral College?, the Office of the Federal Register declares, ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"" (1.6). This seems quite indirect and faulty. Can the electors be trusted? We do not know - and we definitely do not want to find out. In

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, ""...according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college - won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (2.9).

Moving on, the Electoral College also contains many loopholes in the system. It is very possible to have issues arise. Electors can become faithless, the number of electors for a certain state can be controversial, and legislatures can ""defy the will of the people."" In

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John. F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)"" (2.11). This unfortunate fact really shows how faulty the electoral college system really is. Do we really want so many loopholes when it comes to choosing the person who will run our country?

One may say that the electoral college has less disputes than that of just the popular vote. In

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president , Richard A. Posner says, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - it happened in 2000 - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote"" (3.18). However, this is untrue in my opinion. The Electoral College has already created so much controversy and dissension, along with faults and problems. For the well-being of our country, it would be best to simply get rid of the Electoral College alltogether.

Overall, the Electoral College should not exist - choosing the president should rely on simply the popular vote. The Electoral College is not a direct way for citizens to vote, which shows signs of America not being a true democracy. Also, the Electoral College has many loopholes that are sources of dispute and issues in America. To sum it up, this method of choosing the president, is irrational, unfair, unjust, and outdated. The Electoral College should be abolished.

Thank you for your time,

I think we should have cell phones for that if we forget a number and you need it you can get it. Because of the fact that we forget parents number to is a reason for having a cell phone.

That is best for us students. we need cell phones to help us not forget numbers. instead of caring a sheet of paper. you can just get your phone out and go to the contacts.

we should be able to use them when in gym,lunch,and outside. And that teachers keep there phones out and can text call or anything like that we need the same thing.

i understand that some students will get careless and just text and class. that is when it need to be taken up. because you are in class to learn not to text. but we don't learn nothing in lunch or outside. but we learn in health but not in gym playing basketball all the time.

all you do in our gym class is do your exercise and then play basketball or football.

i know it help you learn these sport but that just a class to text or call in. you should not text or talk in a library. because a library is a place of quiet and noise from your cell phone is not tolerated. why you are walking it is not good because you bump into people who might get mad at you. you should not be able to text during crct because you may run out of time and fail the test.

because without the crct you will have to retake and then if you fail you are retained.

All I'm trying to say is that students should be able to use cell phones only in places where is not learning nothing. you know what to do let us use only in none learning places.

86A39056FB93,"Giving up a car can be difficult. But if you all knew more about cars, perhaps you all would stop using them. Or at least limiting the usage of your car. Lowering the pollution rate in the world would defenetlly be an advantage. There would br more space for other things to be built. And besides, cars are a one of the many ways people die.

Cars are so mediocre for our environment. . ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" The percentage is lower in Europe due to the fact that Europeans drive less that the people in United States do. The Environmental Protection Agency are promoting ""car reduced"" communities in the United States. Beijing, China, is on eof the most polluted cities in the entire world. Many countries and cities are enforcing a partial driving ban to get rid of the air pollution. Places like France, Paris, London and even Bogota, Colombia. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlose Arturo, a businessman. Studies in  America show that as each year goes by, less and less Americansare buying or driving cars. Studies also show fewer licenses are getting distributed each year.

Driving fewer cars means that roads really aren't useful anymore. So, that leaves room for other things to be built. Things like parks, restaurants, shopping centers, and it woould be great for promoting or expanding companies. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hourrestrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

Finally, cars are one of the many ways people die. Statistics show that car crashes are more likely to happen than getting in a plane crash or any other type of collision. Especially for teens who have just got their license. Many peopole die from car crashes, just think about all the losses we could prevent from happening. Just because that person didn't mean anything to you doesn't mean they weren't loved by someone else.

In conclusion, you should see the many things we could avoid with cars. The many advantages we would have without cars. We would have less pollution, more space for other things to be built, and the lives of your loved ones. Even if you choose not to stop driving your car, at least limit the usage of it, or you coud car-pool.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Aiming High: The Key to Maximizing Success

As an 8th grader, I've learned that success doesn't come easily. It takes hard work, determination, and the willingness to take risks. Throughout history, there have been countless examples of people who have defied the odds and achieved greatness. For instance, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, was a single mother living on welfare before she became one of the wealthiest women in the world. Oprah Winfrey, a former TV host and media mogul, was fired from her first job and experienced poverty and abuse as a child. These individuals, and many more like them, prove that success is possible with the right mindset and a willingness to take risks.

However, failure is also an inevitable part of the journey to success. Everyone experiences setbacks and disappointments, but it's how we respond to them that matters. Failure can be a valuable learning experience, teaching us what doesn't work and how to improve. For example, Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" By embracing failure as a learning experience, we can use it as motivation to keep striving for success.

It's important to aim high and work towards our goals, rather than setting low expectations and potentially missing out on success. When we aim high, we're more likely to push ourselves to work harder and be more creative in our pursuit of success. For instance, if we want to get good grades in school, we're more likely to study harder and ask for help when we need it if we aim for straight A's rather than just passing. By aiming high, we're more likely to achieve our full potential and reach our goals.

In conclusion, aiming high is the best course of action in order to maximize success. By embracing failure as a learning experience and using it as motivation to strive for success, we can achieve greatness. So, set your goals high and work towards them with determ",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

llama_70b_v1463,"Meat consumption has become a controversial topic in recent years due to its impact on the environment and human health. Some people argue that reducing meat consumption is essential for a sustainable future, while others believe that it is not necessary to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet. In this essay, I will argue for adopting a vegetarian diet and present reasons and examples to justify my position.

Firstly, the production of meat, especially beef, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the livestock sector is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transport sector. The production of meat requires large amounts of land, water, and feed, which leads to deforestation, habitat loss, and water pollution. Moreover, the methane emissions from cattle are 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide, making beef consumption a significant contributor to climate change. A vegetarian diet can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow down climate change.

Secondly, a vegetarian diet is beneficial for human health. Numerous studies have shown that a plant-based diet can help prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Vegetarians tend to have lower body mass indexes, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels compared to meat-eaters. Additionally, a vegetarian diet is rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which are essential for maintaining good health.

Thirdly, adopting a vegetarian diet can help reduce the global food crisis. With the rise in population, the demand for food is increasing, and the livestock sector is struggling to keep up. The production of meat requires vast amounts of resources, and it is simply not sustainable to continue consuming meat at the current rate. A vegetarian diet requires less land, water, and resources, making it a more sustainable option.

Finally, a vegetarian diet can help reduce animal suffering. Factory farming, which is the dominant method of meat production, involves keeping animals in inhumane conditions and subjecting them to painful procedures such as castration and beak trimming. By adopting a vegetarian diet, we can reduce the demand for meat and promote more humane and ethical farming practices.

In conclusion, adopting a vegetarian diet is a sensible solution to the environmental and health concerns created by meat consumption. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve human health, reduce the global food crisis, and promote animal welfare. While some people may argue that meat is an essential part of a balanced diet, the benefits of a vegetarian diet far outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, I strongly advocate for reducing meat consumption and adopting a vegetarian diet for a sustainable future.",1,llama_70b_v1,"There is a growing movement advocating for the reduction of meat consumption due to environmental and health concerns.

CAE908DEFBB9,"The so called "" Face'' on mars is just a landform that looks like a face. I know this because there are no such thing as aliens, if aliens did exist we would have seen them and known by now, and lastly I know that I is just a landform because it looks like a coincidental landform that looks like an alien.

The first reason that I know it is a landform and not an alien is because aliens do not exist. They are some made up characters found in science fiction books and movies, just like monsters, witches, and ghosts. There has never been actual scientific evidence that proved any of those things to be real. Many crazy people think that they have encountered ghost sightings and other things like demons, zombies, or even something as dumb as slenderman. These things are all fantasies that they make up in their heads and then try to get other foolish people to believe them.

The second reason that I know that it is not an alien is that if aliens and monsters really did exist we would have all known by know. If they were anything like what they are in movies we would all be dead or abducted. In movies people see UFO's and they suddenly are sucked up into a portal and abducted by aliens and used as slaves. If they existed you would think that many people would probably have gone missing after ""UFO"" sightings. Like I said before it is just a bunch of nonsence that people have made up in their head and aren't smart enough to know that it isn't true.

My last reason that I know it isn't an alien is because I know that landforms can often look like things that they really aren't. For example at my uncles house they have a big rock in their back yard that looks a lot like a ground hog. I know that it is not a ground hog, but if I was like the people that thought it was an alien I could make up a bizare story about how in ancient times the ground hog got cursed and then was turned into a rock because the king demanded it to.

See? It just doesn't make much sence.

Sure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture, but so did the rock in my uncle's back yard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. The NASA crew said, ""Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous heaad nearly two miles for end to end seemed to be staring at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. First off, the aliens in sci-fi movies aren't nearly two miles long, not even close to that. Secondly where it says that the head seemed to be staring up at them, obviously if you are above it and it's a 2d or 3d shape it's going to appear to be looking at you!

In conclusion there is no way that the so called face on mars is an alien. It's not an alien because aliens don't exist, we would have known by now it aliens really existed, and some landforms are shaped like odd things. Like I said earlier, if aliens really existed we would have encountered them before and seen UFO's that would try to abduct us. This is why there are no such things as aliens, which means the face on mars is just a landform that just so happens to look like a face. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
AF8963C142A0,"Working in a group can have numerous benefits compared to working alone. One of the most significant advantages of group work is collaboration. When working with others, individuals can share ideas and work together to solve problems. This can lead to more creative solutions and a greater understanding of the task at hand.

Another benefit of group work is communication. When working in a group, individuals have the opportunity to communicate with others who may have different perspectives or experiences. This can lead to a greater understanding of different viewpoints and can help individuals develop their own ideas.

In addition to collaboration and communication, group work can also lead to faster work. When working in a group, individuals can divide the workload and work together to complete tasks. This can lead to faster completion times and a greater sense of accomplishment.

Finally, group work can also lead to improved understanding. When working in a group, individuals can ask questions and receive feedback from others. This can help individuals better understand the task at hand and can lead to a greater sense of mastery.

Overall, working in a group can have numerous benefits compared to working alone. These benefits include collaboration, communication, faster work, and improved understanding. By working with others, individuals can develop their ideas, learn from others, and achieve greater success.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,2
9AC32EA4050B,"Working with a group can have numerous benefits, both in terms of learning and cultural exchange. When individuals come together to work towards a common goal, they can share their unique perspectives and skills to achieve something greater than what any one person could do alone. For example, in a group project for school, each member can contribute their own area of expertise, such as research, writing, or design, to create a comprehensive and well-rounded final product.

In terms of learning, working with a group can be incredibly effective. When individuals are able to collaborate and share their knowledge, they can learn from each other and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. This is especially true when group members come from diverse backgrounds and experiences, as they can bring different viewpoints and approaches to the table. By working together, group members can challenge each other's ideas and learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses.

Working with a group can also facilitate cultural exchange between members. When individuals from different cultures come together, they can share their customs, traditions, and values with each other, promoting mutual understanding and respect. This can be especially important in today's globalized world, where cultural exchange and understanding are more important than ever.

Another benefit of working with a group is the development of communication and language skills. When individuals work together, they must learn to communicate effectively and listen to each other's perspectives. This can help to improve their language skills, as they learn to express themselves clearly and understand each other's ideas. Additionally, working with a group can help individuals to develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as they learn to work together to overcome challenges and obstacles.

Finally, working with a group can provide a sense of support and motivation. When individuals are working towards a common goal, they can encourage and motivate each other to reach their full potential. This can be especially important for students, who may feel overwhelmed or struggling with a particular assignment. By working with a group, students can feel a sense of belonging and support, which can help to boost their confidence and motivation.

I was enchanted by the complexity and range of emotion that the instrument could convey when played skillfully. As I conducted research into the instrument's history, I developed an even greater appreciation for its extraordinary heritage and the history of its renowned composers.  

I eagerly signed up for violin lessons. However, I soon realized that learning to play the violin is an incredibly taxing process that requires immense dedication, time, and focus to become proficient. You need to practice regularly in order to ensure that you can play the instrument comfortably and develop both musical and technical skills such as knowing fingering positions, posture, and having an overall command of the instrument’s sound. 

My first experiences taking violin lessons were humbling. I was surrounded by much more experienced and knowledgeable musicians, yet the teacher was patient with me and helped me gradually become more comfortable and confident with the instrument. Despite the initial difficulty, I saw firsthand the sheer joy of mastering a new piece and was inspired by those around me to push my limits and strive to get to the point of being able to perform confidently.

At the same time, I realized the detrimental consequences of not practicing regularly. Neglecting practice can lead to slipping technical ability, as well as a loss of confidence and motivation. Through this experience, my attitude and perspective on the violin shifted from a source of struggle to a place of peace and comfort. Today, I am able to take immense joy in playing the violin, something that I never imagined I would be doing.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

4EC2CCDB49DC,"Dear Principal,

I think you should go with policy 1. You never know what will come up, so it helps to have a phone with you at all times. In this world that we have now, it's never save outside. As long as they have them off during class it should be all good. But if they have them on and reading a text message or something with their phones then it would be alright for them to take their phone away. There is new technology in the world, and the cell phone is one of them. It would be hard to keep it away from a young person. Policy 2 is not that bad of an idea either but you got to think of what the students want too. Not just what the teachers and you want.

Young people are having fun with all of these new things. You have to let them try things out. It's not all about education all the time. If that was true everyone would be boring and the same. Not different and unique. Everyone has something that makes them different form everyone else and to make them special in their way. The people of America, and the rest of the world are never alike, and never will be. They may have something's in common but face it, no one is the same. You have to think, if I was young in this time period going to school, would i want my principal to be like this?

It's a never ending question. It's always how would you like it. So you have to ask yourself everyday, am I helping out the students or am I just doing this because I like my job? If you are a principal you would be here for the students not because of the money you earn from working. The reason you would work around kids is because you like them not hate them. So if you were a student and your principal was thinking of this, what would you want them to do?

So now you got two choices. Policy one or Policy two? It's your choice not mine. But I know I would pick Policy number one. It helps everyone out. It's why they made the cell phone. Think of this, is it beneficial to others or is it just a horrible idea? Are you making the world a better place by your choice about cell phones? How would this effect the students education? would they be distracted? How might you feel if you weren't able to have your phone on during work if you had someone at home who needed something? Don't just think of the education, because everyone learns everyday. Nothing will change that. You learn from your mistakes don't let this be a mistake that could have been prevented.

It helps if you ask others what they think. Ask the teachers, the students, the parents, the school board and ask your self. It don't just affect you, it affect's everyone.

Thank you for your time. I hope you will consider all your choices!",0,persuade_corpus,,4
falcon_180b_v1_281,"The digital age has brought about significant changes in the way we access and consume information. With the rise of e-books, online databases, and other digital resources, the role of traditional libraries has been a topic of debate. While some argue that libraries have become obsolete, I believe they continue to play an essential role in our communities.

To begin with, libraries provide access to a wide range of resources for people from all walks of life. Not everyone can afford to buy books or subscribe to academic journals, but libraries make these resources available for free. They also offer access to computers and the internet, which is crucial for those who do not have these resources at home. For many people, especially those in low-income communities, the library is their only means of accessing information and technology.

Furthermore, libraries serve as community hubs where people can gather, learn, and connect with others. They offer programs and activities for children, teens, and adults, such as book clubs, workshops, and author talks. These events foster a sense of community and encourage lifelong learning. Libraries also provide a safe and quiet space for students to study and do homework, away from distractions at home.

In addition, libraries play a vital role in preserving our cultural heritage. They house historical documents, rare books, and other artifacts that tell the story of our past. By preserving these materials, libraries ensure that future generations can learn from and appreciate our history.

While it is true that many resources are now available online, not all information on the internet is reliable or accurate. Libraries provide access to credible sources and trained professionals who can help people navigate the vast amount of information available. Librarians are skilled at helping patrons find the information they need, whether it be for research or personal interest.

In conclusion, while the digital age has brought about changes in the way we access information, libraries continue to play an essential role in our communities. They provide access to resources, serve as community hubs, preserve our cultural heritage, and offer guidance in navigating the vast amount of information available. Therefore, we must continue to support and invest in our libraries to ensure that they remain a valuable resource for years to come.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"The role of libraries in the digital age has been a topic of discussion.

7EA9C3EDA163,"While many students would at first believe that distanced learning is better, most parents would actually agree that a learning environment with real students and teachers is more beneficial. With the exception of special cases (like medical reasons that may prevent a student from attending a school campus) having human interaction is critical for a true learning environment. For example from personal experience most interactions I've had with other kids my age who partake in distanced learning or go to private schools have been awkward, rude, and for lack of a better word weird.

The idea of being able to learn from the comfort of your home everyday can definitely be enticing to students. Not having to wake up early, go outside, and being able to use your computer all day! That all sounds really nice at first. But students won't be able to realize what they will lose until it's gone and too late to have back. As humans we need physical interaction to live, humans are very social creatures and most of the friends kids have come from school. Having that social experience everyday builds character and prepares students for the real world, it's one of the few and most important things kids will learn and use for the rest of their lives and most of them don't even know it.

In conclusion while many students would at first believe that distanced learning is better, it could potentially be more harmful to their development later in life. Social interaction in schools isn't just fun but is important practice for the real world and teaches students the invaluable lesson of respectful communication. Smooth and respectful communication is imperative to accomplishing most things in life because no one can get anywhere in life on knowledge alone. Getting a job, loan, or any kind or relationship would be impossible without respect, admiration, and of course people liking you all things that can only come from knowing how to socialize with others and having that experience. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
1C6B45AF8116,"WHY I THINK STUDENTS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE

yes I think students should be required to community service because if they do they would be helping the community a lot and it could teach people how to start caring more about there community and probably do some community service there self.

students can make a difference in there community they just need somebody to show them how to do it.

another reason why i think students should be required to do community service is for bad behavior or vandalize school property and so they can learn that things like that won't help get the community better it will just make it worse.

another reason is that it would help the men and women who have to clean and pick up trash every day.

if we don't recycle and pick up trash it will make the community worse to and if you have a bad community then you have a bad city a bad county and a bad state and a bad environment so it would help if students would take some time out and volunteer to do community service to help the planet.",0,persuade_corpus,,0

It's different, it could possibly help students, and it can change a direction in school period.

As a student its easy to get bored in class, even when we're on our computers, as stated in paragraph 6, ""..if you smile when a web ad appears on screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" That doesn't only help at school but anywhere, because we hate ads, also stated in paragraph 6, Dr. Huange says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This is can be a big time help to students in school.

Another way this can help students is by possibly making them get to know new friends. If two or more students found alot of things in common they thought no one else would, or they never expected that person to like the same thing they like, it could possibly make new and unlikely friendships.

Propponents may say people can easily put on false emotions, such as a ""false smile"" but in paragraph 8 it states, ""..muscles called obricularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscel clues are sometimes used to spot a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity [that] isn't being truthful.""

Some students may be happy and excited about school while others are bored and drowsy. New technology has been developed called the Facial Action Coding System. This system enables computers to indentify human emotions. This technology would be very benefiticial to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

With this new tech teachers would have the ability to read there students emotional expressions when they are giving a lesson. If the students emotional responses are boredom and drowsiness. Then the teacher will know they should change what they are doing so the students become more alert and interested.""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. If a student is becoming lost or dosent understand the material the computer will recognize that and the teacher will be able to stop and help that student.

The use of this tech will allow teaching in the classroom to become more efficent and if a student is struggling teachers will be able to recognize that quicker. This system will not only help with teaching but can also help emotionally. If a student is sad and going through some difficult things the computer can recognize this by the students facial expressions. The teacher then can talk to the sutdent and maybe cheer them up.

This technology can also help with school safety. Recently there have been alot of school shootings and threats. If a student has a look on their face that shows anger,sadness,intent,or rage. The computer will recognize this and the teacher may be able to prevent anything bad from happening to that student or other people in general.

In conclusion the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable in many different ways. It can make teaching more efficent. It can help teachers identify students who are lost or confused. It can recognize when a student is sad,mad,or angry therefore allowing the teacher the opportunity to speak with that student and see if they are ok.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

Have you ever considered joining an after school club? How about a sport? Or maybe even student council? There are many different activities to choose from that all have unique benefits. Participating in an extracurricular activity would be very beneficial because most colleges like when you have school related activities, they give you something to do, and it's an opportunity to make new friends.

When completing a college application, they'll want to know more about you. One way to show them that you're well rounded is joining clubs. It displays that you have a variety of interests. As a result, the probability of you being accepted into a certain college is increased. The more activities the better.

Not only are extracurriculars beneficial for college, but they also give you something to do. Would you rather be sitting in your bedroom and staring at the wall or learning new skills and having fun? If you're more interested in the arts, then you could join theater or drama club. If you prefer being active and competitive, then you could join a sport. No matter what you decide on, you'll enjoy yourself and learn simultaneously.

Extracurriculars are an excellent opportunity to create new friendships and learn more communication skills. Everyone has one common interest and that brings people together. Finding a friend or two is very likely. By making new friends, your communication skills will certainly improve.

D95B78E39793," In today's world, individuals have their own opinions and make their own decisions. However, this has led to a significant shift in the way people approach decision-making. People are now more intelligent and make wise decisions on a daily basis. However, they often take risks without consulting experts or authorities.

It is crucial for individuals to seek guidance from experts and authorities when making significant decisions. This will make it easier for them to choose the best options, as they will have someone who already knows about it. People often make wrong decisions when they make decisions on their own. Celebrities, for example, have personal managers who make thoughtful decisions for them to keep them on track with their careers. If celebrities were to make their own decisions, many of them would likely fail in their careers.

The decisions people make should be thoughtful and well-informed. Seeking guidance from experts is essential to ensure that the decisions made are the best possible ones. For instance, Christopher from Into the Wild is a prime example of the dangers of not seeking advice. He went into the wilderness of Alaska alone without any guidance or preparation, which ultimately led to his death. If he had sought advice from experts, he would have had a better chance of survival.

People who seek advice from experts and authorities are more likely to have a successful life. While there are some individuals who have achieved success in their careers by making their own decisions, most people need guidance from experts to keep them on track.

Student would be more efficient in order to accomplish what the project should be and what the project should actually look like to the teacher.

However to some students it may be better to design a project based off of how they would want the project to look and how they want their project setup instead of what teacher would want. This would give the teacher the opportunity to see what the student is capable of doing on their own. This option would represent what the students have actually learned over their break. It also will reflect how the students take it upon themselves to show what they know in a creative way based off of the projects topic.

However, student-designed projects would lead to some students not putting as much effort and creativity in their projects. Students will do the bare-minimum when they have the option to take it upon themselves to do an assignment for school. Some students may take it upon themselves to go above and beyond for their student-designed project. However some students may take advantage and use it as an opportunity to be lazy and unproductive on this assignment.

Students would not have as much motivation if they have the option to take it upon themselves to create a project over their summer break. If this assignment was left up to students to design their own projects some would not take it as serious as should and some would. The students who won't take it as serious as they should would have an unorganized project or they just wouldn't do the project at all.

A benefit of summer projects being teacher-designed would be the fact that all students had one layout or structure for how their projects are supposed to be. It would be easier for the teachers to grade and look over all projects efficiently. It would also be easier for the students to follow an assigned rubric or setup for a project.

With the electoral college system voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. The problem with this is that when the electors go to vote for the presient, who are the electors? They could be anybody, so how would we know if our president that got choose had it fairly? Well, we dont. Instead of having the electoral college system we should change it to the popular vote of the people. By doing so, we can know that the president that got choose had it fair with all the other presidents that decided to run for the position to. Instead of when voting it being called a natural disaster which is what is known for as the electoral college we can know we voted fair by voting with the election by popular vote.

The people in the community should have the right in this because of the fact that , each and everyday we are going to have to live by the rules of the president, so we should have the right to vote for the president, and the outcome for whoever wins would be fair because thats who most the people think should run our country. At the basic level, the electoral college is unfair to the voters.

243ED18B29C0,"Dear principal,

I would like to comment on your recent school policy that stated that students must have at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities. I believe that this policy will help higher the amount of B average students because many people do enjoy playing a sport or another activity. Students go above and beyond their usual school habits and they will have to study hard and work to get the B average. There are some students that even though they try their hardest, they will not be able to get the B average because of their inability to work at a high level. If this is the case, then the school must provide extra help classes and study sessions with the teachers to make sure that the kids have the opportunity to play for a sports team or participate in any other school activities. If this policy were to go into effect today, then you would see a huge spike in student's grade point average.

My first reason is what I believe that will come into effect immediately. If students really want to participate in extra curricular activities, then the will try even harder then they were before. There are students that would go the extra mile to be on a sports team or join other activities. These students will seek additional help if they do not believe they can maintain B averages. On the downside, there will be a few students who will not want to work to get the B average and they will not participate in sports or other activities. This could cause the sports teams to become less talented then they were before because some of the talent might not care enough to try and get the B average. But, if you would like your students to try and work more efficently and coopretively, then this policy could be the right the thing to enforce in the school.

For my second reason, there will be kids that are not capable of getting a B average. It may be because they are not very good test takers or their study habits are very poor. Some might not be able to concentrate and they get distracted very easily. It would be unfair for these students because of their inability to maintain the B average. The school would be responsible for not letting these kids participate in sports and other activities; therefore, in order to give them a better chance at getting the B average, the school should provide tutoring and extra help sessions for the kids who really need the help. The teachers could give them verbal quizzes on what they are learning if they are not very good test takers. They could give them homework that they might better understand and also provide them with extra credit opportunites. The sports teams may despretley need a kid that is very athletic, but not very smart and if this policy were to go into effect, then the school must provide the additional help.

In conclusion, I believe that this is a very fair and reasonable policy. It will force kids to work out to their full potential, and they will have better grade point averages. The students must fully accept their responsibilty to live up to this potential so that the students, faculty, and coaches will be satisfied with the students.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
760272F05BCE,"Now a days you see everyone with cars driving to places instead of walking. There are some small towns that cars are not needed because everything is so close but other cities everyone has to drive because everything is very distant from one another. Cars are needed on a daily basis to get to school, or to get to their job but walking or even biking would be a great idea because you would not be poluting the environment there would be less traffic jams and it would reduce the greenhouse gas. Limiting car usage would be a great idea and it would make peoples life a lot better and healthier because instead of driving they would walk to take a bike.

Polution is a big problem especially in big cities because everyone is driving and the smoke the cars leave makes our environment gross. Polution is not only because of the smoke the cars produce, it can also be when someone throws plastic into the oceans and poluting the waters or having trash in parks without recycling. I think we should re-enforce the recycling systems because many people dont know the benefits to that and how better our community and even world could be. When your are driving a car and especially in big cities like New York you need a car everywhere or just take the taxi. But just taking the taxi it wont reduce the probablity of polluting the air, it will still have the same effect as if you were driving your own car. If people would just walk or bike to their job or to their school poluting the air would not be a problem just like stated in source 2. In source 2 it talks about how in Paris they would fine the people up to 31 dollars.

There would also be less traffic jams due to the limiting of car usage just like stated in Source 3. In source 3 it talks about how in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that the colombians would ride their bike skate or take the bus and there would be less traffic jams. That is a very good idea because no one likes to be stuck in traffic especially if your in a hurry to get to work or even school. Traffic jams occur because of so many cars on the road. There is a thing called Rush hour and that is when everyone is leaving their work or school and they are going home and that is when everyone is on the road and thats when their is the most traffic. But it would be much easier if you would just bike or walk or take a bus and tried to avoid all of those traffic jams. The program that Bogota, Colombia has created is something that should be done nationwide because it would help so many other countries. Thanks to that programm people would go to the park and do sports and take walks.

Source A talks about the Greenhouse gas and how in Vauban,Germany soccer moms gave up their cars and how the streets were "" Car Free"". That led to having 70 percent of the families in Vauban to not having  cars and 57 percent of the people that moved to Vauban to sell their cars. According to this source a person said they are much happier not owning or having a car because when Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother had a car she said she was more tense. Apperently this movement was called "" Smart Planning"".

Limiting car usage would be a great benefit to people and a great idea to improve Earth. Pollution like mentioned before is one of the biggest problems we have and in big cities is an evern bigger problem. Traffic jams is something that will be hard to stop because everyone is using cars and will continue to use cars because it seems like thats the fastest way to get to your location but thats not accurate because if people think that way then thats the cause of traffic jams and thats the cause of the Rush hour. The movement in Vauban, Germany is something that people should do. Im not saying sell your car but to reduce the car usage is something that would be very helpful not only to you, but for the environment.            ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

So, you know how some people say that school is the key to success? Well, I think they're kind of wrong. I mean, sure, it's important to get an education and all, but there are some things that are more important than just getting good grades. Like, have you ever thought about how much money you can make if you drop out of school and start working? Like, seriously, it's a lot. And if you stay in school and finish early, you can start earning money even sooner.

I know some people might say that staying in school is the best option, but let's be real, it's not always easy. Sometimes it's hard to focus in class, and you might not be interested in what the teacher is talking about. And if you're not interested, you're not going to learn anything. And if you don't learn anything, how are you supposed to pass the test? And if you don't pass the test, you might not graduate. And if you don't graduate, you might not get into college. And if you don't get into college, you might not get the job you want.

But, if you drop out of school and start working, you can start earning money right away. You can get a job at a store or restaurant, or even start your own business. And if you work hard, you can make a lot of money. Like, a lot. And you can use that money to buy things you want, like a new phone or a video game console. And you can also save some money for the future, like for college or a car.

Now, I know some people might say that dropping out of school is a bad idea, because it can affect your future. Like, you might not be able to get into college or get a good job if you don't have a diploma. But, I think that's not fair.

Whether you're looking for a new pair of sneakers for everyday wear or a stylish pair of heels for a special occasion, it's important to make a decision that will meet your needs and budget. One way to make a better decision is to seek advice and opinions from family and friends.

7DC02C918305," The path to success in life is paved with positivity. It is crucial to be positive in your decisions, as this will ultimately determine whether you achieve your goals and dreams. While it may be tempting to take decisions based on what others say, it is essential to believe in yourself and what you want to achieve.

When I started school, I was both positive and negative. On one hand, I was excited about what I wanted to achieve and what my goals were. On the other hand, I was unsure of myself and my surroundings. However, I soon realized that I had one reason to keep going: my son. I was determined to provide him with a better future, and this motivation kept me going.

As time passed, I found important people in my life who helped me stay positive. My friends were always positive and supportive, and their encouragement helped me feel more confident in myself. When I talked to them, I felt a sense of positivity and hope for the future.

Now, as I enter my final year of school, I feel good about where I am and what I have achieved. I am confident that I can make my dreams a reality, and I am excited to see what the future holds.

It is important to remember that life is full of challenges and obstacles, and it is crucial to be prepared for anything that comes your way. However, with a positive attitude and a strong belief in yourself, you can overcome any obstacle and achieve your goals.

In conclusion, the key to achieving success in life is to always be positive, strong, and believe in yourself. No matter what new changes come your way, never give up and always put your life in God's hands.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

They said that this is just a huge rock formation with shadows giving the illuion of the facial features. Also weater this was real or fake they still hoped it would be a good way to get mars in public attention. It most certainly did get the attention they wanted Mars to get. And if we never took those last photos what would of happen to this research project.

As they told us in the story that this as probably just a huge rock formation with shadow giving it the facial feautures to make it look like a person. Some people stil dont belive NASA that that is what it is, they think alliens created that. But those people are probaly wrong becasue those people dont get close looks like NASA and dont get to go into space and look at that these things like NASA gets to do. Also no aliens would just go out on mars and make a random face there for everyone to look at. It pretty much is just a huge rock if you look at it from the pictures and you can tell that the shadows are giving its facial features.

Next, this was all to hopefuly get Mars into some publicity with us and make us pay a little bit more attention now that they hade what some people think is a faec on Mars. And for everyone to try to get Mars this public attention they succeded because everyone started talking about Mars a little more. By the people talking about Mars was not just people it was Hollywod films, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunting grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. When Mars got onto the talk shows and the Hollywood films it strted to get bigger and everone start talking about it even more than they already were.

Also when the Viking missions were over and the talk started to die down a little NASA went back and took more pictures of that so called face again and more closer this time. When they took the photos the first time it was Mar's cloudy month and you couldnt see the ""face"" very clear and good to get good looks at it. And that wasnt the last time the took another picture of it because on April 5, 1998 ""Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos""(7). Then after taking the such good photos they were going to upload them to a JPL web site where they had thousands of anxioius web surfers wating to see the image(7). Once they posted it and everyone got their look at it on the web site they said "" a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" (7).

Last, after all the people though that it was a alien and NASA

thought it was just a shadow NASA was right. Also maybe if we never gave Mars all the public attention you would never know if ths would happen either. And if that last picture that had been ten times better than the originals not been taken then we may not of never knew if it was a alien or the NASA research of just being a shadow.

Having this technology in schools will also help parents because the parents don't have to buy a computer that can try to handle this type of technology.

If teachers do a test on students that are getting bulied or getting picked on, this type of technology will help teacher get students to speak up and or find the person that is bullys other students. By showing the student that's getting pick on a picture of students the teacher thinks who maybe the person bulling the student, the student may make a fear face on the picture of the person that is picking on the student.

If teachers see that a student is failing their classes and don't talk a lot in school, the teachers can make a test on that student to see if they are going through things back at home. Teachers can have the students parents to come to the school while the student is being tested, they can have a converation on what makes the student angry or depressed about.

Those are some example why I think this type of technology can really help teachers and parents learn about their students or children that they don't want to speak of. This can also help parents that can't afford this type of technology at home and having this technology at school, parents can bring their children to the school and have them get tested on what's bothering them at school or home.

DC4C58A0643D,"Forida senator, I argue to remove the Electoral College and replace it by changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Voting is not fair to the people because they can't vote for the President, only for the state electors, and even if the candidate that won the most popular votes, may not be elected. Also, the winner-takes-all system is not fair to voters because the candidates don't spend time in states they cannot win in or small states and mostly in swing states.

""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" The passage stated in paragraph 10. Voting has changed over many years, but I think that people should be able to vote for the President and have that candidate win the election if they get the magority of popular votes. If the people want to have that candidate as the President, so be it. Although the Electoral College may help by not having a tied election and have a ""Certainty of Outcome"", but it should be what the people want and vote for. In my opinion, it would be better to not feel like you're putting in a vote that isn't what you wanted. The vote from the people go to state electors for them to choose and that is not truely fair to the people.

The candidates should spend time in all states to try to get their vote instead of the winner-takes-all system; therefore, it should be removed. There are people in the state that have voted for that candidate but they don't go to the state because they only focus on the swing states. I understand that they do go there to try to win the election and become president, but they should at least spend some amount of time in other states. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" As stated in the passage in paragraph 13.

So overall, the electoral college should be replaced by having the popular vote be the decider of who gets to be president. It's fair to the people and to the country.                             ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
D684AE8A9418,"Fitting in to society is something that many people strive for, but what does it really mean? In this essay, I will explore the various ways in which people attempt to fit in, analyze the fear of making mistakes and its impact on our character, compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of imitating people we admire, and argue that our character is formed by influences beyond our control.

One way in which people attempt to fit in is through conformity. This involves adhering to the norms and expectations of society, often without question. For example, people may dress in a certain way, speak a certain way, or hold certain beliefs in order to fit in with their peers. However, conformity can also lead to a lack of individuality and creativity.

Another way in which people attempt to fit in is through rebellion. This involves actively rejecting the norms and expectations of society in order to stand out. For example, people may dress in a way that is different from the norm, speak a certain way that is considered taboo, or hold beliefs that are unpopular. However, rebellion can also lead to social isolation and a lack of acceptance.

The fear of making mistakes can have a significant impact on our character. When we are afraid of making mistakes, we may be hesitant to take risks and try new things. This can lead to a lack of personal growth and development. Additionally, the fear of making mistakes can cause us to be overly critical of ourselves, which can lead to low self-esteem and a lack of confidence.

Imitating people we admire can have both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, imitating people we admire can help us to develop positive qualities and behaviors. For example, if we admire someone who is kind and generous, we may be more likely to be kind and generous ourselves. On the other hand, imitating people we admire can also lead to a lack of individuality and creativity. Additionally, if we are not careful, we may end up imitating negative qualities and behaviors as well.

Our character is formed by a combination of influences beyond our control, including genetics, upbringing, and environment. While we may have some control over certain aspects of our character, such as our beliefs and behaviors, we are ultimately shaped by the world around us. For example, our gen",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,9
D06845D6FB0B,"When people ask for advice, they should seek multiple people for their opinions so they can be able to make a better choice. Because, when asking one person, people are often given a response that they do not want to hear or personally don't agree with. So when you seek multiple opinions, people will be given multiple responses, ones they may or may not like to hear. So you will be able to pick and choose which one you believe is the best. You can seek out to other people that are older then you and they will help give better advice, since this is something they probably went through when they were younger. Seeking multiple opinions might also help you really know what you should do, people might give you advice that you know won't help or won't lead you to a good choice. So when seeking multiple opinions, you should still always look back at your own advice. Because after all when making a decision, you must really think it through, making a decision is like a give or take so when you seek multiple people it will potentially lead you to the best decision to make for the situation.

When asking someone for advice you may be told something you weren't really expecting. Or it may be something you don't like , or it wouldn't lead you to make a good decision in your situation. You may feel the need to follow that person's advice because you may have thought that they were ""good"" at giving advice. Or even so , you are just very stuck in the situation and really have no idea what to follow or listen to. So when you seek multiple people you are going to get different advice in what to follow. But sometimes people give you the same advice. What should you do then? If you are asking multiple people for advice in a situation and they are all giving you a similar response or the same thing. Then that's when you really start to consider if the decision is good or bad, think about how the decision will work out in the long run. Will it really be worth it? You will get that sudden feeling when you know someone is giving you good advice and that you should follow it. Knowing when someone is giving you good advice is like knowing someone is a good person , you might have to think about it for a while. But in the end it will really pay off and it will be worth it.

When you are seeking for someone's opinions in a situation and you decide to ask multiple people for their opinions and see what they say. You are then given the choice to pick and choose what you believe is the best choice. And I mean pick and choose like, who's advice is the best to follow? who's advice will actually help me in the long run?, Just by thinking about those questions it will lead you to the right choice. if in a situation you seek out to multiple people you should always consider what you want, and what will help you make the right choice in your situation. You are getting the opportunity to have multiple people seek out to you and help you, so you should most definitely use it to the best of your abilities. A lot of people always say ""if you are given an opportunity you should most definitely take advantage of it"". If you reach out to some family members or friends you should listen to the person who has gone through the same thing or something similar because their advice may be the most accurate.

When you are seeking multiple opinions it might help you by yourself realize what you should actually do in the situation. This is because if you are often given a response that you don't like or just don't want to hear or you may believe it will not help you in the situation you are in. Then that means that you actually know what's best for you to do in the situation. You know what's best and what will help you , it means that you know what advice to listen to or not. You will be able to put your advice and the person's advice that you believe will help you the most. When you seek out to multiple people you will know what not to do an what to do. You will know that because if someone gives you advice that you believe is not good and you won't do. You can start thinking about what you want to do and take bits from other peoples advice and put them with some of your advice. Asking multiple people will help you make the decision and also know what to do. You will know who to go for when it comes to advice and you will be thankful for the advice you were given.

When people are asking for advice they should always seek to multiple people because they will get to hear different peoples opinions and they are getting the option to choose what someone is telling them or told them. While others may disagree that you should only seek out to one person since they will give you advice and you should listen to theres because it might confuse you to hear other peoples advice. You should always reach out to multiple people. Not everyone is good at giving advice, and not everyone's advice will help you in the long run so when you seek out to multiple people you can really think about whos is the best and whos advice you would like to follow. Seeking to multiple people will help you make the best decision possible due to all the people that are going to help you and tell you heir advice and what they believe is the best for you while you're in a situation. So when listening to other people's advice you should always reflect back to your own advice before doing anything because that may be the best thing.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
7065B172D758,"As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that it is important to do your best to solve a problem. Whether it's a small issue or a large one, taking the time to put in effort and find a solution can have a significant impact on our lives. In this essay, I will discuss why it is important to do your best to solve a problem and provide examples of personal experiences and well-known anecdotes to support my arguments.

Firstly, solving a problem can lead to personal growth and development. When we face a challenge, we are forced to think critically and creatively, which can help us develop important skills such as problem-solving, decision-making, and communication. For example, when I was in the 6th grade, my class was given a group project to design and build a robot. At first, I was unsure of how to approach the problem, but with some research and brainstorming, I was able to come up with a solution that not only worked but was also creative and unique. This experience not only taught me how to solve a problem, but also helped me develop important teamwork and leadership skills that I still use today.

Secondly, solving a problem can lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. When we put in effort to find a solution, we feel a sense of pride and achievement when we finally overcome the challenge. For example, when I was in the 4th grade, I was struggling with my math homework. I tried several different methods, but nothing seemed to work. However, after seeking help from my teacher and doing some extra practice, I was able to finally understand the material and solve the problems. This experience not only improved my math skills, but also gave me a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that I had worked hard to achieve.

Finally, solving a problem can have a positive impact on others. When we find a solution to a problem, we can share it with others who may be experiencing the same issue. This can help alleviate their struggles and improve their lives. For example, when I was in the 7th grade, I noticed that several of my friends were struggling with anxiety and stress. I did some research and found some helpful coping strategies that I shared with them. This not only helped my friends, but also gave me a sense of purpose and fulfillment in knowing that I had made",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,4
3165FA4998BC,"Senator, we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College establishes judgement and fairness by giving upcoming presidents a fair shot. People have voices and the popular vote can be biased from state to state. The proccess if mature because they chose unbiased electors, and there is a majority of 270 electoral votes. The Electoral College has 538 electors, which gives a good amount of unbiases people. They figure this amount by one for each member in the House of Representaties plus two for the Senators, which you could be one.

The Electoral College is one of the best ways to keep a fair election. We people do not make the brightest decisions sometimes, and the Electoral College keeps us from making the wrong decision for who is going to be our next president.

People can be easily affected into turning on a candidate. They could not realize that the candidate would be a great president. The Electoral College gives the candidates a fair chance. The member of the Electoral College are fair and know what is best for the country. The specific Electoral electors for your state vote what the state wants, and is not biased on what other senators or electors want. This gives the people a good amount of say in the election.

Electoral Colllege keeps the people in line and gives the people a sense of establishment. The election of the president is every four years. This gives people time to decide on a new president and who they want representing their votes. Overall the Electoral College is one of the brightest decisions that America has made. For one the Electoral College gives people a fair chance in becoming president. Also the Electoral College helps make the voting process a lot easier.

While cars do simplify our lives today, in the near future cars will become a burden, due to the amount of pollution they produce and the stress they cause upon individuals. Limiting car usage in all parts of the world will bring more joy and persistent smiles.

Cars play a dramatic role in the amount of pollution that is in our air today. Which is also essential for our survival. Limiting car usage will decrease the amount of pollution we have today and the disgusting greenhouse gas emissions.

"". Furthermore, in the capital of France due to ""intensifying smog 60 percent"" of the individuals were in a severe traffic jam explained by Robert Duffer, in ""

Paris band driving due to smog

"". The smog was caused by cold nights and warm days and the warmer layer of air enprisoning car emissions and pollutuion; pollutions being caused by over usage of cars, meaning car usage should be limited if not haulted all at once.

Individuals participating in events like Car-free day and living in towns like Vauban tend to be a lot more joyful and enthusiastic. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said by an individual named Heidrun Walter, who moved to Vauban for a more jubilating experience. Cars add stress due to having to be stuck in agonising traffic and having to pay for ridiculous gas prices. Also, by limiting car usage you'll witness and hear more individuals enjoying themselves walking the street, and ""the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drowning out the occasional distant motor."" described by Robert Duffer, in ""

Most students love after school or in school activities, for example the football team if this school didn't have a football team students that enjoy football would be mad. Same with every other sport, schools need to have extra activities or they will not be as good as ones that do. Students might want to switch schools if they don't have activities they enjoy, because other schools might have things they enjoy, like sports and clubs.

It will also make their school look better if all students are in a extracurricular activity. It could possibly expand the choices of what students might like too. There are plenty activities to choose from and students should have to at least choose one. Even if it's from cards to basketball it doesn't matter but schools should have students doing something. Schools should have a system to where you can make your own ""club"" or activity. So then if students don't like what their school offers them then they can make a activity they enjoy.

Making students do after school activities would also bring them closer together. They could meet new people and make more friends. Also it will overall bring the school closer together.

Asking for advice can also be cost-effective when compared to the possible costs of making the wrong decision. 

Nevertheless, it is also important to consider the drawbacks of not wanting or seeking advice from another when in need of assistance.

Furthermore, not asking for advice can also be detrimental to helpful relationships with others in certain situations.

I have noticed that some of the streets and ground is full of trash. Trash bags, litter, paper, water bottles, plastic, and other stuff. We should stop the littering and everyone should pitch into clean up our earth so creatures like birds, dear, fish, and other animals can flourish. Also if we keep our community clean it will look allot nicer then people would live in the area just because its clean. So i suggest that everyone in the schools fourth grade and up can go to an after school program to help our community. days like Mondays and Tuesdays would be good, or whenever some one sees trash.

If every school every person cleans up every community, then i promise we will live in a much beautiful place to call home. Here is some tips on how to keep our community's clean, have a large trash bin on every curve of every house, have trash bins in a park, if you see some trash laying around then pick it up and put it in the trash, if you cant find a trash bin then hold it until you find one. Follow these steps to clean the community clean.

Think about this, if every kid in every school cleans up the environment, and if there's 500 kids in each school then that's a whole lot of people helping the community.

In every part of our life, we need someone to share something with them.

Maybe they are our family or friends.

In these days, people are more self-reliance. They think, we don't need anyone to guidance us.

But I think in every moment of life, we need someone, who had a lot of experts to guidance us.

Father and mother are the best persons, to share our everything in our life.

They have a lot of experience and important matters in life. They can feel us In every situation.

We always should ask from our mother or father, about our life decisions.

we should have someone to hear us and support us.

Our parent experience can be a lesson for us.

Experiences make our life. We should learn something from the experiences.

Life is full of thing, actually new thing. Everyday we meet a new thing in our life. That we don't know what is it? and where is it come from? Our parent are older than us, they know everything. They were in our age and now they're older than us. thats means, they understand better about us and about our situation.

My mom she always feel me. If i am sad even if i didn't tell her she know that I am sad. Because she's older than me. She was in my age before me.

We are like a person that don't know about anything, because everything is new for us. Because we don't have any experiences of the thing.

My uncle, he was 17 years old. He wanted to open a small fast food in our country. He always just listen to himself.

He didn't share anything with anyone until he did the work, than he comes and tell us that what I did.

Everyone was sad about him because he was younger and he don't know about anything.

His mother and father told him to finish school first then open a fast food, but he didn't listened to them.

He leaved the school and started his work. In the first he was so happy, but after a few months he become sad.

When he saw his all friends going to school and he works he felt sad.

He was so regretful, because of what he did. He didn't listen to his parent and he just did what he wants.

Than he came to his parent and said sorry, because of not sharing his idea with his parents.

My grandfather said to him"" I was in your age, I did the same mistake that you did, but in different way. I told you to school is the first important thing in our life, you can't leave an important thing in life"".""I had the experience that why i was trying to tell you that. ""My son always share whatever you have in your mind with the person that you can trust and believe, and listen to them, they will always guide you"".

Finally he understood, what he did was wrong, but he also like to work too.

That time he came to his father and share that he wants to study and work.

His father was so happy that his son come and asked him for showing the good way.

His father guide him and show him that what should he do.

He went to school and also continued his work too.

Right now he's a businessman, he always says"" to us to share anything with your family or friends"".

He said that to us"" the way that I am success and a good businessman was my dad experience, my dad guidance"".

I learn from my uncle that if your mom and dad teach you how to speak and how to eat and.... they also can teach us how to life good.

I always ask from my mom and share my day happens with her.

She hear me and feel me. Sometime before i say anything she know, I'm thinking about what and what I want to tell her. Having the experience are good, you know better how to solve a problem and guide someone who trust you.

If I have a plan for future I will share it with my mom, she support me and guide me.

E03990305B4E,"The role a car plays in the life of an individual has made changes through out the years. There never was a significant meaning to having a car; it just meant having a vehicle that can get you from point A to point B. As the human society continues to progress with the creations of technology, the use of cars has diminished greatly in different parts of the world. Not being able to use a car seems like there is no bright side, but there are actually many advantages on limiting car usage.

The United States always had this recognition of being one of the world's prime car cultures. ""The first Model T cars were born in the U.S. It has also been the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized 'Mustang Sally."" President Barack Obama identifies in the article,

The End of Car Culture, his dreams for the U.S ""to curb the United State's geen house gass emissions will get a forturious assist from an incipent shift in American behavior."" Going back to the article as reference, studies show ""americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by... as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak... there was also a drop in percent of 16- to 39- year olds getting a license."" The cause of the downfall in car usage can be pointed towards a few factors; internet making telecommuting possible, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of cellphones and car-pooling apps. It is not because society assumes cars are becoming of no use, the role of technological improvements are making things a lot easier than how things were in the 1960's. The United states has the option of using cars or not, in other places like Paris, the option to drive has become a choice made out of a person's own power.

Paris, France is a location that anyone dreams of visiting. The city is beautiful but the levels of smog have made it impossible for people to enjoy the views of the city. According to the article,

Paris bans driving due to smog , ""it has been enforced to the citizens of a partial driving ban in order to clear the air... people were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine which is $31 in the United States."" The way things are organized in Paris goes by a person's license plate number. In correlation to the article, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifiying smog."" However, not all of the cars used in Paris, France were banned. Those cars that are plug-ins, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers were allowed to roam the street of Paris. A good majority, 67 percent, of vehicles in France are made up of diesel, and that kind of fuel were the ones to blame since gasoline was not in favor in a city like that one. In the same way, places like Bogota, Colombia, had similar situations as the peolpe that live in France.

In the country of Colombia there has been a day dediated to doing things with no car; it's a car-free day. In contrast to how banning driving is in Paris, Bogota, Colombia has everyone participate in this 24 hour event. If a person were to violate the rule they are to face $25 fines. The article,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, explains that ""millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during the car-free day."" Just like the goals in Paris, Colombia has goals to promote alternatice transportation and reduce smog. A businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, explains ""it's  good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" No one would everythink that driving is as stressful as going to work. When put into mind, things begin to make sense. The early mornings of road rage people encounter makes their entire day a little more stressful than what it should be. Driving is a wonderful advantage but there is always more than just a car. Colombia's main goal, as expressed in the article ""is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.""

In the end of it all cars have always been in the making; trying to find new ways to improve and modernize. Although cars may have had significant meanings in the older times, as society continues to prosper in technological making, cars are beginning to be identified as material objects that are not as important. They are just in use for people to get from one place to the next when other things are not working.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

I also think that just because we have all this new and improved technolgy shouldn't mean to use it.

One reason I say it woulldn't be important to to have a facial regontion in a class for students is because maybe the kid is angery or sad and if you find that out then talk to them about it it could bring up bad memories so the kid would eventualy just shut down and not talk at all.

Another reason is that you could trigger some built up anger and then they could cause a bunch of unneeded choas or potentiely they could judt have enough of the bull crap and take matters into their own hands and i'm just saying but it could also cause more school shootings and this point in the U.S we don't need that on our hands.

the final reason is that anymore technology is getting to out of hand in eyes like whatever happend to going outside and having fun instead sitting in frount of a screen play your life away to video games when we could do something to make this world a better place.

406287CE2DF9,"Dear Principal,

I think that not allowing phones at all would be your best choice. When the students are at school, they are there with their friends so they don't actually need their phones with them to communicate. The students don't need to text their friends at lunch when they could just walk over to them and say hi. The students need to learn important social skills to get through life, and cell phones could cause them not to learn these skills.

Second, even if phones were just allowed during free time, I'm sure you'd see their effects elsewhere, too.

Having phones during school would encourage cheating because is gives the students silent ways exchange answers. Also, you might also find that the students are less focused on the material they are learning and more focused when they can next update their facebook status.

Lastly, if students are in the middle of a conversation on their phones when lunch ends, it's very likely they won't stop the conversation just because they have to go to class. You might find that students are going to the bathroom to use their phones or texting their friend from under the desk. This leads to not paying attention in class and missing out on important information, which can affect their grade by a lot.

As you can see, it would be best to keep your school phone-free for the good of the students and their social skills. The students can live without their phones for six hours a day, and they can actually talk to their friends instead of texting them. I strongly believe that you should not allow phone on your school grounds and I very much hope you agree with me.

A6AECACCFAA8," A problem can be a valuable opportunity for growth and improvement, or it can be a source of frustration and pain. While it is true that we can learn from our mistakes, there are also times when we cannot. Not everyone is capable of recognizing the potential benefits of a problem, and some may choose to ignore or avoid them altogether.

One of the key things to consider when it comes to problems is the role of choice. We have the power to choose our problems, and we also have the ability to choose how we respond to them. It is important to recognize that we do not have to have a problem in order to do our best, and that we can be good at something without facing any challenges.

Some problems are inherently positive, as they force us to confront and address our weaknesses and limitations. When we face a problem that we cannot change, it is important to recognize that it does not define us, and that we have the power to grow and improve in spite of it. It is also important to remember that even those who are living a good life may still face problems and challenges.

In order to be the best version of ourselves, it is important to work out our problems and use them as opportunities for growth and improvement. By learning from our mistakes and using them to better ourselves, we can become stronger and more resilient. It is important to remember that we are not defined by our mistakes, but rather by how we choose to learn from them and grow as individuals.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

What would happen to the data base of a company if its system crashed, how would signals get out from the cars routers?

Having driverless cars would be a bad idea, for one it would take the place of a taxi driver which would take away jobs. Googles cofounder Sergey Brin says ""...a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility that a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" Another reason I wouldnt condone in the submitting of driverless cars would be to save the generation after me. Letting fresh young adults use driverless cars wouldnt teach them how to drive. Which means they wouldnt know what to do in case of an emergency. Yes there would be a manual that you'd have to read. But when it comes to fixing technology and mechanics, humans need a hands on experience which would help them in case they dont know what to do if the car becomes driverless. Finally, what would happen in a storm if the connection didnt go through or the companys system crashed? Would that mean the car isnt driverless? ""...For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors.

9EDDBD90E1CF,"As soon as the manufacturing of cars came into role, people all over the world have shifted their ways of getting around into using cars. Cars positively bring faster transportion within cities and areas of neccessity. Even though pople spend alot on gas to feed their cars, they see past that and proceed to use their vehicles. Although cars may offer easy access and convenience, they can affect the enviroment with the releasing of carbon gas emissions and smog, trapping in gas.

Limiting car usage can benefit the enviroment and life of residents by ensuring them a safe area of living. If we can limit car usage it will greatly benefit us in different ways. Cars tend to drive people crazy. Traffic is a prime example where people can get frustrated. Whether you're in a rush in rush hour or having to get to some place you need, traffic can make you tense and unhappy. For example, Heidrun Walter, a resident from a car forbidden city - Vauban, Germany - said "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. "", with this said you can conlude that car limitation can benefit us emotionally.

To get more in depth, Vauban is an experimental upscale community where streets attempt to be car free. This city is an example of what car limitation can be capable of. Cars have gases and carbon emission that are released when put in use. This can harm our atmosphere by trapping in greenhouse emssions. Statistics from experts demonstate that in Europe passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and up to an unbelievable 50 percent in the United States alone. The efforts of car limitation can be an advantage into stopping these gases from growing in the near future.

Paris, France is a smog filled European city due to the large congestion and diesel engines. On a Monday motorists with even-numbered plates had to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 dollar fine. Due to the restriction, congestion over the following five days was down 60 percent. Also opening up, wasthe free charge of the public transit. The restriction of cars opened up great advantages to decline the number of congestion which lowered the percentage of carbon emissions. If the population can take the limitations one period at a time the communities can experience cleaner air and healthier enviroments.

In conclusion, although cars are a covinient and easy way to get around, they can result in the harming of the enviroment and us as individuals. If we can all lower the emissions and sorts of congestions, the world and people can start to be happy knowing they're living in healthy enviroments with the inspirations of these cities such as Paris and Vauban.     ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

Extracurricular programs are more school work and/or more time that students have to spend at school. Not many students want that. Students should not have to participate in extracurriculars because they might not have enough time, they will have no intrest in something they don't want to do and most students don't want that extra work. I know that most students don't want to do extracuricular activities and for the ones that do they will take them i nthe first place.

The first reason I think students should not have to take extracurricular activites is because a lot of them won't have time. It's that simple. After school, rather than going to some club or activity that they don't want to take in the first place, they may have sports practice or homework and studying to do. Whatever the student has after school is probabaly more important than the extracurricular activity that they are forced to take. For the activities that are in school, there will still be work to get done out of school as well. As a student I know that having too much can be very stressful.

The second reason I think students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities is they will have a lack of intrest. Most students won't want to take the program so they won't try while taking it. It will be hard for whoever is running the program to teach, especially if it's not a grade and no one cares about it. On top of all that it will be a waste of time for both the students and the teacher and they just won't want to be there.

Finally, while the students aren't enjoying the extracurricular activity they will be rushing to get their work finished just get out that class or go home. The students are also likely to have an atitude and be rude to the instructor. Abviously the instructor won't like this and they too won't want to be running this program but he/she may be at force to run it like the students are to take it.

The three main reasons why students should not have to do extracurricular activites are not enough spare time for students, lack of intrest in program they are taking and students need free time time away from school rather than more work. Any school that makes students participate in extracurricular activites are just being cruel and mean to their students! It's extra curricular and not required curricular.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

E0C521DEB367," I disagree with the school board's decision to increase the amount of time students spend in school. While I understand the importance of education, I believe that students need to have their own time outside of school to spend with their families and friends.

Furthermore, I believe that students should have a say in this decision. The school board should consider the opinions of students and take them into account when making decisions that affect their lives. This could be done by conducting a survey or focus group to gather feedback from students about their thoughts on the proposed changes.

In addition, I think that the school board should consider the potential negative impact of keeping students in school for longer hours. For example, students may experience burnout or fatigue, which could lead to decreased academic performance. It is important for the school board to weigh the benefits of increased school time against the potential negative consequences.

C255CCC30A3E," The Advantages and Disadvantages of Technology

Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society cannot be denied. On one hand, technology has brought numerous benefits to individuals and communities, such as improved communication, access to information, and convenience. On the other hand, it has also brought about negative consequences, such as privacy concerns, addiction, and the spread of misinformation.

One of the most significant advantages of technology is its ability to connect people across vast distances. With the help of social media, instant messaging, and video conferencing, individuals can easily communicate with friends and family members who live far away. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to find information and resources. Search engines, online databases, and e-commerce platforms have made it possible to access a wealth of information and purchase goods and services from the comfort of one's own home.

However, technology has also brought about negative consequences. For example, the rise of social media has led to a growing concern about privacy and the spread of fake news. Social media platforms collect vast amounts of personal data on their users, and this data can be used for targeted advertising or even sold to third parties. Additionally, the spread of fake news and misinformation on social media has become a significant problem, as it can lead to confusion, fear, and even violence.

Another disadvantage of technology is the potential for addiction. Many people have become so reliant on their devices that they struggle to disconnect and engage in other activities. This can lead to a lack of social skills, a sedentary lifestyle, and even mental health issues.

In conclusion, technology has both advantages and disadvantages. While it has brought numerous benefits to individuals and society, it has also brought about negative consequences. It is important for individuals to be aware of these advantages and disadvantages and to use technology in a responsible and balanced way.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

You cast your vote thinking that your voting for a president when actually your voting for that candidates electors. Electoral college is unfair, irrational, and could have some really serious consequences.

Electoral college is not fair at all to the people voting. When you vote for president, most of the time you think that your voting for the person that you think will really help to improve this country. With electoral college, you might as well just vote directly for the electors. If all your vote is doing is going to the electors, then presidential candidates shouldn't even advertise themselves because in the end your not voting for them, your voting for the electoral college for that candidate.

The presidential candidates don't go to all the states when running. They simply go to the states that they know will support them and the states that will most likely vote against them. What about all the other states that arent neccesarly with or against the candidate? They don't ever see any advertisements for the candidates, the person in the presidential race doesnt go to see them, and so when they vote they are basically blindsited by the name on the ballet. It's completly irrational to only go to the states that love you or hate you.

The best argument against the electoral college is something called the disaster factor. To make a long story short, basically it's that the state legislatures pick the electors, and those electors could always defy the rights and will of the people. For example, you could vote for a presidential candidate, but hisher electors cast their vote for the opposing candidate. That's taking away your right to vote for the person that you want to win.

When voting, your vote should go to the person that you chose. Not who the electoral college for that person called. Electoral collages have so many flaws in the system. It's unfair to the people voting, not all the states get as much exposure to the candidate as others, and the system could totally collapse on itself if the electors dont vote for the person that you voted for. That is why popular voting is the best way to elect a political figure. Your vote is going to the person you choose, not to the person someone else chooses for you.",0,train_essays,,0

On the first day of

Summer Break one is thinking about all the things he's going to be doing, like:relax all day, go on vacation, hang out with friends or family, play video games, and do non-school related things. Suddenly, he or she gets an email from their teacher saying,""I hope everyone is enjoying summer so far, over the summer you will have to do a project on what you have learned this year."" At the end of the email is the instructions the teacher says you have to do for your project. After reading the email one closes his laptop or turns off his phone with anger, because that one teacher ruined his summer.

How are people supposed to enjoy their summer break when a teacher gives them school-related stuff to do. Some teachers complain all the time about them having to grade all types of work when a student doesnt do his work. Teachers shouldn't complain because,all they had to do is not give students any work especially over the summer. Then that will make the teachers job way much easier, because they won't have much stuff to grade and worry about planning to do.

Summer projects should be student-designed because, first of all student-designed projects, our more relaxful then teacher-designed projects. Student-designed projects would show more creativeness, and is more helpful. Second, they can show how much one has learned. While teacher-designed projects are much more stressful, one will have to do it rule,by rule, by rule, one little mess up can lower your score by a whole grade. On teacher- designed projects the teacher also won't really tell who learned more, because they will all be very similar. Teacher-designed projects are also boring, because it's better when you can use your own ideas instead of someone else ideas. Teachers most of the time always give the people with the most perfectly organized project the best grade, when they dont even have good facts or anything about the project, while the people with not that good of organization but a lot of good information on the project get a lower grade.

One might ask, ""what is the reason for having a project during summer because that is when we have a break from school?""

That's just like saying,""why do athletes like basketball players practice during off season?"" If a athlete does not practice during off season, they can probably lose their skill, be out of shape,and not get any better for the next season. Just like if we dont have any projects or work over the summer we can forget how to do certain stuff, and not be ready for the next school year. I still dont agree with the idea of projects during summer though because thats what fourth quarter projects should be about. It should be about what you learned over the school year, instead of having to waste time in the summer doing a project . If one still had to do a project over the summer it should also be optional extra credit for the next school year. One shouldn't be forced to do school work over a time when you are supposed to be enjoying the summer off. One of my favorite sayings is from Allen Iverson when he said,""Practice? Your'e talking bout practice? I am an All Star and you are talking about practice?"" That is what I would think about if a teacher emailed me during the summer and is talking to me about doing a project when i should be resting. What's the point of summer if you are just going to be doing school work?      ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
DF554AD625EA,"Did you know that the planet Venus has a lot of Earth like similarities? Well in the story ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports this idea giving factual evidence one being,Venus is somewhat referred to as Earths ""twin"", Venus has a dangerous climate and dosen't have the resources needed for our living conditions, and Not a single spaceship has been to Venus in more than three decades.

First of all, Venus is somewhat referred to as Earth's ""twin"". In paragraph two the author explains one way of how Venus and Earth are the same. The author states "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too."" In this way the author is implying the physical features are similar. The author also states that "" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to Earth. Like Mountains, rocky sediment, and even valleys."" Even though Venus has the same physical features as Earth its not the same as the things we need in order to live.

In addition, Venus has a dangerous climate and dosen't have the resources needed for our living conditions. In paragraph three the author gives a description of the conditions on Venus. The author states that "" A thick atmosphere of almost ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" This here states that if humans were to travel to Venus they would not be able to survive because Venus's atmosphere is different from Earth. Not only that but the author also states that "" On the planet's surface, tmeperatures average over eight-hundred degrees Farenheit."" With that being said these living conditions are to extreme for humans to encounter because the pressure is ninety times greater than what humans expeirence on our own planet.

Finally, Not a single spaceship has been to Venus in more than three decades. In the text it says ""Such an enviornment would liquify an metals"" With this being said everybody know spaceships are made of metal and that is why no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. The text also states that "" Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation of being a challenging planet for humans to study,despite its proximity to us."" In the end scientists are working to find better ways to advance in their technology and spacecraft to be able to continue their journey on Venus.

In conclusion the author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Because Venus is somewhat referred to as Earths ""twin"", Venus has a dangerous climate and dosen't have the resources needed for our living conditions, and Not a single spaceship has been to Venus in more than three decades. With these pieces of supporting evidence this explains the authors purpose in explaining why Venus is a worthy pursuit despit the dangers it presents.        ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
74C44149CA38,"Learning would not occur if kids were told to do it themselves, whenever they wanted. The integration of online classes in school causes a detrimental decline in learning. The schedule and structure of school prepares students for college and their jobs after school. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because learning is most efficient in a classroom setting, social interactions are important, and more dropouts would occur due to online classes.

Looking at a computer screen for hours at a time can affect one's mental state and ability to comprehend new information. Learning is most efficient in a classroom setting where students can ask questions and collaborate with their peers. Students are able to discuss topics in group settings and get a deeper understanding of the material. In addition, students are more likely to keep up with their homework due to the encouragement of their peers, while online students often struggle do to the lack of motivation to get their work turned in on time. Classroom learning sets students up for success.

Online classes have a negative impact on the overall growth of students due to the lack of social interactions. Looking at a computer will not give kids the social skills they need in order to be successful. Having face-to-face conversations with their teacher, giving presentations in front of their whole class, and having group discussions are all things that online students miss out on. Those interactions lead to a greater understanding of the topics and students will remember giving a presentation rather than submitting a PowerPoint online. Social interactions are an important aspect in learning.

Online classes will lead to an increase in the number of dropouts. Students will take advantage of the freedom and flexibility of the courses and will not be motivated to get their work done. School provides a much needed structure for kids to learn in a controlled environment without outside factors getting in the way. There are too many external factors at home that can prevent students from learning to their full potential. Students will no longer be motivated to learn and ,therefore, more dropouts will occur.

Although it may sound convenient, online courses would do much more harm than good. Kids get distracted with their everyday lives and school is a structured place from them to learn. Learning in a classroom setting gives students the preparation they need for jobs after school. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because learning is most efficient in a classroom setting, social interactions are important, and more dropouts would occur due to online classes.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
1098BEDFB182,"Dear principal,

I disagree, i think we should be able to have a D or a C while playing sports because a D in the school is said to be a passing grade and you would be able to move into the next grade the next year, so in other words it wouldn't be fair if you wouldn't let us play sports with a D or C because its a passing grade. Also when people play sports its hard on them sometimes to keep work up so they get work in late sometimes which may make their grade an C or D which that would mean they couldn't play the sport anymore because they didn't turn in work on time. When they want to play basketball or any other sport and cant because they have a C or D that makes it so they cant play i don't think that would encourage them more to keep their grades up. To some students its hard keeping up a grade c average but now you want them to keep a B average so they wont even be in sports and that means that people could get even more obese than you want them. Telling people they need to have a B or higher average is going to make them not want to play or cant play and the school is going to loose money because we have to pay for sports. If you did this a lot of people might want to move to another school so they don't have to have B average and there goes even more money out the door because you made it so we have to have a B average. If you would change it then you might as well just give up sports altogether because most kids cant keep a B average in school. When and if you do this the school kids wont be happy and just throw their grades down the drain anyways. If you did this then new kids wouldn't want to go to this school and they wouldn't even try going here. This is why i strongly disagree with having to have a B average grade for playing sports.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
D9C7239183B8,"Many schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they are still learning during their summer brake. Do you think they should be Student-designed or teacher-designed?. They should be student-designed because it gives students a chance to be creative,they can learn something they are interested in,and finally lets them have fun with their projects during the summer.

Although some people may argue that letting the students choose their own projects would lead to them either not doing it or to them choosing the easiest subject and finishing it in a day or two,But there are other view points to consider.

First,Letting students choose their own projects will let them be creative. A lot of students like to stand out and be different from the rest of their peers. As many people know not every student is the same and not every student thinks the same way. So they should let the students express themselves in their projects and even teachers will get to see a whole other side to their students that they never knew they had. For example,every artist in the world are expressing them selves everyday with their art and millions of people love it,and do you think that a teacher assigned that art work to them?.

Secondly,Students will be able to work on something they are interested in. Many schools and teachers force kids into learning something they dont want to learn or have not interest in and that is why they dont retain any of the information. I understand that not every subject they need will catch there attention but when it comes to something they have a choice in learning most kids will choose what they are really interested in. Why? because we as people don't like it when someone tells us we have to learn this or do this assignment and when they do they are not going to do it with effort,why,because they don't like it or have interest in it. When they let the student choose what they want to learn then they will do it with passion and lost of interest because they like the subject and really want to learn more about and so they will try their best and they will learn new things about a subject that they never knew before. For example,Kaka was one of the greatest soccer players in the world,winning many champions of Europe and many others,and his parents were lawyers and wanted him to become oneas well but he had no interest in it. No matter how much his parents tried he didnt find interest in it until he started playing soccer and he loved with a passion and so his parents let him do that. So letting their son do something that he found interest in it led him to become one of the greatest soccer player the world has ever seen.

Finally,it lets the students have a little fun with their projects and during the summer. Now these students are still kids and still need to have fun during their summer brake because they did jest go thought months of learning and when they finally get out they have to learn even more. Plus if the project is teacher-designed then they are going to feel like they are back in school but if they choose what they wanna do for their project then they can have fun while doing it. Like i said in the above argument they will be learning something they have interest in and you never know with kids they can come up with some weirdest and funnest things for their projects. They are able to do many experiments for their projects when they dont feel obligated to do it and can jest do fun things that get it done.

In Conclusion,summer projects should be student-designed because it gives students a chance to be creative,they can learn something they are interested in,and finally lets them have fun with their projects during the summer. because of the reasons listed here,Students should choose there summer project. also these kids are our country's future and they need to know that expressing themselves is ok and letting people know what they want is also important.

2E91E0D33A5F,"The car is a staple in modern day society by many standards, it represents wealth, sociatal rank however; on the more negative side of the matter cars are the result of a majority of deaths in the United States. Alongside the fatalities, cars also pollute the environment that is so very delicate. The benifits of becoming car-free are immense and far outweigh the ""negatives"" that come alongside living without cars.

Cars as many people know see them are recognized for their glamour and attraction, but what is forgotten somewhere in the infatuation with cars is the true devastation they can cause. Cars in the United States and many other countries around the world account for a majority of the fatalities in total. Living without cars would completely irradicate the fatalities due to cars as well as reducing the stress that comes along with having such a hefty responsibility.

Along with the potential danger to humans, in the United States cars are the second largest source of emmisions right behind power plants according to paragraph 34. Countries like India and China are among the top few most polluted cities on this planet; now imagine the imact of implimenting a car-free law. The amount of pollution would go down immensely and the effect that this would have on the lifespan of people living in those countries would be incredulous. Some will argue that this will negatively have a change on their life. And to that I would say, are you willing to sacrifice some of the comfort that a car supplies you for a better life for your children and grandchildren?

Many people aknowledge that buying a car is arguably the second largest and expensive purchases that will be made in your life second to a house. The amount of money that would be saved from living a car-free life would be incredible. Without having to pay car payments, car insurance, and gas fees every month imagine what this money could be going towards. Removing such a monitary factor would reap such high rewards that so many would agree is completely worth some of the sacrifices that would have to be made.

All in all cars are not completely necessary, and that implimenting such a thing would have such a benificial outcome for society as a whole. Think not about the present but about the future of the world, and by living a car-free life you are bettering the present community as well as the future world.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
E69D5E1FEAB4,"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅

So, for this essay, I have to talk about making our own life decisions versus seeking guidance from experts and authorities. It's kinda like, do we want to be in control of our own lives or let someone else do it for us? 🤔

Okay, so, making our own life decisions can be pretty cool. Like, when I want to pick out my own clothes or decide what game to play with my friends, I feel like I'm in charge of my own life. It's like, I get to decide what I want and when I want it. And sometimes, making my own decisions can be really fun, like when I decided to try out for the school play and ended up getting a big part! 🎭

But, there are also some negative things about making our own decisions. Like, sometimes we might make choices that aren't good for us, like eating too much junk food or staying up too late playing video games. And if we're not careful, we might end up making mistakes that we can't fix, like getting into trouble with our parents or hurting someone's feelings. 🤦‍♀️

On the other hand, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be really helpful. Like, when my parents help me with my homework, they make sure I understand it and don't get it wrong. And when my doctor gives me advice on how to stay healthy, I know I'm getting good advice that will help me stay healthy and strong. 💪

But, sometimes seeking guidance can also be bad. Like, if we rely too much on others to make our decisions for us, we might not learn how to make good choices on our own. And sometimes, the people giving us guidance might not always be right, like when my teacher tells me to do something but it's not what I really want to do. 🤔

So, I think it's important to find a balance between making our own decisions and seeking guidance from experts and authorities. Like, we should try to make good choices on our own, but also be willing to ask for help when we need",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay discussing the positive and negative aspects of making your own life decisions versus seeking guidance from experts and authorities.,4
7DA7F08F38D2,"Why do people talk to more than one person when they ask for advice. I think people talk to more than one person because they need/want more than one opinion. they just want to make the right choice.

If you donÃÂ´t ask more than one person then more people could not want to hang out with you. I say that because some people are harsh and would not like what you beside to do. Most of the time people ask multiple people because they want more people to like what they do then more people hate what they do.

If you are trying to be the president of the United States then you will want more people to vote for you. the more people you ask and see what they want then you can say ÃÂ¨if I am president then I will do these thingsÃÂ¨. Then you would have a better chance of becoming president of the United States.

If you are going to a really nice restraint then you are going to want to read other peopleÃÂ´s reviews/opinions. If you see that a lot of people liked it there then you are most likely to want to go there. But if a lot of people donÃÂ´t like it there then you probably wont want to go there.

Limiting car usage is great because you can save money on gas. We all know gas prices are going up, why worry when we don't need cars? Just think about how much money you spend on gas.

In addition, conserving car time can be beneficial to our health. If we don't get our lazy butts out of bed just to sit in a car and get fatter then we would be so much happier. Remember that new years resolution you made to lose more weight? Well ride a bike to work everyday, or ride a skateboard to school. We will stay in shape this way.

In conclusion, there are so many reasons why limiting car usage is the way to go.

CA4E67209D3C,"Why is it important to ask multiple people for advice than just to ask one person. If you ask one person for advice you will probably get the same answer every time. Also you would be able to see how some of the ideas that are wrong. So asking advice from multiple people can help you get a different point of view on things, so you could try new ideas, and so you could see the bad idea.

One reason why seeking help from multiple people is because it would let you see things in different perspectives or point of views. One point of view could be like you should sell drugs. The other point of view is that you should not sell drugs. Then you start asking more people and more people are saying that you should not sell drugs.

Another reason why seeking advice from multiple people is that you could try a new idea. so lets say someone says ""you should go rock wall climbing"". Then another person says ""you should go swim with sharks"". You start asking and you go swim with sharks and then you climbed a rock wall.

Finally, why you should look for advice from multiple people is because it will show you all the negative ideas. One of those ideas could be to go break into a bank. Now this could be your best friend saying this. then you start asking around and people are saying that this is a bad idea. Right then and there the guy realized maybe my friend is not who he is.

All in all these few paragraphs show that looking for advice is a good thing. one reason is that it will show you all the different point of views from people. Another reason is that it will show you new ideas. Finally it will show you the bad ideas. All these show that asking multiple people for advice is a good thing.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
3D5C564AACDD,"Online classes or classes taken from home is an amazing privilege to have. Nowadays many college and even high school students have the opportunity to not go to school and take a class, but just stay in their house and just open up a computer and take the class online from the comfort of their own home. Online classes are very beneficial to students. Having online classes as an option students will be able to focus more, students will be able to go at their own pace to learn the material, and students are now sitting in an environment that makes them comfortable to sit in so they will be able to succeed more.

Online classes will cause students to fail. When given the option of online classes some students may take this as an opportunity to slack off and not get any work done. They might just say oh I still have a lot of time left and just procrastinate doing the work. And then the night before everything is due they might just rush on everything and not put much effort in it and get bad grades on the work. Resulting in them failing the class.

Having the option of online classes will allow students to focus more on whatever topic they are learning. When sitting in classrooms with other kids, people have the tendency to get distracted very easily. There are tons of classroom distractions in schools such as: The classroom door wide open, you would have the urge to look there every minute to see what is going on outside your class, same with if there is a window in the classroom. Another distraction is other students in the classroom. Some people have different ways in focusing, a kid might constantly click their pen to keep focus, while that kid thinks that that helps them focus other kids might think of that as distracting and annoying. Having all of these distractions in a classroom may cause you to not succeed in the class ending it in you failing the course and having to retake it.

Everyone learns a their own pace. Some kids are quick learners and learn a lot very fast, while others are really slow and take some time to learn. This ends in many teachers moving on with the curriculum if the majority of the class has learned. This is not the best thing to do. Some kids are just calm learners, meaning they are slow learners but if they need help with something they are not really the ones who speak up and tell someone, they just dwell on the topic for a while till they eventually teach themselves the topic. That is a terrible way for someone to learn. School is for kids to learn from teachers, students should not have to teach themselves what they are suppose to be learning from a teacher. So when kids have the option of taking an online class they now can learn all the material at their own pace and they have access to all the study sources that are available to them. Having this opportunity will allow student's grades to be high and they will have a smaller chance at failing.

The work environment a student is presented with matters a lot. Meaning the resources and atmosphere they are in reflects on their test scores and quizzes as well. Sitting in a work environment where there is no access to basic resources will effect greatly on students. Sitting somewhere where students can not sit comfortably will not show pleasant grades. Sitting somewhere uncomfortable will not help with focusing on what is being taught, because your mind will only think about how uncomfortable you really are and then results in you missing what was taught and then ending in you getting a bad grade on the test/quiz. Even when sitting in a cold room. If you are sitting in a cold room all you will think about is how cold you are and how you wish you were someplace warm so you would not freezing your legs off. The environment you are in when learning matters because if the atmosphere presented is terrible then the test and quiz scores will show the same.

Online classes will be a very beneficial option to students. With online classes as an option students will be able to focus more, students will be able to go at their own pace to learn the material, and students will now be sitting in an environment that makes them comfortable to sit in so they will be able to succeed more.

Going and seeing different countries is something you would never do in your life but, if you sign up you will be able to go and see things that you would only see in pictures. Going to these countries is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

You get to get them cows , chickens ,etc, to help them farm and get better meals. Getting people food saves their life and betters it. It is not as easy as going out to the store and buying food that you need. They have to farm and grow crops to eat. Giving people food that they need gives you a warm fuzzy feeling.

The third reason that you should sign up is that while your on water you get to relax and get away from loud city noises. Getting away from the city for awile is good, you get to figure out how to live away from the city. Also you get to relax and just hear the sound of water hitting the sand.

9B5E878ED861,"Everyone would like to receive praise for their work, even if the work is not their best effort, that will make them not to think low of themselves and just give up. In my opinion, true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives an individual determination, and self confidence.

Although, some people believe that self-esteem comes from an achievement because it gives self-discipline; for instance, a student did a poor job on a classroom test , that means he is not receiving any praise and didn't achieve anything, but because of that he will be self-discipline, so he would do a good job next time and receive an achievement.

I think true self-esteem come from praise because it gives an individual determination. For example, if a student gets a non pleasant grade in class, and the teacher praises the student but also tell him to do better next time, that would give the student hope and determination to do better next time.

In addition, true self-esteem comes from self-confidence. For instance, I am in a soccer club, but every time we practice I don't do better because I don't have the confidence, but instead of the coach cutting me off the team, he came up to me and told me that I can do better. He praised me and courage me to do better. That is going me to build self-confident in me and I would start doing better during practice.

According to my reason and examples stated above, I think true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives a student determination and help build self-confidence in a student.

Principal (last name),

With all do respect I am against your idea of not letting kids play sports if they are not on a B average. I don't think it's fair because a B average means ""good"". A C average is average. If a student has an average letter grade they should still be able to play or participate in sports. My reason is a student could easily fail in a class if they didn't care. But, if a student has a C average letter grade then it means that the student is showing that him or her is at least having to show some effort. Rather It's doing homework, doing good on test/quizzes, or even getting a decent grade on in-class work.

When you take away sports from students, you are taking away some students time to be active and express themselves. Also when you take away sports you could be taking away a students social time with peers. I am asking you to please reconsider your rule of letting students play sports unless they have a B average grade. Thank you for your time to read this letter

If driveless cars do become the new thing to have, what would the driver do? The driver would simply stop paying attention to the road, and the car would do everything for them. With the car doing everything for them, more drivers would focus their energy and attention somewhere else, causing more accidents. With more accidents, who would be at fault? Would it be the driver, or the company?

How will the laws be made in order to keep others safe if the car happens to break down? With actuall drivers driving a car their attention, and energy is on the road they're driving on. If they do cause an accident, there's cars that are made to prevent an accident before it happens.

96AA147B4819,"Laughing, having fun, new friends, new hobbies. These are just the few benefits from joining extracurricular activities in school. Some schools make students participate in extracurricular activities giving them the advantage to all these benefits. All students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

One reason why all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because has students get to know new people. A recent article from Generic_School's PTA daily updates have shown that 27% of their students didn't know every one of their classmates. Ever since they established that extracurricular activities are mandatory that percentage has rapidly gone down to 9%. This means that adding in these activities made students get closer to knowing each other. If Generic_School didn't set these rules then what would happen to each student. Maybe there are many kids who don't have someone to talk to but after these boundaries were set they have someone there for them. Not setting these rule on having extracurricular activities have big impacts on student and this can't happen.

Another reason why all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because it develops stronger social skills. Alex Freeman a professional psychologist reports ""Kids that I have worked with usually don't do any type of social activities what so ever making them not have the capability of carrying a conversation and decreasing the chance on improving social skills."" In other words these kids who don't do any type of activity have not made any change in socializing and creating conversation. By not including these activities it may bring some of their students down. Adding them on the other hand will one help out with social skills and two will benefit the kids all through out their life. With the disadvantage of no extracurricular activities what will become of our kids if they don't have what they need? What will happen to society if we don't have the ability to even speak to another person?

In addition to why all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because of money. A report from the Generic_School states ""2 out of 10 student parents don't have the money to afford extra activities outside of school due to numerous of reasons."" This shows how some kids can't really get to those activities like other kids due to money problems. If schools do add these extracurricular activities then these student parents don't have to worry about spending extra money. By not making this mandatory what could happen to the less fortunate families who are in need of some extra money?

Others may say that we should not have extracurricular activities because it pushes student boundaries. A student survey from the Wisconsin Department of Student Learning shows that 12% of all students in the state say that when the school makes certain rules mandatory many of the kids say that it's pushing past their limit and forcing them to do something they don't want to do. This means that a small portion of kids feel like if the school makes them do extracurricular activities it's a invasion to their limit. I don't disagree with this but that's just one bad reason out of many good reasons. While it's just 12% that say its a invasion to their privacy theres still the other 88% who think it would be fun and is a good idea. Knowing that more than half of students think it's a good idea really shows that making it mandatory to have extracurricular activities have a greater impact on the students than not having it.

Having to participate in at least on extracurricular activity should be a requirement for all students. Not only that it helps other student get to know each other better it also improves social skills and helps save money for student parents. Some may disagree that we should add extracurricular activities but they are wrong. Extracurricular activities provide multiple benefits to each student making this a must to schools. Having this be requirement for each school it just can't magically become apart of the system we need to start somewhere. For a starters, start by contacting your local school board of supervisors to give them the idea and hope that it will be passed on. We need to make this happen for your kids and the other generations to come sake but we need to start from the ground up; and thats with you.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

For example, a person who starts a catering business can become a master chef, able to create delicious dishes and efficiently run a successful catering business. Gaining mastery in a specific business area is beneficial in that a person can become an authority in a particular field. 

However, another approach a business owner might take is to take on multiple tasks and grow through experience. For example, a restaurant owner might gain knowledge and experience related to real estate, food sourcing, marketing, and personnel. By taking on roles outside of the core business skills, the restaurant owner can gain knowledge in a variety of areas, knowledge which can in turn lead to more creative and innovative ideas. 

It is important for a business owner to stay on top of knowledge and experiences related to their business in order to remain diverse and competitive. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” In business, it is important to think outside the box, to develop ideas and create solutions that are unique and innovative.

That schools offer distance learning as a option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferesing.

First of all online schools will benefit all students. because,this way they won't have excuses to be tardy,they will also have more energy to complete their asignments. This way they will have more time for all of their subjects and no excuses because they had enouph time to gain energy to work on all of their subjects.

Second If students go to online schools their will be less trafic on the roads,People will be able to get on time to their jobs since they will be no buses causing traffic,online schools may be beneficial to all those who are always late to work and they will be less accidents.

Some my argue that online schools will not be beneficial because teachers,bus drivers and janators may loose their jobs online schools migth benefit students but it won't benefit schools staff's.

Finally although Students might benefit from online schools it may be better, If they still attend to regular schools so that way they will know how to sociolaize and interract with others. online schools should apply when they're snow days or problems with the weather so that way students will not get behind and always be caugth up in all of their subjects.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
CEFDC545C24F,"Hey there! 

So, I know some people might be thinking, ""Ugh, a longer school day? No way, man! That's like, way too long!"" But hear me out. 

I think having a longer school day could be really beneficial for high school students. Like, think about it. We're already in school for like, eight hours a day, but sometimes it feels like we're not getting enough time to learn everything we need to know.  I mean, have you seen some of these kids' faces when they're trying to learn new stuff? It's like they're trying to drink from a firehose! 

So, if we had more time in school, we could actually learn more stuff. Like, imagine being able to get more help from teachers, or having more time to work on projects and stuff. It could be really great for our grades and stuff.  And who doesn't want better grades, right? 

But, I know some people might be thinking, ""But won't it be super annoying to be in school for longer? Like, won't we just be sitting around all day?"" And yeah, I get that.  But, think about it this way: if we have more time in school, we could actually have more fun. Like, imagine being able to play games or do cool projects during class. It could be like, a nice break from the usual boring stuff. 

And, I don't know about you guys, but I feel like I'm always forgetting stuff.  Like, I'll be in class and I'll be like, ""Oh no, I forgot to do that homework!"" Or, ""I forgot to study for that test!"" And it's just,  super frustrating. But, if we had more time in school, maybe we could actually remember stuff better. 

But, I guess there are some downsides too.  Like, some people might be like, ""Ugh, I don't want to be",1,llama2_chat,Task: Research the advantages and disadvantages of having a longer school day for high school students.

04AF157D14EA,"Students should be told to do at least one extracurricular at school because doing an extracurricular can help students become more physically healthy, they can leave a lasting impression on their school and they can meet new people. All these can come from doing an extracurricular activity after school. I agree with this decision by the principal since most pupils will have good outcomes by doing an extracurricular activity. Students have a wide range of choices for their activity for example, students could choose to participate in sports such as baseball or basketball, work in the math club, the model U.N.

All the clubs you can think of the school most likely provides for their students to choose, however out of all the good reasons to force students to participate in these extra activities do have some setbacks. Some of these setbacks include the fact that maybe some students have responsibilities after school such as babysitting, jobs or religious reasons.

First, Students who choose to be apart of clubs such as the Student Government or National Junior Honor Society can revolutionize their school and create change in rules that they do not favor as much as other rules. These clubs usually encourage free thinkers and people who wanna to create change and revitalize their school when it gets a little stale and boring. Some kids might join a sports team or musical ensemble and win a championship or a musical trophy that the school can proudly display like all the other trophies that the school has won. Most schools are very proud of their pupil's accomplishments in or out of school usually displaying their accomplishments such as their students who went to the NBA like Kobe Bryant or became very famous actors like Tom Cruise.

Nelson Mandela once said, ""Education is the key to life and happiness"" and if that is true partially extracurricular can help you achieve that. As most colleges look at your application form they look at your Grades ACT and SAT but what they also look at is what extracurricular you are in such as clubs, sports teams or musical acts such as a band or ensemble.

Next, students can become more physically healthy and fit when doing some activities after school. The main example of that is a school sports team that the students can join like track or swimming can help them lead a healthy lifestyle and lose weight while filling their requirements to do a school extracurricular activity. These school sanctioned activities can help students become more fit and lose weight because of the sport. Sports in general are a good way to teach kids to be healthy and not sit at home all day and lay in bed or on a couch all day after school. Kids are easily impressionable to anything or anyone that tells them what they like such as a junk food commercial or a commercial for sugary cereal, these commercials tell them that the cereal that they are marketing is healthy but in reality it is just a sugary full of carbohydrates cereal. By letting kids stay after and teaching them what foods are healthy for them or not we can reduce the impact that childhood obesity has caused the last couple of years.

Lastly, most students who participate in after school activities can meet a lot of new people who are interested in the same things as you are and you can talk to them in the clubs or other activities you have joined. Most people who join clubs are often interested in the same things as everyone else in that club, there even some clubs just about certain interests such as the anime club which is just a club for kids who like anime or manga. Other clubs and extracurricular are also good places to meet new people if you are new to a school and need people to talk to.

these friends you make can become lifelong friends of yours even out of school and into college or the workforce and adulthood. These bonds that you make in middle school and high school can increase your social skills and help you with life skills like communication with other people, a skill needed in jobs like marketing where you most likely need to present in front of other people sometimes including your boss.

In conclusion, being told to do one extracurricular by your school isn't the end of the world you can make it fun by choosing a club or sport that you enjoy to do and it will not be a burden on you or your family. In these extra activities you can create a better you and show your school that, you can become healthier and you can always meet new people who share common interests with you. All the students are required to do an extracurricular most likely because the school just wants the best for you and your academic career whether that is from K-12 or beyond to college and the workforce extracurricular help you in many ways throughout your life, these clubs ensembles and teams can boost your self confidence, fortify your social skills while you have fun since you have chosen things that interest you and are not boring.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

llama_70b_v11064,"I think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home through distance learning. There are several reasons why this is the case.

Firstly, distance learning provides students with the flexibility to learn at their own pace. Some students may learn better in the morning, while others may learn better in the evening. With distance learning, students can attend classes at a time that suits them best, which can improve their learning outcomes.

Secondly, distance learning can be especially helpful for students who live in remote areas or have mobility issues. For example, students who live in rural areas may not have access to quality education near their homes. With distance learning, they can attend classes from home and still receive a quality education. Similarly, students with mobility issues may find it difficult to attend classes in a physical classroom. distance learning provides them with an opportunity to attend classes from the comfort of their own homes.

Thirdly, distance learning can reduce the risk of absenteeism. Sometimes, students may miss classes due to illness, transportation issues, or other reasons. With distance learning, students can still attend classes from home and avoid missing important lessons.

Finally, distance learning can provide students with access to a wider range of courses. Some schools may not offer certain courses due to a lack of resources or qualified teachers. With distance learning, students can access courses that may not be available at their local school.

However, it's important to note that distance learning also has its drawbacks. For example, students may struggle with self-motivation and discipline, as they may not have the same level of structure and accountability as they would in a physical classroom. Additionally, technology issues can sometimes arise, such as connectivity problems or poor audio quality.

Overall, I believe that distance learning can be a valuable option for students who want to attend classes from home. It provides flexibility, accessibility, and the potential for a wider range of courses. However, it's important for schools to ensure that distance learning students receive the support they need to succeed, such as access to teachers and resources, and that technology issues are minimized as much as possible.",1,llama_70b_v1,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

9D0665A39328,"Seeking advice from different people can be helpful, because it can expand upon your view of a topic.

A person asking for advice will sometimes ask multiple people for advice, to get different opinions on a topic

These opinions can either help the person with learning about a topic or they could just be receiving incorrect information. This can also lead to the person becoming confused about the topic and ultimately fail to resolve their topic. And while they are confused the could be led to do the wrong thing and lead to worse consequences.

But they can also gather a lot of correct information which would help with opening them up to more choices, if given the correct information. Getting advice from multiple people can also lead to choices that benefit more people or just a more open minded decision. These decisions can really affect the outlook of someones topic, for somebody giving a person incorrect advice could lead to a horrible decision.

But most importantly while seeking advice you should seek multiple inputs to decide which one is the best fit, so when you make your final choice its the best one. Making sure the advice you get is credible is also easier when you ask multiple people because of similar advice.

falcon_180b_v1_179,"I believe that homework is an essential part of learning because it helps students practice and review what they learned in class. Homework also helps students develop good study habits and time management skills. However, I do understand that sometimes too much homework can put unnecessary stress on students. Therefore, I think that teachers should assign a reasonable amount of homework and consider the workload of other classes.

Firstly, homework is an essential part of learning because it helps students practice and review what they learned in class. When students do homework, they can reinforce the concepts they learned and gain a better understanding of the material. For example, when I was learning how to solve equations in math class, I found that practicing at home with homework assignments really helped me master the skill. If I had not done the homework, I would not have understood the concept fully.

Secondly, homework helps students develop good study habits and time management skills. By setting aside time to complete assignments, students learn how to prioritize their work and manage their time effectively. This skill is important because it can be applied throughout their academic career and even in their professional lives. For instance, when I have a lot of homework, I make a schedule to ensure that I complete all my tasks in a timely manner.

However, it is important to note that too much homework can put unnecessary stress on students. If a teacher assigns excessive homework, students may become overwhelmed and stressed, which can have negative effects on their mental and physical health. Therefore, I think that teachers should consider the workload of other classes and assign a reasonable amount of homework. For example, if I have an exam in another subject coming up, I would appreciate it if my math teacher assigned less homework for that week.

In conclusion, while homework is an essential part of learning, teachers should ensure that they assign a reasonable amount of it so that students do not become overwhelmed and stressed. With the appropriate amount of homework, students can develop good study habits and time management skills, while also reinforcing the concepts they learn in class.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Some people argue that homework is an essential part of learning, while others believe it puts unnecessary stress on students.

6CA261D9ABFF,"The system by which America elects its president is neither democratic nor fair. It favors small states, could possibly elect the loser of the popular vote, and discourages minority voters.

In many states, the electors who vote for president are not required to vote for who won in the state they represent, says Plumer. An elector could decide, ""I dont like who won, so I'll vote for this other candidate"". One could say, since a party will choose its electors, that it will hardly ever happen, says Posner. It's true, but it shouldn't ever be able to happen, and it has happened. Plumer points out, that several times in America's past, electors have defied the will of the people. It is impossible to be completely sure of someone's loyalty.

Another problem is that it is possible to win enough electoral votes to become president, but not enough of the actual population's vote to have won the popular vote, argues Plumer. Because senatorial seats count towards a state's electoral votes, and the fact that each state gets 2 Senators, no matter their population, more populated states' votes are technically stolen by less populated ones through the Senate. The Electoral College essentiallty has a skewed view of population distribution. Winning a majority of the popular vote in smaller states will give you slightly more electoral votes for population than larger ones. In most cases though, a candidate will win both the electoral and popular vote, says Posner. While that is the case msot of the time, people would not accept the possibility that in, say, a sports game, the loser might randomly win because of the system used to determine it. It is arguably more important that a country is run by the correct person.

Posner claims that the Electoral College prevents a third party jumping in and grabbing enough votes prevent either ""big party"" candidate from winning. While in a truly direct vote, this could happen, the Electoral College allows for the same exact problem. If a third party candidate manages to win the election in just a few states, he could steal enough electoral votes that no candidate manages to get the 270 votes needed for a victory. Plumer warns that ""most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"". A tie, with both candidates getting 269 votes, would be solved in the same way as a third party getting enough votes that no one manages to get over 269. The House of Representatives would vote on the president. Here, the bigger states are again cheated of their power, as the delegates for as states, and not individuals. Wyoming's sole representative has as much sway as the 55 from California. On top of this unfairness, the delegates do not have to vote as the states have. If a majority Republican state were to have a majority Democratic representation, the state could very possibly end up voting in the candidate of the opposite party. As the Electoral College was created at the creation of the nation itself, and the president and vice-president didn't campaign together, the Senate chooses the vice-president, indpependantly. If the Senate and House are are opposite parties, the president and vice-president could end up being from opposite parties. Plumer gives the examples of 1968 and 1976, where ""a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election,"" and ""a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way,"" respectively.

Posner addresses the argument that the Electoral College discourages voters of the opposite party of a state dominated by the other party from voting. He says ""no voter's vote swings a national election... Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a politcal preference, rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."" That view is what causes people to not vote. Even 1% of America's population would be three million people, and among those three million, there are without a doubt, people who believed that lie that their vote doesn't matter. Plumer's examples of the elections of 1968 and 1976, referenced earlier, are prime examples of times where just about 1% of that 1% of the population's votes were needed to change the possible outcome of the election.

The Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system. The fact that it even has the possibility to essentially make the loser win should be enough of a reason to abolish it in favor of something like a true majority wins election. On top of possible ""failure"", the Electoral College pretends that more people live where they dont, and less people live where they do, and discourages minority voters from even voting, especially if they're in a larger state, an extreme minority, or a combination of the two.

60ED0B48B8F2,"In his essay ""Self-Reliance"", Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""The great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude."" This statement captures the essence of the idea of being alone in the world – that is, one can be surrounded by people, yet remain independent and content despite the lack of connection with them.

Nevertheless, while Emerson's words might suggest that it is possible to do something meaningful without the help and support of others, this idea is unrealistic in practice. Human beings rely on each other for countless things - whether it is emotional support, advice, or practical assistance in achieving something. In this sense, going it alone is rarely a viable option, and as such, it is difficult to do something meaningful without the help and support of others.

At the same time, this does not mean that it is impossible to do something meaningful alone. In fact, there are many examples of individuals who have made significant contributions without any sort of supportive network. One could argue that learning to rely on oneself could be a meaningful achievement in its own right. Therefore, while it is true that living a life without the help and support of others is more difficult, it is not impossible.

When we are given opportunities to make our own decisions and pursue what we find interesting or fulfilling, we open up many new doors that the world can't offer.

06F5F6A09DC6,"More than one person's advice

Have you ever wondered or questioned yourself why do you have to ask more than one person's for advice? Yep you heard me. People from all around the world ask advice about anything. That could be video games, schools, and even Life. Obviously, there are many other things to ask advice. It's kind of asking for help, you can say. People incuding kids, teens, and even adults are asking advice that could help them in the furture, you guys even might have connections, and more than one person. More than one is better than just asking for one person's advice.

Having connections

The people you ask for advice were kids too just like you and they possibly ran into what you are stuck or struggling at right now. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. That's either with struggles at school, home, family members, or even life. I almost forgot to include decisions because small decisions can eventually become big decisions. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. I mean you can ask seniors but they most likely will forget everything since they were kids. The worst thing you can do is asking someone young even a 18 year old adult because you never know what happened in them. Trust and worthy friends you can ask but friends that you just say hi to once a day or even a week wouldn't be so great.

Help in the future

Advices not just help from the presents but in the future as well. According to my calculations you could use that advice over and over again. For example, let's say you didn't know where you put a comma in a sentence, therefore, you used a person's advice and it was to put a and where ever you were going to put the comma at. You can also use it to help your kids and even grandsons if you still remember.

More than one person's advice

Last but not least, why more than one person's advice you ask. One advice can help and even solve whatever you have in mind but you actually want to check if they were right. You probably want to gather the information and rethink it. Everyone in my opinion should at most ask two people for advice just to make sure. First person person wasn't being that specific enough so you decide to go to another person. If they haven't been specific enough then just go to another person. I mean how hard is that? Especially kids since they have just started growing up and will soon become young adults.

Everybody should be struggling something in a certain time of life that they ask for advice. Don't be shy for asking advice and you believe in yourself that you are a brave and confedent man that doesn't need help. Because really you will be a better one for asking advice. Therefore, the reason that we ask advice is to become someone better each day by taking that advice.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
B7BD520BE938,"Sometimes having to make a decision is pretty hard thats why we ask for advice from some people. Seeking multiple opinions can help with making a better choice because seeing other viewpoints on the topic may help , having other viewpoints can also help with making a decision and lastly, it can help with having the feeling of assurance that you went with the right decision.

Making a better choice may sometimes always need the advice of other people, this is because people that need to make a decision want to see other viewpoints on the topic. When having to make a decision its better to see other viewpoints because some people speak from experience to help the person making the choice. Some people give their opinions based off of what they think would be better for yourself and your future. Lastly, some people may give pros and cons of each choice to help the person making the decision.

Seeking multiple opinions can help make a better choice by helping you make a decision . Other opinions can help you choose because if multiple people give the same type of advice on what you should choose you should go with it. Although, you may think what if they're lying or what they say may not be accurate, the most important thing is to go with your gut feeling and if you do have the same opinion or idea as the person your talking with you should always go for it. At times when your not feeling the best connection with the advice you were given you should go with the other choice, there is never a requirement that you have to go with the advice your given when your not feeling it.

When getting advice from multiple people its important to keep in mind when decision making because it can influence the decision you want to make. The reason as to why people want multiple opinions on a topic is because they want to have an assurance that whatever advice one person gave you is good and can agree with what someone else was thinking or even yourself. When seeking for multiple opinions we always keep in mind what would be beneficial from making a certain choice.

Seeing viewpoints from others, having assurance that advice you are given is good and beneficial, and lastly can help make a decision are all reasons why people seek advice and opinions from multiple people. These reasons are main reasons why most people seek multiple opinions and use to make a choice. ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
D1A866170CEA,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? There is a debate if students would benefit or not from online classes? Some people believe that students would do better if their classes are at home. I believe that you can learn more if you are in a regular class than just being at home because students can learn from other cultures or more things about life with other friends, if students do not interact with others in a future they are going to be afraid to do it, and finally if you are in a regular school you can do more activities and share with your friends.

First, when you are in a school of the united states you learn a lot from other cultures. Therefore besides than world geography, you learn from your friends countries and how is to live there. Also, when you have friends at school you share your problems and most of the time you learn more things about life with them and how you can be a better person.

Second, sometimes there can be shy people at school because they do not know how to interact with others or how to start a conversation. When you do activities in groups sometimes you make new friends and talk to others became easily than before. However, if students do not learn how to talk to others in public places they are going to be afraid in a future; imagine if they need to make a presentation at work, they are not going to be able to do it because they will be afraid to talk in front of all the co-workers. Learn how to interact with others is important for your future.

Third, it is important to get involve in activities at school; activities help you with your curriculum when you apply to college. Also, if you are in any activity you can share more with your friends. However, when you get involved with activities at school helps you to clear your mind when you have to many homework or when you are stress out about your classes. Therefore, some of the activities give a lot of skills in the thing that you would like to do in your future.

In conclusion, if students do not interact with others or neither have a friend to talk with, and they do not have activities to get involved with other people; students are not going to be successful if they try in a future to interact with a large group of people. Therefore, it is very important to learn from others and interact at your school. That is why I believe that everybody should take classes on a regular school, to learn how to get involved with others and be able to express your self.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
D69416DBA6F4,"Do we want stress, sadness, and a constant rush in students of the school? No! Then there shouldn't be an idea of making all students participate in an extracurricular activity. If the students want to participate, then they can. Forcing them to participate, however, isn't right. I disagree with having all students participate in extracurricular activities because the school would be crowded, homework time would be decreased for students, and students who are already in a club or program outside of school would have to rush to or even quit the activity that they are enrolled in.

Firstly, with everyone trying to get into the activities, the school would become crowded. Hundreds of students would attempt to get into a variety of clubs. If a specific club, though, is very popular, then with all the students trying to get in, the space would be limited. The students who are rejected from the group might not have another club that they are willing to join, but they will have to find one. This can lead to sadness, anger, jealousy to other people who got in, and other bad feelings. Bad cases of these feelings can lead to stress, fights, and even broken friendships.

Another con of this idea is a loss of time to complete homework. For students who may receive lots of homework, having to do extracurricular activities, other things at home, and the homework can cause stress and also cause students to stay up late and lose sleep time. With all of this, the students could possibly forget about their homework and their grades will drop because of it. With all of these things, the students won't have time to relax at home after a long day. Without proper sleep at night, the students could fall asleep in class and get in trouble. The cycle will continue and the students in the school won't be attentive enough to learn anything in their classes.

Last but not least, students who already participate in activities outside of school will have problems. They will have to rush to attend their activities, or have to quit because they will never have time to attend the activity. This could also cause stress because they could have to rush to activities that are usually much smoother and easier to attend. They could like their activity more than the schools' activity but have to quit it. Then they will be able to attend the school activity, but have to give up the activity they like more. That is wrong and a student should never be put in that situation.

People who support the principals idea may say things like ""the more activities, the better"", or ""now the students have things to do with their friends"",but the students should have freedom over what they do. At least, if anything, contact the students' parents and ask them for approval. Don't just force them to, though, because it's not right to force students to participate in any activities that they aren't interested in doing. With this, I believe that the students should have the freedom to choose and not have to participate in any activity if they aren't intrigued.

In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the idea of making all students participate in extracurricular activities. If the students want to participate, then they can. If they don't want to participate or join, then they shouldn't have to. With how crowded it would be, the loss of homework time it would bring, and stress causing it would create, I don't believe that students should be forced into that. I believe the students should be given the choice, and if some of them don't accept, try to convince others. Instead of making them all participate, ask them what activities they like and improve the clubs or create new clubs based on their opinions. Forcing them to participate, however, is wrong!",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Recently, NASA unveiled an image of a landform on Mars that looks like a human face. Some people believe that it a real face of an alien and make conspiracy theories about the face and spread it throughout the public. Even though that the ""face on Mars"" is just a rock landform shaped like a human face.

Firstly, humans would not be able to survive on Mars. The gases and lack of oxygen would kill them. The reality is that the picture is an actual human or alien face is just made up by conspiracy theorists . NASA has revealed this to the public so that they could some attention to mars.""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars (3).They just wanted conspiracy theorist to make people think that there was some sort of ancient civilization on Mars or some kind of aliens. Which was proven not to exist.

After NASA getting all attention on Mars from the ""Face on Mars"" debate, they went back upto space to see if they could capture more photos. NASA was using high-tech cameras to prove their theory of seeing a human face. ""MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when then image first appeared on JPL website, revealing... a natrual landform(7)."" The face is just a landform not an alien monument nor a human face.

Later on, after taking the pictures of the proven landform on Mars, the topic started to quite down. Some conspiracy theorist still spread their theories to the public. This is all how NASA researches foreign landforms on other planets. They take their camera satillites and capture a picture of the landform and continue to study it. NASA uses the knowledge they have about Earth to study the landforms on other planets. ""It reminds me most of the Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, say Garvin. That's a lava dome that takes place from an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars (12)."" The process just starts all over again.

After looking at all the scientific knowlege, you can conclude that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform. NASA does this so that they can get public attention about their research, until the theory is proven wrong. It is just like any other buisness that wants publicity. Aliens are currently proven to not exist, so most people like to try to change that theory whenever they find a small peice,of what could be eveidence.

I do not think the school is aloud to do that. I mean the only reason the principal would do that is to make the school more notice able than it already.

It doesn't make sense to me to push us more to something others would call impossible. The school district or oh ever suggested that needs to talk to kids like me . The schools have those kids that don't try or care but don't push them or kids like me becasas all its going to do is make things worse.

5D8E6B28C99F,"Many schools have begun to offer distance learning as a way for students to attend classes from home by using online resources and video conferences. These online classes offer more ways for students to learn, and they are a more accessible option for many parents and students. In this day and age, many students participate in extracurricular activities, such as sports, volunteer work, clubs, etc. with all of these activities going on in an average student's life, they lose time for both homework and their friends. Distance learning programs can help fix this problem by allowing students to learn on their own schedule and not having to travel so much between school and their other activities.

Students would benefit from distance learning, as it would help students manage their time more effectively and leave more time for other activities.

As a student, I participate in a few extracurricular activities, it is practically a necessity to get into a good college these days. I play two different sports and work a job at a local fast food chain, between practice and work, I typically only have a 1-2 hours a day to focus on anything other than school, work, or practice. On days where I have a sports game or an important test to prepare for, those 1-2 hours are non-existent. I am one of many students who experience this problem, and I believe distance learning can help combat this issue. With distance learning, I won't have to waste an hour or two of my day by traveling between school and my other activities. Plus, maintaining a good sleep schedule would be much easier, as more time would be available to sleep, therefore making it easier to learn by not being so tired constantly. Simply put, by offering distance learning, managing time and sleep becomes much easier to do, and with that come the benefits of being more focused when it is time to learn.

Distance learning also allows students to set a manageable schedule of their learning. In the current classroom environment, everyone has to go at the same pace as everyone else. If the subject comes very easy to an individual, than he will quickly find himself bored and tired in that class. On the other hand, if it is a very difficult subject for him, he won't be able to comprehend the important concepts in the same time frame of a student who is good at that subject. With prerecorded lectures and the ability to schedule as many classes as one thinks they need on a subject, students can set their own pace for learning and learn a lot more effectively. It is extremely important that everyone gets an education, but some may need more time or help than others, distance learning is part of the solution to this problem.

Some people may argue that students can not be trusted with the ability to set there own schedule and that many will just stop scheduling classes and learning all together. I disagree, many students hate coming to school, but will still skip classes even knowing the consequences that it will bring in the future. It is because some students dread coming to school so much that distance learning would work for them. With the help of a counselor to help work out an effective plan for learning, kids won't dread school so much, because they can now learn from home in a comfortable environment at their own pace.

That is why distance learning is a great program that should be encouraged throughout school systems. It allows students to manage their time much easier, provides better pacing for learning, and creates a comfortable environment for students. Some may abuse the ability of not having to actually show up at a designated location for class, but students skip class anyways in a regular classroom environment, and distance learning will help reduce that problem if anything. That is why I believe it is a good idea for all schools to start assimilating distance learning, at least to some extent, into their education systems.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
7489B153118D,"Dear principle,

I believe that the average grade to participate in a sport should be a C because it is not fair for students who depend on sports to have a good future. They shouldn't be denied that privilege because a C is still passing. Also because many students may not have the capability to maintain a higher grade, but can play a sport very well. Not all great sports legends started off by getting great grades. By not allowing them to take a sport you might be denying a child to have a future later on, as we all know many people play high school sports to get into college to become a professional. By not allowing them to play you are making it tough for them to move on in life and in education. you are making a clear statement to students all over the school that they aren't good enough to play any type of sport at all. To many children sports are always a way to take their minds off of tough decisions or private situations. Without that time to work with a team productively many children will not know how to communicate socially with other people. without the experience many children will lack the ability to communicate with others.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
C2E37AE20F8E,"Students need a break from school. Continuing through twelve years of standardized education without the occasional recess would be detrimental to the mental health of all involved parties (including the teachers). That being said, breaks from school should not be periods where students are completely free of the learning they undergo during the school year. To ensure this, students are often given graded projects to complete over their breaks. However, the way in which these projects should be administered is a point of contention. Some believe these projects should be created by teachers, others believe the students themselves should be making their own assignments. Because it is the most effective way to prepare for the upcoming course, and it is the best way to ensure all projects can be graded fairly and objectively, teachers should be the ones designing the projects students take over their breaks.

I've seen a joke circiling around the internet around back-to-school time for a couple of years now. It describes how as one walks into their math class on the first day of school, the teacher will frantacially start off the class by exclaiming ""alright everybody we're already behind schedule"". Although this is meant to be comedic, it certainly bears parallels to reality. Often teachers simply do not have enough class time to get through all the material by the end of the year. This causes the class to be rushed, and does not allow for the teacher to allocate more time to areas where students are struggling. Having teachers design projects to be completed before students arrive on the first day of class is a way to mitigate this problem. Teachers, who know the curriculum well and truly understand what topics might need more focus, can design a project that introduces the students to material they actually need to know. This relieves the stress and pressure put on students and teachers alike, as the students enter the classrooms for the first time already familiar with the material. Accomplishing this with a student-designed project would not be as successful, as anyone unfamiliar with course-material is not going to be able to create a project that prepares someone for that very course-material. Teachers are the only ones that can effectively design a project that prepares students for their upcoming course.

Personal bias has no place in education. Teachers try to avoid this from coming into play by issuing objective markers of student performance: grades. However, grades only work if they are truly objective. Therefore, educators must use a standarized rubric to assess all of their students. This is practically impossible to do if students can design their own project. If a student has the freedom to take as many liberties as he or she desires with a graded assignment, it is almost impossible for any teacher to then compare every students' projects to one another, or even to some basic model. My eighth grade science teacher ran into this very problem. My class was given an assignment with very little direction and practically no rubric. This made it very difficult for us to understand what we were supposed to get out of the assignment. Additionally, many of us thought we were graded unfairly for the project. I realize now that these conclusions were inevitable because this was a student-designed project. The teacher was unable to fairly assess our work because the project lacked structure. It is unfair for both students and teachers alike to have students design their own projects, as it is practically impossible to grade them objectively and fairly.

Long summer breaks can often prove to be detrimental to a student's education. Teachers often try to avoid this outcome by assigning projects over this period of rest. However, this raises the question of who should be the ones designing these projects: teachers or students? Because it is the most effective way to prepare for the upcoming course, and it is the best way to ensure all projects can be graded fairly and objectively, teachers should be the ones designing the projects students take over their breaks.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
B9733BDA883E," High school is a crucial time in a person's life, as it marks the transition from middle school to college or beyond. While many people believe that high school is a time to focus solely on academics, there are other classes that offer unique benefits that cannot be found in traditional subjects. These classes, such as arts, music, and drama, provide students with opportunities to socialize, communicate, and express themselves creatively.

In high school, students are often under a lot of pressure to perform well academically and prepare for college. This can be overwhelming and stressful, especially for those who struggle in certain subjects. However, classes like arts, music, and drama can provide a much-needed break from the rigors of traditional academics. These classes offer a chance to relax and have fun with friends, while also learning valuable social and communication skills.

For example, a shy and introverted student who has never had the confidence to speak up in class may find that participating in a drama or music class gives them the opportunity to express themselves creatively and build their self-confidence. These classes provide a safe space for students to explore their talents and interests, without the pressure of traditional academic expectations.

Moreover, these classes can also teach students valuable social skills that they may not learn in other subjects. For instance, music and drama classes require students to work together in groups, which can help them develop teamwork and collaboration skills. Additionally, these classes often involve public performances, which can help students develop public speaking and communication skills.

While some may argue that these classes are a waste of time, there is evidence to suggest that they can have a positive impact on a student's academic performance and overall well-being. For example, a study conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts found that students who participated in arts education were more likely to excel in other subjects, such as math and science, and were less likely to drop out of school.

In conclusion, while high school is a time to focus on academics, there are other classes that offer unique benefits that cannot be found in traditional subjects. Classes like arts, music, and drama provide students with opportunities to socialize, communicate, and express themselves creatively. These classes can also teach valuable social skills and have a positive impact on a student's academic performance and overall well-being.

B60BD5B9D118,"Traveling to school has become a hassle to students. With transportation being limited to the person's zone, many have found it very difficult to attend school. Now that technology has advance, though, it has made it easier to learn and teach certain individuals that may not be able to make it to their classes by video conferencing. At home learning is offered at some schools, which help many students that could not make it to their classes. Students would benefit from online conferencing because they would be able to attend classes on time and they would not have to worry about transportation.

Although some may disagree by saying students would most likely wake up late and not even do the actual video call, most of the high schoolers have became accustomed to wake up early. From interviewing students, at least eighty-five percent have claim to wake up at a very specific time. As they have been waking up at a certain time, it has become a habit that benefits them to attend they classes with this form of education. This body alarm clock that everyone will certainly help students be on time to call for their instructors.

Students always worry about their transportation. While some buses come on time or early, others come very late or not at all, which causes an obstacle for many that do want learn. This has been a major problem that students have no control of whatsoever. The opportunity to stay at home to attend classes without worrying about if bus 69 has arrived could make an abundance of student's learning experience easier. While many may argue that student should provide their own ride, it should be noted that most wait to get their license at the age of 18. That is around the time that most will graduate. Even if they have their parent or guardian to drop them off, it pays a heavy price to the driver who may have a job that requires them clock in early. Which is why an online call is a better option for students.

The obstacles that students must endure to travel to school has become tremendously difficult. The option to learn from the comfort at home is very stress relieving. Students would not have to worry about waking up early for a bus that might not even be there because an online conference would help them succeed academically. Attending classes would be so much easier with this alternative teaching method.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Our principal emphasizes the importance of students participating in at least one activity, and after seeing the positive impact it had on the student who won the prize, I agree with this decision.

Participating in school activities can help students build relationships with their peers. Whether they are new or old students, they can find new friends and expand their social circle. It can also help them overcome shyness and boost their self-confidence.

Additionally, school activities can provide students with valuable skills and experiences that can help them excel in their future careers. For example, students who are good at art or sports can showcase their talents in art shows or competitions and potentially earn a college degree in those fields.

Moreover, school activities can help students discover their passions and interests. Students may have hidden talents that they are not aware of, and participating in activities can help them explore and develop these skills.

D78CE4181BE8,"I belive the driverless cars are a good idea due to the many reasons I have come to know through reading the passage provided. There are less distractions while driving these cars. Although they are not full driverless cars, they take over most of the driving. It has been shown that with these driverless cars there are fewer wrecks than with our regular cars we are use to driving everyday.

While driving the driverless cars people still have most of the control. When a dangerous or risky situation is approaching the driver is signaled to take control over the car. So the driver does have control during difficult or risky situations. For example like backing out of a driveway or even into one, complicated traffic situations, and even navigating through road work, or accidents. The car only has control in calm situations that may not cause harderous risks.

Millions upon millions of dallars have went into this project not only to manufacture the cars and to make sure they work , but also to fix situations due to the saftey or anything regarding the car. If something is not up to date, or isn't working corectly the engineers are paid to fix it. This causes the driverless cars to be more efficent and safe. Texting and driving is a huge problem with the society we live in today, but if you put thought into it the car can take over driving while you or whoever reply to that text instead of putting peoples lifes at risk. Also, another example would be if your running late and trying to finish getting ready your car could drive while your finishing up.

After reading this passage and inferring some things I have came to the conclusion that driverless cars are not only more convinent but also safer and cause less polution. Driverless cars have had a signifcate difference in wreck numbers than a regular car. As a bonus they give out less polution while driving. Which not only means they're safer for the enviorment, but also safer for peoples lifes. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
7FF600C1F829,"Hey, so like, I'm gonna write this essay about young teens making career choices early on. I know some people think it's a good idea, but I'm not so sure.

First of all, let's talk about the advantages. If you decide on a career early on, you can start preparing for it right away. Like, you can take classes in high school that will help you get into college for that field, or you can start internships to get some experience. That's pretty cool. Plus, it's good to have a plan, you know? It can help you stay focused and motivated.

But, there are also some disadvantages. One of them is that you might not have a chance to explore other options. Like, what if you're really good at math and science, but you're also interested in art and music? If you decide on a career too early, you might not have time to explore those other interests. And, what if you change your mind? It's hard to switch gears when you've already committed to one thing.

Another thing is that, sometimes, young teens don't have enough life experience to make informed decisions. I mean, I'm only 14, so I don't know everything there is to know about the world. How can I be sure I'm making the right choice? It's like, maybe I should wait until I'm older and have more experiences under my belt before making such a big decision.

And, let's not forget about the pressure. Parents and teachers might put a lot of pressure on you to choose a certain career, and that can be really stressful. Like, I know my mom wants me to be a doctor or a scientist or something, but I'm not sure that's what I want. It's hard to deal with that kind of pressure when you're already trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do with your life.

So, in conclusion, making a career choice early on can have both advantages and disadvantages. It's important to weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision, but it's also okay to take your time and explore other options. Ultimately, it's your life,",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay discussing the advantages and disadvantages of young teenagers making the decision to choose a specific career at an early age.,4
06BFA3A7DF52,"I think the limiting for car usage is not right because if people want to drive they should be able to. Walking, and riding bicycles aren't fun you get tired really easy and have to stop but when you are in a car you don't get tired and you don't have to stop you just keep driving.

Driving a car is easier because when you are late for work or getting somewhere you can get there faster. If you are walking or riding a bike your not going to get there on time a car is faster and quicker to get to places without any trouble. Gas could be high but it is worth it because a lady with three kids could be rushing trying not to be late for work and trying to get her kids ready for school so instead of walking them to school or riding bikes she could just drive them to school and not be late for work. Driving a car is so much easier and quicker.

Traffic with cars is bad but when you need to get places you can drive a car instead of taking the bus that has to stop ten different places. Cars are being banned in Columbia and you can only ride buses or taxis. Taxis can get you where you need to just as fast as your own car can but a bus couldn't because there is always people in front of you that have to get off in different places. They made two seated bikes just for this man and his wife to get around because they didn't want them driving there cars.

Teenagers get there license at a young age now and they start driving. They drive to school and to practices and everywhere else but it could be dangerous because some teenagers just like to goof and round and try to act all bad and then end up hurting them self and somebody else and it would be their fault. Some teens just decide not to get them because it is safe just to ride with their parents instead of them driving and having the chance to get in a wreck and hurt their self and then there car be ruined and won't be able to get a new one. Most teens love to drive because it's fun and they like getting out on there own. Teens like to go out and hang with there friends or go get something to eat. Other people are more worried about there job and social life then trying to get a car so they can drive all the time.

In conclusion, a limiting on car usage should be that they shouldn't have a limiting on car usage because most people are late for stuff when they don't drive there car. Walking and driving a car is way different a car is way faster then walking and trying to get to places on time.

Although some kid just dont like being social or working along side someone they dont know. Most extracurricular involve social skills like, talking to a teammate. helping someone with a project, or just playing a game like football or soccer. Whats to say that someone dont have server anxiety where they cant be around other people.

Sports are extracurricular that u need money to be apart of but what happens when i student dont have the money to join the team. Many other clubs make u pay a fee to join. If you do a project in a club you may need money to bye the supplies for said project. Gasoline also coast's a lot today and u need that to get to the extracurricular. What happens when your parents cant bring u to the meeting or the games that affects the way u partake in the group setting.

Parents are over protective of there kids, some parents wont let there kid join because of there protectiveness. And sports are very dangers if not played properly. there parent also might want them to stay at home so they can do family activities together. and what if i child has a Illness and cant do extracurricular became of there illness or disability.

parents can also be really attached to their kid so much they dont want then to go to school.

I know you are very concerned about the issue of having cell-phones in school but I have an idea that benefits us as students and the staff like you at our middle school.

My idea is to allow cell-phones during lunch periods or any other time of the school day when we aren't in class, but all students must have cell-phones turned off during regular classes. This idea not only helps and benefits us in so many ways but there is also nothing wrong with it!

There are plenty of ways that this benefits us students and i can show you how. If we have our cell-phones for lunch or any other free period we can use them to contact our parents. This way if we need to stay after school one day, or if they need to bring something important into school that we left home... all we have to do is simply call or even text message them it's that easy. We can even use them for emergencies or personal issues. If we are having an emergency and for some reason are not able to use the phones provided at the school, and your rule is to allow no cell-phones inside the school premises... well then we are going to be trapped! If you don't allow cell phones at school and we need to contact someone immediately no one is going to have a phone on them and something seriously bad could happen to someone. Even if you have a personal and private issue and your mother or father have no access of contacting you other than your cell-phone then there is going to be one serious problem.

Don't think i forgot about you and the rest of the staff though because there is also plenty of ways this benefits you and the rest of our school staff. Having our cell-phones turned off during classes makes it so there is no possible way that we can cheat on a test. That way you wouldn't even have to worry about a problem like that. It would definitely be no distraction what so ever to the class because we would understand the serious consequences of having a cell-phone on during a regular class period. This also can help you by having way less kids running in and out of the office trying to use the one phone the school has! If most kids have their own cell-phone then the office phone would rarely ever be busy with kids trying to contact their parents. When we are allowed to have our cell-phones on there is nothing that can go wrong. If we are just in a free period or lunch it's not like we can cheat on anything or use our cell-phones for anything other than what's necessary and i am very sure that students would never take advantage of having that rule.

I really hope that you can take this into thought, it would be such an honor for us students to have you agree to this rule, please and thank you.

All throughout our school we have students who perform community service. Some help tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. Yet, there are some students here who don't perform any community service at all. I personally think that community service is an excellent activity that anyone of any age can get involved in. I believe that you should consider requiring that all students here have to perform community service. Some might argue that community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do, but if everyone would just spend an hour a day or even a week to help out our community by picking up trash, tutoring students, helping the elderly, and helping at local stores think of what we could achieve. Our community would be a much better place to live in. It would be cleaner, safer for everyone of all ages, and happier. It all just starts by you taking community service into your own hands. Think to yourself; what will make a difference in our community and world, a couple of kids or a couple hundred? We need to show our leadership and make a difference in our community. Who knows maybe it will turn into something greater. We all just need to put in an effort and we will start to make a difference in the world, one step at a time. Please take this letter into consideration.

I think students should be required to perform community service. Students who do community service would be helping our community be safe and clean. Being a part of community service will be helping our community be safe by reducing crimes and protecting our neighborhood. There are many ways students can get active about our community. When students help out they are making the community a much more better place to live in.

Students should be involved with community service because it's a good way to get to know our community and a good chance to keep it safe and clean. Keeping our community safe and clean can be much use to our community. Many students can do many things to help keep our community safe and clean. You can do so by recycling, planting trees and flowers, helping out the elders and doing anything else that would make our community much more better. These are some ways students can participate in community service.

Recycling used things can reduce less trash. When you reduce your trash you're helping the environment and it can also reduce global warming. Helping out our community can also mean helping out our environment. You can also replant things that will help our community become more beautiful. These are some ways to shape our community and make it better by doing community service.

Helping out by tutoring elementary students can maybe bring up test scores and help them have a better understanding of what they are learning. Some elementary school students need as much help as they can get. By helping them out you're making sure they'll do better in the future and become successful. Another way to help out in community service is cleaning up litter. Cleaning up litter helps make the community a cleaner place to live in and it'll help make it a more beautiful place.

Some more ways to get involved with community service is to help out in a nursing home. Many elders need help with many every day things that we can do easily. Helping out elders is very generous. Students who get active in community service is very nice because they are just one step away from helping out the world. Everything you do in your community can influence other people to help out in their own community and sooner or later you might influence the world to reshape itself and become a more better place to live.

These are many reasons why I think students should be active in community service. We're not only helping out our own community but helping out the entire world. We can recycle what we use to help fight global warming and we can also plant things to make our world a more beautiful and better place to live. So I think you should make community service a must do for all students.

A74CF2F7BC8E,"Over the Summer, students tend to disregard and ignore all things academic. This causes students to forget vital information. This can result in a challenge for students when they return to school after break, because they are expected to remember and build off of previously learned information. In an effort to lessen the amount of information lost, Summer projects are put in place and assigned. The teachers in the school should be in control of creating these projects, and assigning them to students. Teachers have a better understanding of what information is most important to retain, as well as what will be expected of students during the following school year.

When a student forgets information over break, a teacher must spend valuable class time reteaching information students should already know. This makes it difficult for teachers to move on to new information, when students need to back-track to information from the previous year. Then teachers are faced with losing time to focus on new information, causing students to feel overwhelmed when needing to make up for lost time curriculum. Summer projects eliminate this problem, because students will not need a refresher course when they return to school. Having Summer assignments keeps information from fading.

In a students perspective, these projects may not seem ideal, and students may feel as though their break is being compromised by still having work to complete over a break. However what the students don't realize, is that continuing to grow their memory of a subject over the Summer can be greatly beneficial. Teachers should create these projects based on what is believed to be most useful, so students can continue to learn and practice certain information that needs to be retained. Some students may protest these assignments, however keeping information over break is vital. Even though teachers know what was important and what will soon be expected; students know their own individual struggles and where they need to strengthen themselves. However if it were up to students to decide what was assigned and completed, not much would be done. This is because students would rather relax and forget information rather than have to do work over their Summer break. This is a main reason it should be up to teachers what information, and how much, is assigned.

Although students know where they individually struggle, teachers know what information will be incorporated into the expectations of students for the next year. These projects should include information from the previous year, but also provide insight into what students will be learning when they return from break. Students can also brush up on their own problem areas to strengthen themselves, while focusing on what teachers have assigned them.

To conclude this argument, students forgetting information over Summer break is not unheard of. It is extremely common but it is a problem students and teachers everywhere face. Teachers making Summer projects helps eliminate some of the information that fades from students, but also keeps their memory fresh to be able to continue to apply the information. Studying and doing schoolwork over the Summer may seem bothersome and laborious to students, but the results will help students secure information, influencing their academic success positively. Teachers should have the ability to assign Summer projects, but should also consult with students on what they believe would be beneficial to include, involving what the majority of the students need extra help understanding. Summer assignments prevent the hassle of reteaching information, giving students more time to learn and understand new information after their break, in the new school year.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

8BD74B7B3DE2,"The opportunity to attain a new style of education such as online schooling should be taken because, If students dont live near any schools that can provide a good education they can do online classes for a better school, If a student is sick they dont have to miss any class work and have their grade effected, And if a student has to leave their town they would be able to keep up with their work.

Some students who live near lower quality school wont get a very good education, But if they had online classes they would have an opportunity to learn at a higher level. Generic_Name lives in a low income area of where he lives and his education is not going the best but with online schooling he could receive education from elsewhere. There are millions of students just like Generic_Name that just want a better education, and with online school this is possible. This isnt just low income areas many schools in higher income areas give poor educations too. Generic_Name lives in north Dakota and there are NO schools in his area but with online classes he could attend online school in a different state. Rather than living near a low quality school Generic_Name dose not live near any schools at all. With online schooling Generic_Name could get the education he needs to be a success in the modern world. In conclusion online schooling give learning opportunities to those who would not normally receive them.

Students all over the united states and the world get sick everyday, But with online classes obstacles such as these would not be as detrimental. In October Generic_Name missed two weeks of school because he had the flu and couldnt leave his bed but if he would have had online classes he could just have done them from home and not have had his grades impacted so severely. Like many others Generic_Name had become sick and had to miss school and many assignments if he would have been able to do his classes online There would have been little to no impact. If more schools would pick up online schooling there would not be incidents like this anymore. Generic_Name recently got back from a trip to France with his family and unfortunately was infected with COVID-19 ( Coronavirus) and now he will have to miss an extended period of school and be quarantined meaning he cant receive an education, But if he could do his work online he would be able to continue to receive an education while quarantined. This being a much more serious scenario of missing school that as of right now schools should start to take into consideration, none the less having online school would solve one of the problems this child is facing. Both of these students could have their grades remain intact if there was online schooling. In conclusion there would be no more need for sick days if when a student is sick they can just work from home.

If a student has to leave town for one reason or another they would still receive an education along as they had access to a computer. Generic_Name went on vacation to Generic_City with her family four days before spring break started so she missed a little bit of school, But if she brought a computer she would not have to fall behind. Generic_Name had to miss school but she had a computer with her so there would be no problem if she could do her work online. This might seem silly to some schools but it would be very helpful to students. Generic_Name had to leave Virginia because her grandmother was diagnosed with cancer and her family wanted to spend time with her in her final months if there was a computer there Generic_Name wouldnt have to miss any class work. Some scenarios of students not being in school are much more serious and the make-up work could be solved while they're away. If there was online school Generic_Name would have one less thing to worry about when she returned. In conclusion online school could help students with catching up on missed class for any reason.

In conclusion if students could attend school online it would solve problems such as, Not living near any schools or any decent schools, students falling ill and being un-able to attend school regularly, And finally If students needed to miss school for family matters. Some might say that having students learn online would encourage them to procrastinate or just skip but not all students are going to just skip school and procrastinate this would actually solve a big problem for many students.

916811E780BD," It is widely believed that younger and older students can benefit from each other's assistance. While older students can provide guidance and support to younger students, younger students can also teach older students valuable skills and perspectives.

One way that older students can help younger students is by showing them that it is okay to ask for help. For example, when I was in seventh grade, I was in dance club and there were 8th graders in the class. They would often help us with the moves if we needed assistance, and if they were doing something wrong, the older kid would help them. This helped me to understand that it is okay to ask for help, and that I could also help others in the same way.

On the other hand, younger students can teach older students how to help others. When I was getting help with a problem, the younger students in the class were also learning how to help others. They taught me that it is okay to not know something and that it is important to ask for help when needed. This helped me to become a more helpful person, and to better understand the needs of others.

In German suburb driving has been forbidden as well as street parking, driveways and home garages. People have been selling their cars just to move to Vauban, Germany. The limiting of car usage has been a great factor to help the enviroment, and to excersize.

The end of car culture is coming to an end because many people have been leaving their cars at home and taking the bus or walkin to work. People are driving less, and the youth have are not excited to be driving. Sociologists believe the decrease amount of driving is due to the fact that we are able to connect with our friends over the internet and no longer need to see each other in person. In many cities around the world are banning driving because of enviromental purposes. In Colombia, there is a car-free day where cars are being banned with only taxis and busses permited. The goal is to promote altenative transportation and reduce smog. In Paris driving was banned due to the amount of smog. They blamed the smog on diesel because 67 percent of the cars use diesel. Although cars were banned in Paris, congestion decreased about 60 percent in the capital of France, after the five-days of smog.

The limiting of car usage can benefit everyone. This is because around the world everyone drives, nobody thinks twice about it. Driving has been a huge part of the America can life, but it seems it is coming to an end people are relying more on walking and riding a bicycle or taking the bus. Car limiting benefits everyone because it will help people stay healthy and hike or bike to point A to point B. People are becoming more enthusiastic about not driving. Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout cities; uneven sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rudh-hour restrictions have cut traffic dramatically; and restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

Dear Principal,

I have heard that there is a new rule being put into place making it so that everyone is required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, clubs or sports or a musical instrument, etc, but what happens if students cannot make it to the activity? What will happen when there are things or important issues that come up causing them to miss the extracurricular? I disagree with putting this rule into action because there are many reasons it isn't helping all students and here are some of my thoughts on why I think it shouldn't be a rule.

Some of the students families in school might be struggling with financial issues or aren't as financially inclined at the time being and might have a hard time keeping up. Making parents spend the money to pay for the extracurricular activity rather than paying for more important stuff isn't something we should be promoting or making a requirement.

Parents work. You work. Teachers work. Most adults work. With that being said, some parents can't take off work to take their children to the sport or club that they participate in because they don't have time and their work is important to help support the family. Along with parents not having time, students and kids can struggle with time and not being able to make it to the extracurricular. Homework and schoolwork can be a big deal to us. It affects the grade point average and then colleges and then your career as an adult. Although, that might seem far fetched but that's how others think and that's how some plan. Students might need tutoring and help and having to participate in an activity can take away that time.

I do sports and play instruments. I always have, but it's been a choice for me to participate in each of them. I once did four, but that was too much for me so I stopped one. Having the option to stop or not do an activity is something every one of us needs. People like doing new things and trying them out but to others it frightens them. Thats how it is with requiring the participation in an extracurricular activity. Some like doing things and getting out and trying different things but others find it a struggle and unnecessary to do. While I see that you are trying to help and think that this is the right option and should be something necessary I think that other families can find it is a hassle and that making kids participate in extracurricular shouldn't be required but more encouraged as a choice that is fun and new. I hope you take this into consideration.

E8DAB90C65F7,"Working alone versus working with a group: which one is better? This is a question that has been debated for years, with each side presenting its own set of arguments. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the benefits of working alone versus working with a group, and argue that working with a group is ultimately more beneficial.

Working alone has its advantages. For one, it allows for a great deal of focus and concentration. When working alone, there are no distractions or interruptions from other group members. This can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Additionally, working alone allows for a great deal of autonomy and control over one's work. This can be particularly beneficial for those who prefer to work at their own pace and in their own way.

However, working alone also has its disadvantages. For one, it can be isolating and lonely. Without the support and collaboration of a group, it can be difficult to stay motivated and engaged. Additionally, working alone can limit the amount of knowledge and expertise that can be gained. Without the perspectives and ideas of others, it can be difficult to come up with creative solutions to problems.

Working with a group, on the other hand, has its own set of benefits. For one, it allows for collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and expertise. When working with a group, each member brings their own unique skills and perspectives to the table. This can lead to a more well-rounded and comprehensive solution to a problem. Additionally, working with a group can provide a sense of community and support. This can be particularly beneficial for those who may be new to a particular field or topic.

However, working with a group also has its disadvantages. For one, it can be difficult to manage and coordinate the efforts of a group. This can lead to conflicts and delays in completing tasks. Additionally, working with a group can be distracting and overwhelming, with multiple people vying for attention and input.

In conclusion, working alone and working with a group each have their own set of benefits and disadvantages. While working alone can provide a great deal of focus and autonomy, it can also be isolating and limit the amount of knowledge and expertise that can be gained. Working with a group, on the other hand, allows for collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and expertise, but can also be difficult to manage and distract",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,7

9C9C4EECA979," Working in a group can be more beneficial than working alone. There are several reasons why this is the case. Firstly, when you work in a group, you have access to a wider range of ideas, writing, examples, and information. This is because you can share your thoughts and ideas with your group members, who can then provide feedback and suggestions.

One of the main benefits of working in a group is the ability to collaborate and work together on tasks. This can be particularly useful when it comes to brainstorming and problem-solving. When you work with others, you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with new solutions to problems. This can be especially helpful when working on complex projects that require a lot of creativity and innovation.

Another benefit of working in a group is the ability to learn from each other. When you work with others, you can learn new skills and perspectives that you may not have considered before. This can be particularly helpful when you are working on a project that requires a diverse range of skills and knowledge.

Working alone can be limiting in many ways. For example, you may not have access to the same level of support and guidance that you would receive when working in a group. Additionally, you may not have the same level of motivation and accountability when working alone. This can make it more difficult to stay on track and complete tasks to the best of your ability.

In conclusion, working in a group can be more beneficial than working alone. This is because you have access to a wider range of ideas, writing, examples, and information, as well as the ability to collaborate and learn from each other.

C9EB6EB6551D,"Online classes are a great idea. The benefits of online classes are the student won't have any distraction around him. Online classes are small and everyone gets there own teachers. The disadvantage is not completing the course. These are the reason why I think online classes are much beneficial then regular class.

The student will be more focused on their school work. As there is no distraction around him. For example, a smart student sometimes isn't able to finish his work because they would be talking to other students during class. There is no other student just you and the teachers so you won't have any distraction. There is no distraction in their room if their alone.

Online classes are known to be small. There for its good as the student would have a one on one conversation with the teacher. If the student does't understand something, and needs help the teacher being able to give more time and attention to the student. When you finish with the class your done you won't have to wait for anybody else. Basally online classes are school but independent just you and the teacher.

The disadvantage are not completing the course ,because most students get distraction watching or reading other things online not related to school. Also not completing assignment or the course thinking its not school because your not going to school. You also won't be able to interact with other student. Also you can't participate in clubs or sports team after school because your talking classes online. You can pay at a private school or a team to do a after school activity.

I personal agree that online classes are more beneficial to the student. The student would focused on the school work because there is no distractions around them. The teachers would give them more time and attention to the student because it's one teacher per student. If you want to do a after school activity you can pay and play a sport for the team pay a private school to do a club. These advantages to do Online classes.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

When our great leaders died they're visions didn't die. They wanted the people to be in charge of who runs there country and what happens in them. Why is this not happening the way our founders wanted it. Having the Electoral College is not a bad idea but, its not a great one. Demolishing the Electoral College is the only fair way.

In the article "" In Defense of the Electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Although it mention how good the Electoral College is it also mentions how ""the Electoral College method of selectin the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carry their state....Knowing their vote will have no effect"". Popular vote don't seem to matter, The Peoples vote don't seem to matter.

Others may argue that the Electoral college helps break a tie but, that only happened one time. If we ever had a issue like that again we could just enforce the Electoral College but, the people the say of who leads us after all we are one nation under god. In the article"" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford plumer states"" Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Furthermore he goes on to say ""  state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Can't we just enforce the Electoral College when we need a tie breaker. The Electoral College consist of five-hundred thirty-eight electors which happens to be an even number. Even if its a slight chance couldn't an Electoral College voting happen to be a tie. The population doesn't have even or odds in this case because every year new people are getting to the age that  they can vote.

In the article ""what is the Electoral college?"" The Office of the Federal Register states that"" the founding fathers establish it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the presidentby a vote in congress and the election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" As you see it says a comprimise not total dictatorship. Everybody has rights voters rights are being tampered with. freedom to vote doesn't seem neccessary because we may have freedom to vote but our votes isn't making a difference. As Plumer said if there is a chance of a tie "" the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president....Because each state cast only one vote ,the single reprsentative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representative from California, who represent 35 million voters.""

92E1CFD27E95,"Is it a good idea to force students to participate in extracurricular activities? Extracurricular are set in place to allow students to expand on what they want for their future which should be optional. Being forced to do these could discourage students from what they want to be by having it forced upon them. Clubs and participating in yearbooks could help students make friends and build social skills. In my opinion extracurricular activities should be optional, expand more on student ideas and grades while also helping build social skills.

Extracurricular activities should not be mandatory by any means because they are made to be optional. If any student was forced to do any extracurricular activity it could make that topic boring for them. Having mandatory sports for example could make that teams hype lower. Having students that do not want to be on yearbook on yearbook might make it turn not as expected. Extracurricular activities can help build a students understanding of a topic that they are interested in.

These activities could count toward extra credit if needed for lower grades and help them improve. This could help them for later in life with college. Extra activities could make the student want to help other students in what they want to do. Activities like sports could help students make money in the future if they are good at them. Extracurricular activities could help students make friends if they choose to help other students.

Helping other students would be good at building teamwork for things like sports. Helping other students could make students better tutors. When students are better tutors they could possibly teach a younger generation as well. Social skills could help students apply for jobs and make themselves look better for better opportunities. Working with other people could help the student have a better understanding of what other people may be struggling with in a topic.

As explained extracurricular activities are nice thing to have for these reasons and my opinion is that they should be kept but not forced to be done. Activities are meant to be enjoyed not exploited by the higher staff of the school. Pushing students to do something could possibly be bad for their state of mind and personality. In the end do not make them do it but leave them as an option.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
B2919590BDB0,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that agreeing with Prime Minister Winston Churchill that failure is a stepping stone for success is important. Churchill's statement highlights the importance of learning from our mistakes and using them to improve ourselves.

One of the reasons why Churchill's statement is important is that it encourages us to take risks. In order to achieve success, we often need to take risks and step outside of our comfort zones. However, taking risks can also lead to failure. By viewing failure as a stepping stone, we can learn from our mistakes and use them to improve our future actions.

Another reason why Churchill's statement is important is that it helps us to develop resilience. Failure is a natural part of life, and it's important to be able to bounce back from it. By viewing failure as a stepping stone, we can develop the resilience needed to overcome challenges and achieve success.

Furthermore, Churchill's statement highlights the importance of perseverance. Success rarely comes overnight, and it often takes hard work and perseverance to achieve it. By viewing failure as a stepping stone, we can learn to persevere through difficult times and continue to work towards our goals.

In conclusion, I believe that agreeing with Prime Minister Winston Churchill that failure is a stepping stone for success is important. Churchill's statement encourages us to take risks, develop resilience, and persevere through difficult times.

FAE3AC62234D,"Summer break is a long three months away from school for students to relax, learn new skills and enjoy themselves. Most students tend to forget everything they are taught throughout the school year over this break. Summer break to majority of students is time for having the best time of their lives doing all the things they love which hardly ever includes academic work. Teacher-designed summer projects would be a very effective way to ensure students keep receiving knowledge throughout their summer break because education is a continuous process. Teachers would be the best choice to design these summer projects because they thoroughly know the syllabus of the course they teach, they would give realistic projects students can complete on time and teachers would be fair in selecting the type and criteria of the project.

Teachers have all the information about the courses they teach and what their students need to know each year. Teacher-designed projects would entail the necessary topics and lessons for students to work on during their summer break. Other people might argue that the students are also well informed about what they are being taught so should create their own summer projects but most students might just have an idea about what they need to know but might not know about the course in detail as much as the teacher does with all their years of experience and trying new approaches to figure out what works best for their students. Students might also just want to create projects that would be very easy to complete just so they can get it over with. At the end of the day if students are allowed to create their own projects they end up learning nothing new because it was based on stuff they already knew. For example a Geometry teacher teaching tenth graders would not create a math project for tenth grade students based on sixth grade math because that is way below them.

With teacher designed-projects they are more likely to have realistic amount of work and would be possible for students to complete and meet the goal at the end of the break, teachers would most definitely not give too much work to overburden students since they also need some rest or too little work to students but give them just enough work for the break. But if student-designed projects are used students are more likely to create very short and straight to the point projects because most students are lazy and just do not want to be bothered with any work so would not want to challenge themselves to research and do more but would want very few questions that would not need any serious thinking and application of knowledge. A teacher who teaches a 12th grade English class could give a summer project for students to read and summarize a book of their choice and find out the meanings of 20 new words in the book but students would have probably wanted a project where they just write out ten new words from the book they read.

Every student always wants the easy way out of everything so if allowed to create a summer project would just create a project based on what they are very good at for example; a project with artwork, a crossword puzzle or a project about their own sentences and this would lead to a disagreement among the students to pick the best project which would be good for everyone. However, a teacher would not be biased in choosing a summer project for their students, they would assign a project based on skills all their students are expected to know or already have without picking out what some particular people would want in that class.

Ultimately, teachers know the best approaches and methods when it comes to projects for their students because they have worked with many different students over the years and came up with very effective teacher-designed summer projects to help their students keep learning over the break without stressing them.                                           ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
llama_70b_v1707,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" thinks that studying Venus is a good idea, even though it's dangerous. I agree with the author and here's why.

First, the author tells us about the thick atmosphere and extreme temperatures on Venus. This makes it hard to send probes there and get good data. But, the author says that studying Venus will help us learn about the Earth's atmosphere and how to stop pollution. This is important because we want to keep the Earth healthy.

Second, the author talks about how studying Venus can help us learn about other planets too. Venus is like a ""window"" into the universe, and by studying it, we can learn about other planets that are similar. This will help us understand the universe better and maybe even find other planets that can support life.

Third, the author says that the challenges of studying Venus are worth it because of the big rewards. For example, Venus has a lot of sulfur, which could be used as a resource. Also, studying Venus will help us learn more about volcanoes and how they work. This will help us predict when volcanoes will erupt and how to prepare for them.

In conclusion, the author does a great job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

B617FC07CCB6,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Sports are very important to many of our students but academics is far more important than any sport. Students need to learn to push themselves harder if they want the privilege of playing sports. Students should not be allowed to accept the minimum. The students are our next generation they need to learn how to be pushed. i am all for your change from a ""c"" average to a ""b"" average.

The athletes at our school are very talented athletically and academically but when it comes to academics they tend to slack. Athletes feel as though because they are captain of their basketball team or made the varsity football team they are on top so they don't need to try when it comes to academics...well they thought wrong. The academic average of a ""c"" for an athlete is way too low. Just how athletes are pushed when it comes the their sports, they should be pushed in academics as well. Letting athletes have a ""c"" average is saying you don't have to try because you'll make it anyways. When in fact that is not true. Athletes need to learn that if you push yourself in school you can make it just about anywhere.

Athletes aren't allowed just to do the minimum on the field or on the court so why should they be allowed to do the minimum in classrooms. Coaches tell their players to always give one-hundred and ten percent every time they go to play a game. If they do that there then why not in the classrooms?

Now one might say that not all athletes just sit back. Well I understand that. I do know that there are a handful of athletes who actually try their hardest to do well, so they might think that this isn't fair when in fact it is only helping them to do better and keep trying. You are not going to be the star of every game that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play right? Same way in the class, you are not always going to be the star student but you keep on trying until you are. Same as you do when you go to practice.

Now stop Worrying about what the slackers say because you are only helping them.

That is how most students find something that they really like to do. Extracurricular activities are a way for students to explore there talents and find what they are good at and what they can improve. I believe all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they have something to look forward to, get to make new friends, and get to try something new.

One reason reason students should do an after school activity is because it gives them something to look forward to. Most students agree that school is boring because they learn about stuff that they don't find useful. some students even drop out of school because of those reasons. However, with extracurricular activities you get to do what you want to do after the school day. Instead of people dropping out of school so they can start a music career, they can join a music club after school. Then they can work on both their academic work and perfecting their music talent without dropping out

Another reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they can make friends. Most friends people make at school are through extracurricular activities because everyone there has similar interests. At the beginning of my first year of middle school I auditioned for the middle school musical

Rock of Ages . I didn't have many friends at the beginning of the year, but I made a lot of friends through the musical who I am still friends with now.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they get to try something new. School should be about learning what this is you can do well naturally and what you might need improvement on, and this is exactly what extracurricular activities do. There are different types of activities for different types of students. You cans sign up for the school play, a sport that you like, a club that helps the environment, and countless others. If students didn't sign for an extracurricular activities they wouldn't be able to experience everything that their class mates did and they might regret their decision later.

Extracurricular activities are something every student should do because it lets them try something new, helps them make friends, and it gives them something to look forward to. Some people don't think every student should be forced to do extracurricular activities because it takes time away from students being able to spend time with family or do homework, and they are right. However, even though they will have less time to spend with their family and on homework the students will still be happy because they got to do an extracurricular activity. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

I agree that all students should be required to perform community service because it will help the students to be more active, it will guide us in the right direction, it will help keep our communities clean, and kids will be able to know how to perform a project worth doing.

I think that you should require all students to perform community service because kids our age start getting lazy and are not willing to get up and work with nothing in return. Kids these days only work for money and would never pick up a piece of paper of the ground because they have more ""important"" things to do. When my dad was a kid, he loved to do work for other people like he does now and he has impressed many people, some of these people was his boss, his teachers and principles, his parents, neighbors, friends, they all loved him so other kids started working too. Soon enough the whole community was clean but they kept on working to make it even better. Community service is very important especially for the youth of today.

When the middle school kids grow up, they will be led in the direction of helping others and when you help others you have no choice but to be nice to them too. My dad always takes us out to help the elderly who are to old to work. At first I looked at them and was disgusted. I wanted to be mean but since I was helping them it was impossible to be mean so I learned to be kind and gentlnow I love talking to the elderly about stories that might not even be true.

Parks are being trashed, teenagers are vandalizing buildings and equipment, many people let it go and blame them for making the communities trashed when rally it's our fault. If kids do community service, not only will it lower the vandalism it will also help clean up what's already there. In Boy scouts we are required to lead and perform one big project to help the community for the ranks of Star, Life, and Eagle. These service projects help the kids how to lead and perform a community service project. If the school requires this then we will have more and more kids learning how to create and follow through with a project. I hope the middle school kids will be able to help our community.

71F27422C5FC,"Dear Members of the Local Government,

I am writing to express my concern regarding the proposed change of the school week from five to four days. While I understand the potential benefits of a four-day work week, I strongly believe that this change would have negative consequences for students.

Firstly, a four-day work week would mean that students would have less time to complete their work and assignments. With only three days to finish everything, students would be under immense pressure to complete their work, which could lead to a rise in stress levels and a decline in academic performance. For example, during the three-day weekend, students may feel overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to complete and may struggle to maintain focus.

Secondly, a four-day work week would mean that students would have less time to engage in extracurricular activities, such as sports or clubs. These activities provide students with opportunities to develop new skills, socialize with their peers, and build their resumes. By reducing the number of days in the week, students would have less time to participate in these activities, which could lead to a decline in their overall well-being.

Lastly, a four-day work week would mean that students would have more time to relax and unwind. While this may seem like a positive thing, it could actually have a negative impact on students' academic performance. When students have too much time off, they may become unfocused and disengaged from their studies. For example, during the three-day weekend, students may spend their time watching TV or playing video games instead of studying or working on their assignments.

In conclusion, while the idea of a four-day work week may seem appealing, I strongly believe that this change would have negative consequences for students. By reducing the number of days in the week, students would have less time to complete their work, engage in extracurricular activities, and focus on their studies. I urge you to consider the potential drawbacks of this proposal and to carefully consider the impact it would have on our students.

What are ways that can help create a stronger and better student? The principal of Generic_School, Generic_Name, had an idea that will only help benefit and strengthen the students which is by assigning every student in the school with the responsibility of having to preform and maintain an extracurricular activity.

Allowing and giving the students a place where they can spark new interests and express themselves can have a tremendous boost to their mental health along with their self-esteem because of the environment they placed themselves in, and the fact that they can express themselves. A recent study done in Harvard, said, ""93% of students that participate in extracurricular activities are 86% happier with themselves and others because the students are given a chance to express themselves, and feel safe from expressing themselves"". A reason that proves why its better for students to have a strong and penetrable mindset is that students with stronger mindsets tend to do better in school. According to a professor from Yale, ""Students with a good mental health do better in school because the students worry less and have a more positive mindset"". Both of these studies prove how beneficial it can be to assign the responsibility to every student of having to maintain an extracurricular activity because in the long run the students will be happier both with themselves and others, and have a better education, along with a stronger mindset.

Students having to preform extracurricular activities can create new friendships, and bonds with people. An example of this would be if a student named Generic_Name was really into football and equally talented to the amount of love he has for the sport. Generic_Name tried out for the football team and he made the team and now played first string wide receiver. Throughout Generic_Name's football season he created a lot of close friendships with his teammates because of their strong roots of interest when relating to football. Another reason that supports the thesis of extracurricular activities creating friendships is from a study recently done in Northern Virginia, from the University of Marymount. According to a professor named Albert Finkilstein, ""more then two thirds of people with similar interests become friends because of the mutual interests both parties share"". Albert Finkilsteins research proves that the extracurricular activities can sprout new friendships among the student population of Generic_School. However, a very important effect that pieces together why is is so important for friendships to be made is that students with more friends have a stronger education. According to a study done in Callasbases Florida, ""nearly 80% of students that have friends and are able to ask questions, share emotions with, and lastly feel comfortable with have a stronger education because students can rely on their friends for help with homework because students feel more comfortable asking questions to friends when compared to teachers"". Another positive affect of creating friendships is that there will be a better High School experience for the student because of the friendships made and the trust that was formed. Overall, with creating friendships from the extracurricular activities comes a stronger education, more people to rely on, and overall a better high school experience because of the friendships made and the comfortability made from creating those friendships.

Forcing students to have to be able to balance school work along with an extracurricular activity can be very helpful in the idea of making students have to learn how to maintain efficient time management skills along with being more productive. One reason as to why extracurricular activities can be beneficial and help teach how to be productive of time to students would be that the students can't risk to have bad grades because the school of Generic_School is a prestigious private school meaning that the school only accepts the students with the best grades and the students that are willing to work the hardest. According to Generic_School, ""90 % of all students in the school have straight A's"", and, "" Any student that doesn't have all straight A's than can only have at the most three B+ and then the rest straight A's"". From how strict the school is with their grades it seems that they are very productive and efficient since they only expect 110% all the time. However, it is easy to slip up or possibly fall behind and the best way to keep the productiveness flowing and for the students to do their homework every night is to never stop being productive which is why having an extracurricular activity is very beneficial because it helps teach all of the students how to maintain productiveness and how to have good time management skills. An example of a student being productive with their time would be to go home and do their homework, and to then think ahead and piece the amount of projects that could be coming up and when to do them and then align the upcoming work with days that they are free to do the work so that the students don't overwork themselves and instead get their homework done when it needs to be done and then spacing out the upcoming projects on days that they are free. Overall, having extracurricular activities can help students expand on being more productive, being able to have good time management skills, and space things along with being able to maintain such things.

The strengths and effects that can be created with the idea of students having to maintain and participate in extracurricular activities are improving students mental health, students creating friendships with one-another, and lastly, the idea of students having to learn to balance extracurricular school activities with school work along with learning how to create more efficient time management skills and being more productive. ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
B83DD09D3129,"Thomas Jefferson was a prominent figure in American history who believed in the importance of hard work and never giving up. While Jefferson's idea has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks.

On the one hand, following Jefferson's idea of hard work and never giving up can lead to great success. By working tirelessly towards one's goals, individuals can achieve their desired outcomes and make a significant impact on the world. This mindset can also lead to personal growth and development, as individuals learn to persevere through challenges and overcome obstacles.

However, there are also drawbacks to following Jefferson's idea. For example, it can lead to burnout and exhaustion if individuals do not take care of themselves and prioritize self-care. Additionally, it can create unrealistic expectations and lead to feelings of inadequacy if individuals do not achieve their goals or experience setbacks.

Furthermore, the idea of never giving up can also lead to a lack of flexibility and an inability to adapt to changing circumstances. In some cases, it may be necessary to reassess one's goals and adjust course to achieve success.

In conclusion, while Thomas Jefferson's idea of hard work and never giving up has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks.

Would you please consider to let students play sports unless they are failing two classes? many of my fellow class mates will feel very strongly against your decision if you do not at least consider what I am about to say.

First, most of the students at this school have a C average. Next, if only students with a B average can participate in sports, many students with a C- average would feel discouraged and give up before even trying. Some people in Algebra 1 have a c+ average because the work is substantially harder than Algebra A. Also since most of the students in the school have C averages than there wouldn't be that many people to try out for sports teams. Most of the students who have an A-B average are not very good at sports and therefore they don't even try out for sports teams. If they did try out than your team will mostly consist of scrubs. If there are only scrubs on your team than schools like SCHOOL_NAME and SCHOOL_NAME would murder them, and you wouldn't get any more trophies for the rest of the year.

Since most of the students have C averages, they wouldn't get put on the team, and thus they probably wouldn't make their high school team because over the Summer they would have had to start all over in their training because their muscles have forgotten how to play the sport like: swimming, basketball, baseball, and etc you have to continually practice in order to get better at it and in some states you can't practice them all year round so the only time they get to play them is for their school teams.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Other cars, such as the Google car have made it so that the car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other car manufacturers have considered putting flashing lights on the windshield and having other heads-up displays.

I think students shouldn't have to perform community service because students sometimes have issues at home were they cant stay after school for activities. One reason they might not be able to do community service is because they might have a love one that is sick at home and they have to be there for there aid. Second reason is because a student might have financial problems at home were they may have to take on a part time job after school to help around the household with payments. The final reason is that student there self may have health issues forbidding them from doing any community service. Those are the reasons why a student may not be able to do community work after school because of personal issues.

Also students shouldn't have to perform community service because they might have other activities, clubs, groups or sport related things happening after school. One reason is they might be too busy after school everyday to do anything else on the side such as being on a sports team for the town or at school. Second reason is because they might be in a church group that meets everyday to sing or study. The final reason is because a student may just be busy doing regular things like watching a relative after school while their parent or guardian is at work. Now even though my opinion is no doesn't mean community service shouldn't be done it just shouldn't be forced on students to do.

690D4166C20C,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand that you wish to change our school policy regarding requirements for sports. Now I know that we have many wonderful students who are tremendous at their sport and they made a commitment to have a C average or above. Raising the requirements to a B average would make them try harder, but some would give up because they think its too hard. Having smart students who participate in sports would be quite interesting but what about our star Football players, Basketball players, or Cheerleaders who have a C average and have to give up something they love. Now I know I wouldn't want to give up my sport because of my grades, and i know you love watching our teams win. And if every athlete who have a C average quit their sport then we would have very few athletes in our school and a less likely chance of winning our games and that wouldn't be first-rate now would it? Our students have fair grades but I do admit they could be better, I believe we should recommend B averages instead of enforcing a ""law"" about them. Other than sports there are the OTHER_NAME, Beta Club, and Art Club. If we raised the requirements for the grade average then some students wouldn't be able to participate in these clubs, and it would be a pity if we had to lose very important members of our clubs. Why raise the Grade average when it is fine the way it is? I think that we should leave it the way it is now and keep our sports teams, academic teams, and school clubs the way they're supposed to be with every member remaining on that specific group, club, team, or whatever you wish to call it.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
EC1D25B7A42E,"Students will benefit from having the option to attend classes from home. There are several schools that offer the choice to learn from home and students have been able to benefit from it. Allowing students to have a choice in their education offers relief from forcing them to learn a certain way that brings them discomfort. Some may believe that offering distance learning is an awful idea because it keeps students from society, and while that may be true the option offers a unique way of learning. Students should be able to attend classes from home because it offers a comfortable environment for them to learn in, it gives them another way to learn, and it prepares them for a possible future.

While learning students should feel comfortable in the environment they are in and doing it from home allows them freedom from other outside pressures. Allowing students to attend classes from home removes stress from having to do assignments in a rush; however, there are certain programs that do have time limits for assignments, some give students a leeway to do them. For example, my cousin felt stress and discomfort at his school with the way he was learning, so my family moved him to online learning at home, and now he is in a better environment to succeed in his education. Some may believe that the way someone learns has nothing to do with their environment, and while it might be true, we can see how students can be affected by observing them. Furthermore, certain environments give prime examples of how comfort affects the way students receive knowledge.

In the world some people are not provided with many choices in how they want their life to be, so offering the option to students is a pleasant idea. Some children in other parts of the world do not get to have a choice in how they receive an education, so giving the option does matter. Each student perceives knowledge in a different way and because the world is changing with technology and the internet, attending classes at home by the way of online or video conferencing does not sound like such a horrific idea. There are people who do not like the idea of changing the way students learn because they are terrified of change, so offering the choice is a problem to many. Others have the belief that giving the choice to students on how they want to learn is an amazing idea because it allows them to have a say in how they want to go about their education.

One last benefit of allowing students to learn from home is that they will be prepared for the future if they decide to pursue a job or career that makes you work from home. While students are learning at home, they are also getting the experience of working at home and developing skills for the future. Although there are people who have the belief that working from home isn't actually a job because you aren't considered to be working; there are plenty of examples of people who work at home and have made successful careers from being at home. Plenty of people have made incredible careers from the experience of learning at home, so it is a possibility for those students who get the chance to learn at home. Students will have a chance to be prepared for a possible future if they so desire while getting a different learning experience from it all.

In conclusion, students will benefit in different ways from being offered the option to attend classes at home. Schools are allowing students to have a say in their education which is what matters because choices are considered to be something important. Attending classes at home allows students to have an option in the way they receive knowledge because it could be a fun, unique, and new way of learning for them. While students will be in a pleasant environment, will be given a choice, and will be prepared for something in a near future. Furthermore, changing the way students learn will be a key part in the future when everything changes with time.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
945CCBB52DED,"The Electorial College is something in the United States that needs to be replaced. It is an irrational system that takes the people's power to vote away from them. The system has flaws that leave the possibility of disaster open to happen. It takes the power to choose the goverment officials from the people, and gives it to a group of people who can vote either way. Why would we keep this?

The Electorial College is a way to choose the Presidential canidate who wins the election. It involves a slate of electors (according to Source 2) who cast their votes in. The people in each state vote for the winning electors of that state. The electors pledge to a canidate and thats what people vote for. Once the people choose a winning elector group they go to Congress and cast their votes in for who they want, and that person then gets so many votes. The problem is that the electors aren't required to vote for who they said they would, so if the elector suddenly decided to change his mind after he or she won, the people's votes are basically invalidated and a different elector gets the votes. This effectively removes the people from the equation in who gets elected. All an elector would have to do is win over the people, then he or she could just change their minds and cast a different vote than what they said they were going to do. The people who vote don't even vote for the Presidential canidate in this system, they vote for a bunch of electors that they hope will vote for what they said.

This is not an irrational, unrealized fear. It has actually happened before. According to Source 3, in the 2000 election, Al Gore had a majority of popular votes, but less electorial votes, so he lost to Bush. This isn't even the first time it has happened, it has happened previous times throughout U.S. history. This is a clear example of how flawwed the Electorial College system. Between the possibility of the people's votes not counting for anything, and that they don't even actually vote for their preffered canidate, this system needs to be replaced.

Some may argue that the chance of an elector not casting his or her vote that he pledged to is very slim. Why would you even be ok with taking such a chance? It's better to be one-hundred percent sure of what will happen instead of ninety-five percent. Also, since most states in the U.S. award electorial votes by a winner-takes-all basis (according to Source 3), if one side of the votes wins, even by a slim margin, they get all the votes. This seems unfair, since if they won by a slim margin at least some of the state thinks it should be a different vote. It would make more sense if the states awarded both sides of the vote if it was a close win for one side or the other, but they would award the true winner with more votes than the narrow loser.

Another problem with the E.C. system is that states that are largely of one belief ( Republican or Democrat ect. ) have no real reason to pay attention to the opposite side of the canidacy. Since the state would be largely one thing or the other, it is irrelivant if thirty percent of the state votes one way if seventy percent of the state votes the other, since the landslide victory style of electorial vote giving is present in most states. This also means that states that are biased and small states get almost no exposure from the opposite side of the canidacy because they know they have almost no chance of winning their votes. This seems to force the voters to choose one canidate's electors because they don't know enough about the other.

In conclusion, the Electorial College needs to be replaced with a more fair, balanced system. It has the potential to allow the electors to defy the will of the people who voted them in, invalidating the people's votes and making them pointless. It also has candates only focusing their ads and visits on the states with more votes and the states biased towards their party. Finally, it has almost all the states have a landslide ""winner-takes_all"" style of awarding electorial votes. This means if one side of electors only wins by a slim margin, the other side gets nothing, even though since they lost by a small number they clearly have a sizeable amount of voters for them. The Electorial College needs to be removed before someone takes advantage of it's serious flaws and takes the votes of the people and makes them useless.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
A3A5003C8AD1,"Bearded dragons are a popular pet choice for many people, but before bringing one into your home, it's important to understand their dietary, lighting, and temperature requirements, as well as their social needs and behavior. Additionally, it's important to choose the right housing, insects, and reptile calcium to feed the bearded dragon, and establish a routine for handling and exercising it. Finally, it's important to have a plan for increasing the size of the housing as the bearded dragon grows bigger.

Dietary Requirements:
Bearded dragons are omnivores and require a balanced diet consisting of both plant and animal matter. They need a variety of vegetables, fruits, and insects to meet their nutritional needs. It's important to ensure that the vegetables and fruits are fresh and have a high nutritional content. Bearded dragons also require calcium and vitamin D supplements to prevent health issues such as metabolic bone disease.

Lighting Requirements:
Bearded dragons require a specific type of light to regulate their circadian rhythm and maintain their natural behaviors. They need a combination of UVB and UVA light, which can be provided by a specialized light source such as a UVB/UVA lamp. The intensity and duration of the light source should be adjusted according to the age and health of the bearded dragon.

Temperature Requirements:
Bearded dragons are ectothermic, which means they cannot regulate their body temperature internally. They require a stable and consistent temperature range of around 70-80°F during the day and 65-70°F at night. This can be achieved by using a heat lamp and a thermometer to monitor the temperature in the enclosure.

Social Needs and Behavior:
Bearded dragons are social animals and require interaction with their human caretakers. They enjoy being handled and played with, but it's important to do so in a gentle and respectful manner. Bearded dragons also require a secure and stimulating environment to prevent boredom and stress. Providing them with toys, branches, and other objects to explore can help meet their social needs.

Housing:
Bearded dragons require a secure and spacious enclosure that allows for movement and exploration. The",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0

Many people say that we are not alone in this universe. Some people say diffrent planets have secret life forms on it. But, i dont think believe that a face on Mars was created by another life form beside humans. There has been theries for centurys about space, that we are not alone and people from diffrent planets exsist. I dont think so because it there were other life forms out there why havent they made contact.

Space is full of adventure, discovery, and wonder but to come to the realization that there are other life form beside or own. It would change how people think and would change reality forever. They put aliens on movies and telivision for entertainment only not to be taken into content. The face on Mars is just a creation of all the space debry and the astroieds that hit Mars and have sculpted in to resembling a human figure or ( human face).

The face on Mars maybe could have been there for a long time before but, we just didnt descover it till now. People dont know how large space really is. They just know what people till them or what they have discovered, but why would aliens really exsist? Some people say there is life on all planest and we are not looking hard enough.

Even if there were life on diffrent planents why would we just be hearing about it now and not sooner. What the picture actually showa is the Martian equivqlent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.

This passage states ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a strudent is becoming confused or bored,"" ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" people understand human facial expression, computers need to know the same,because many hours of our lives are spent behind a computer screen.

Is facial expressions a science? Dr. Paul Eckman ""has classified six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness"" these are all emotions we can see in person and we all respond differently when we see these emotions. In paragraph five ""For instance, you can tell gow a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This states the us as human beings notice and feel emotion linked to others in our lives.""Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communcate"" In the artical is states ""For ecample, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen,a similar ad mkght follow"" This shows that the computer notices the smile and links that with happness or enjoyment.

59f4a7cf,"The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it. The Electoral College was a smart idea in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds, but as our country continues to change, it is necessary to change the way that we elect our leaders. The Electoral College has remained untouched and exactly the same for hundreds of years and this has caused it to be extremely outdated. Not only is it far too outdated and complicated to help our voting process, but the Electoral College does not give the voters voice instead, it takes it away from them. The Electoral College also can lead to concerning situations that the country and its people do not want to be put in. For these reasons, I strongly encourage you to make the change and switch to election by popular vote.

The question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. Our country is changing day by day, and we certainly have made monumental changes since the Electoral College came to be. According to Bradford Plumer, author of, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" a poll was taken by gallop in the year 2000 that showed that less than just forty percent of Americans support the election system that we have now. This proves that it is time for a change and that the system that we currently have in place has been in place for far too long. The everchanging United States of America is in desperate need of an uptodate election system that fits the current needs of the American people. The Electoral College is not only outdated, but it is also an extremely complex voting method. In an article entitled, ""What Is the Electoral College,"" written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method.

Moreover, the Electoral College should no longer be the voting method of the American people because the people are given no voice with the Electoral College process. In his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a nondemocratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.

Most importantly, using the Electoral College as our voting method can lead to some serious problems. The replacing of electors that oppose the popular vote result is a problem that comes with using the Electoral College. Not only is it not hard to accomplish, but it has happened before. According to Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote.

In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.",0,train_essays,,2
CC207E107BB9,"Dear principal,

I don't think making it necessary to do community service is a good idea. Community service is a good thing to do, but not everyone has the time to do it. Some people are in extra curricular activities that involve staying after school. Some might be doing things after school that take time away. Other kids get too much homework that it takes them all night to finish it all. Parents or guardians might not be able to drive their child to the place needed. Students might fall short of grade expectations because they don't have enough time to do their homework or they aren't rested enough to pay attention. Community service should be a choice, not something that you have to do in order to pass. Yes, community service is important, but should not be required. Community service should be something you want to do and on your own will, not be forced to do against your own will. There's barely enough time for me to do my homework, read, go to dance and still be well rested for tomorrow. I have no free time. Doing community service would mean staying up late and sleeping only a few hours each night which leads to bad grades because I can't focus which means remediation and possibly failing the eighth grade.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

I think it's a really good idea of letting us use our phones during lunch periods and other free time.

I also believe we students should deserve some kind of free time for our selves to enjoy on our cell phones. Also it's a good way for us to take stuff off our mind like getting a bad grade on a assignment. it would be a good idea to put our cell phones on silence for the teachers wont get irritated like they usually do.

I think policy one is the best choice for our school. Policy two wouldn't be such a great policy for our school because considering the fact that we wont have phones at school at all is more torture for us students during free times, lunch, and during periods.

7B751C9BE162,"When you are seeking for advice, why do you often find yourself asking multiple people for their opinions? What is so beneficial about asking multiple people for their opinions on a topic they may not know much about? How does it help you make a better choice? I can answer that question for you.

When seeking for advice is can be about anything, family, friends or just general decision making. Let's come up with an example, Generic_Name was friends with a group of kids since childhood, she starts to lose touch with them and realizes how much she needed them in her life but she doesn't know how to approach them or talk to them anymore. she decides to ask her older brother for advice, he tells her that she shouldn't even try but if she really wanted to then she should

""just be straight up with them"". Her brother only says this because he dislikes some of Generic_Name's friends and finds them annoying. She doesn't really like that idea so she decides to ask someone else for their opinion. The way everyone problem solves and views things is different, not everyone has the same mindset which is why its important to hear multiple point of views.

When someone knows less about a situation it is sometimes better because they see everything from an outside perspective creating a less bias opinion or neutral opinion. When you ask multiple different people for advice on one topic, you are searching for a general opinion/ idea or a pattern in what people have to say to then influence your decision. If you chose not hear from a few people one persons opinion may be bias and can heavily influence your decision in a good or bad way. Hearing many different sides can help you come to a better conclusion of your own because you can then weigh out the pros and cons of your situation. Everyone's point of view will be different like that of your 13 year old friend who is your age and knows you very personally or of your 72 year old grandmother. Your friend may know you well but your grandmother has lived longer as has possibly experienced the same things you are currently experiencing. Each has its own benefit and can help add onto your thought process.

You make better choices when you have the opportunity to properly think things through. In order to do that you have to give your self time. When talking to different people you are forcibly giving your self that time to process and think about what your next move will be. This gives you a clearer mind and opens up a better way of seeing things. After that like I have stated before, you can use other peoples opinions to build off of your own. It also imperative to look at all angles of your situation because you may not being seeing important factors that can help you problem solve that someone else may see.

In conclusion, there are many reasons as to why should always ask more than one person when seeking for advice on an issue. Not only will you be building your knowledge on how to deal with those kind of situations but you are also learning how to put together ideas to form your own. Asking multiple people will push you to think more and create a well thought out plan. You also learn not rely on one specific person just in case their opinion is bias when it comes to a certain topic. That is why I believe that seeking advice from multiple people can help you make a better choice.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
llama_70b_v1581,"I think dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. One reason is that it helps kids focus on their school work instead of being distracted by what other people are wearing. Like, if someone is wearing a really short skirt or a shirt with a bad word on it, it can be really distracting and make it hard for other kids to pay attention. By having a dress code, it helps kids to focus on their work and not be distracted by what other people are wearing.

Another reason is that dress codes can help prevent bullying. If everyone is wearing the same kind of clothes, then no one will stand out and be made fun of. Like, if someone is wearing a weird shirt or pants, they might get teased by other kids. But if everyone is wearing the same uniform, then no one will get teased and everyone will be treated equally.

Also, dress codes can help create a sense of community and equality. When everyone is wearing the same uniform, it shows that everyone is equal and that no one is better than anyone else. It also helps kids to feel like they belong to a community, like they are all part of the same team.

But, some people might say that dress codes are bad because they restrict kids from expressing themselves. They might say that kids should be able to wear whatever they want and express their individuality. But, I think that kids can still express themselves in other ways, like through their personality and their work.

In conclusion, I think dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. They help kids focus on their work, prevent bullying, and create a sense of community and equality.

DB4A32DD7A9E,"Transportation takes up most of our time. Many of us sit in the cars waiting to get to a place without realizing that we actually spend more time in our car. Transportation is the second leading cause for the emissions in the United States. Car-Free cities are starting to trend in Europe. In the car-free cities you no longer have to worry about where to park. We need to lower the amount of emissions we produce on a daily bases, for America most of our emissions are from gas while in Paris the emissions come from diesel.

Paris has been really polluted, there is much smog that they had decided to ban driving, whoever drove recieved a fine on that day. Paris would take turns on the license plate number to determine if you could drive that day or not. A car-free day in Bogota, Colombia had many people walking, hiking and taking the bus. The streets were free or almost free from traffic jam,violaters who did not participate were fined.

Obama has recently announced that he would like for America to lower the emissions we produce. Statistics show that less people are purchasing cars also there are less people getting their drivers license. In Vauban, Germany they do not just go a day without cars, it is a suburb where street parking are forbidden, it is an expermental site where people are to be without cars. People from there are much happier they no longer have to worry about traffic or congestion they just walk, ride a bike or bus. 70% of Vauban families do not own a car. Cars can cause us to be stressed and it even harms the enviroment.

The advantages would be we'd be more calm and relaxed people rather then trying to hurry and speed in a car. We would also have much clean air. The money that the city gets from the violators would be used to make the community a much better and clean place. Although it is limited it does not mean you cannot use your car, but you may want to live in another area if you keep getting fined. Many people if they choose to walk or ride a bike will become more fit and healthy. Maybe we should consider it even if its just for a day it makes all the difference.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

I should have never done what I did but it happened and I can't take it back. I got caught and now I have to do the right thing. I whip out my phone and press the face time button to talk to my best friend about what is going on. ""Hey Generic_Name."" I managed to say while holding back tears, ""I really need your advice on something."" I say more serious now but facing the camera towards the ceiling. ""Okay, what's up?"" She replies sounding concerned. ""I talked about Generic_Name behind her back with a few other people and I said some pretty hurtful things. The only reason I said those things is because everybody else was and I don't know."" I start rambling and need to slow down. ""Anyways she messaged me this morning saying that she found out what I said and it really hurt her feelings. Now I feel awful and I need your advice on how to apologize."" I squeaked. ""Were the other girls talking bad about her too?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Yeah, even worse than me."" I yelp. ""That's not what I heard."" She starts but I cut her off short, ""Wait what? You already heard about this?"" She chuckles while managing to say, ""Yeah, almost everybody has heard, but they said it was just you being mean and I believe them."" I can feel the tears streaming down my face as I end the call without replying to her. People should seek multiple opinions when in need of advice because it will not be as bias, they might not know any better than you, and you can hear from people who have different meaning in your life.

First off, you should seek multiple opinions when in need of advice because the advice will not be as bias. When you seek advice from someone you want to know what they would do in your shoes, but sometimes they might not tell you the full truth because they are bias. For example, my little brother, Generic_Name, really wanted a monster truck for his birthday. He decided to ask his friend if that is what he should ask for just so that he doesn't regret it. Well, it turns out that his friend also really wanted a monster truck but his birthday wasn't for months. So his friend told him not to ask for it because he would regret it but the real reason is because he didn't want Generic_Name to get it first. This is why you should seek more than one opinion because the person you ask for help might not actually want to help you, just themselves. For instance, my neighbor, Generic_Name, went on a trip to Hawaii with her friends. While she was there she got into an argument with one of them and she felt really bad afterwards. So she asked a different friend named Generic_Name what she should do. Generic_Name said that she should quit worrying as much and not do anything for the friend she was arguing with. Little did Generic_Name know that Generic_Name didn't like the friend she argued with which is why he told her not to do anything about it. Luckily, Generic_Name was smart enough to ask another friend who said she should get the friend flowers. Generic_Name decided to get the flowers and they made up. This is just example of why you shouldn't just ask one person for advice. They could be completely bias and you wouldn't even notice.

Next, you should seek multiple opinions when in need of advice because the person might not know any better than you. Picture this, Generic_Name is in Hawaii with her friends and they came across a cliff that lead into the water if you jumped off. Most of her friends convinced Generic_Name to go first. Right when Generic_Name was getting ready to jump one of her friends stopped her and said they would go check the water first to make sure there weren't any rocks. Turns out, there were tons and that could have seriously injured Generic_Name if she had listened to her other friends. Her friends did not want her to get hurt, they just didn't know any better. A further example is when my mom went to get groceries and forgot what kind of yogurt we get and called me to check. I asked my little brother to do it for me and he said it was the Light and Fit brand and it was organic. So that is what I told my mom. I decided to double check to be sure and found out that it was also gluten free so I immediately told my mom the correct kind. Now this would have resulted poorly because my dad is allergic to gluten and he eats that yogurt a lot. Once again sometimes people aren't trying to give you bad advice or make you do the wrong thing they just do not know any better which is why you always should have multiple opinions.

Finally, you should seek multiple opinions when in need of advice so you can hear from people who have different meaning in your life What I mean by this is when you really need advice and nobody is available besides a peer you barely talk to than their advice will not have enough meaning or importance to even consider what they are saying. For instance, If they tell you that they think you were in the wrong, you might think that they don't even know you that well so why would they be right. Even if they are right about you being wrong. Which is why you have to hear multiple opinions. If you just hear from that person that doesn't have meaning in your life you will only agree with them if you like what you are hearing. Rather than if you talk to your older sister about it and they say that you are in the wrong you are way more likely to consider that and believe it. Studies show that 9 out of 10 people say they would always believe a best friend over a coworker no matter what the situation is.

In conclusion, I decided to ask my friend Generic_Name for advice because she doesn't go to my school and won't be as bias. She told me I should apologize to Generic_Name and tell her the full truth. Generic_Name thanked me and cleared up everything. People should seek multiple opinions when in need of advice because it won't be as bias, they might not know any better than you, and you can hear from people with different meaning in your life. ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
401940D9830D,"Imagine walking into a new school year, having already learned some of the topics your teachers will teach this year and still memorize some of the stuff from last year. Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer to assure students continue to learn over their summer break. Should students be able to design what they want their projects to be or should the teachers design it? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers will pick educated projects for their students, it will be harder for the teachers to answer questions and grade individual projects that the students came up with their self, they will know for sure the projects taught students things for their upcoming year. Here is all the reasons why the teachers should design the summer break projects.

First, students might pick uneducated projects to do. Teachers will pick projects that help relate to what they learned in the class room. For example, students might pick what they are interest in, instead of picking what they need to learn to better their learning experience over the summer. Teachers are more likely educated than students about what the students will learn in there next grade level. So for instances, they will give them projects based off what students will need to know next year, to further their education for the next grade there are entering in. For these reasons teachers should be the one's to choose the projects for summer.

Second, it will be easier for the teachers to answer question and grade the projects. If a student gets stuck and need help from a teacher, they can email the teacher an ask for help. If it was student-designed each student might have an individual project. It will be harder for the teacher to answer all of the questions, because he or she did not pick the project for the student. If the teachers come together they can figure out the right projects that can benefit the students education. This is another example for why the teachers should design the students projects.

Lastly, some students might say that, by letting them design their own projects. It will not be boring and it will increase the rates of students actually doing the different projects over the summer. It will also make students put more effort into their individual projects. However, if they let the students decide then how will they know if their learning anything from there projects. It will be way easier if the teacher choose it because then they will know for sure they will learn something educational while doing the projects.

In conclusion, they should make the projects over the break teacher-designed, because teachers can give out educational projects, the students can ask questions about the projects the teachers have choosing and it is more easier for the teachers to grade, and they know that the teachers will choose what is best for the students to help them get through the year. To make it easier for the teachers they can all agree on what educational fun projects they want the students to do over the summer.                                                                                                                     ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Asking For Advise

What is something you are good at? This answer varies for different people based on a couple of different things. When asking for advice, we ask more that one person because different people are good at different things based on their experiences and opinions. When we are uncertain about something and we get feedback from other people, we will feel more confident in that decision.

Everyone has had a different life, some are similar, but none are the same. Since everyone has had a different life, different people have different experiences. For example, someone named Generic_Name might go to a store on Monday, and have a terrible experience there because they did not have what he was looking for. Someone else named get could go to that same store, on the same day, and have a great experience just because she was looking for something else. She and Generic_Name would be looking for different items based on the different lives they live. If another person named Generic_Name wanted to know which store to go to, she might ask both Generic_Name and Generic_Name. However, since they both had such different experiences, Generic_Name might want to know a third person's experience. She might ask another person whether or not she should go to this store, and based on what their experience was, they might tip the scales in one direction or another. The differences in our lives are based on the way that we live our lives.

Everyone has a different opinion. There are opinions about whether or not someone believes in something, opinions about someone is doing the right thing, opinions about what the right thing is, and many, many more. This is why, when people are looking for advise, they go to more than one person. They want to get as much feedback as possible because they think they are giving themselves the best resources to succeed.

Many people lack confidence in their decisions. However, there is a solution that can help them more every time they do it. The more people that you have to back up your decision, the more confident you feel about it. If someone is not feeling confident in their decision, when another person comes and tells them that it is the right decision, they feel more confident about it. In order to feel confident in their choices, a person needs support.

People want to know how to make the best decision and the way that they do that is by asking for advice. When someone is unsure about whether or not their choice is the right one and they ask another person, that person is boosting their confidence. The reason that people ask more than one person for advice, is so that they can be confident in their choice, have a variety of opinions, and know what other people have experienced. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Cars can also get you there quicker, but its not worth what we are doing to our environment and ourselves. There are three major advantages about limiting your car use. It will help out our environment with the air pollution you can hear the peacefulness of birds and kids playing, and its a financial rest.

First and foremost, it will help out with our air pollution. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...""14. The gas we use to fuel up our vehicles is polluting the environment when we use it. If we used Paris as an example, we can have odd and even driving days for odd and even license plates 11. That means only half the people with cars would be driving on the road each day which could alter the air pollution. Another reliable example is Bogota, once a year they have a car free day to limit the air pollution 20. Carlos Arturo Plaza believes, ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" 24.

In addition, the neighborhood or city you are in wouldn't be as loud. Have you ever imagined a peaceful environment with no car horns or engine? Heidrun Walter said she was always tense and now she is happy without her car, because she can hear the swiss of bicycles and the chatterring of children playing 3. Rarely do I ever have peaceful moments unless I'm inside school, or at the neighborhood library. For example, a peaceful walk to school can mentally prepare me for my day ahead, and save my mother gas money.

The amount of money one pays for a car could be equilvalent to amount some else pays for their house. Also, when you get the car, you have to put gas in it for your engine to power up. Limited car use wouldn't just effect you as a person, but the economy as a whole. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport"" 9. If we reduced our car usage, the United States wouldn't have to spend 80 percent of appropriations to highways and they could even it out more to other transportation use. Plus, if you didn't have to pay for gas every week just imagine how much money that would save you.

Limited car use doesn't just effect you financially, but it also contributes positively to the environment. In additon, more peaceful moments can be added to your agenda of things to do. Cars are reliable for their speed and transportation, but when it comes to long term effects, I don't know if its really worth the risk.",0,train_essays,,2
736E8C8444E6,"Technology has become an integral part of our lives, and its impact on people's lives is significant. The advancements in technology have brought about many positive and negative changes in various aspects of our lives, including relationships, buying items online, and spending time with family.

On the positive side, technology has allowed people to connect with others from different parts of the world, making it easier for them to maintain relationships. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have made it possible for people to keep in touch with friends and family who live far away. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to buy items online, saving them time and effort. Online shopping has become more convenient, and people can purchase items from the comfort of their homes.

However, technology has also brought about some negative effects on people's lives. For instance, technology has made it easier for people to become isolated and disconnected from others. People often spend more time on their devices than interacting with others, leading to a decline in face-to-face communication skills. Furthermore, technology has made it easier for people to buy items online, leading to a decline in local businesses and a loss of jobs.

Technology has also impacted how people spend time with their families. While technology has made it possible for families to stay connected even when they are apart, it has also made it easier for people to become distracted and spend less time with their families. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to work from home, leading to a decline in the quality of family time.

Furthermore, technology has allowed people to complete tasks without contact with others, leading to a decline in interpersonal skills. People often rely on technology to complete tasks such as ordering food, booking appointments, and paying bills, reducing the need for human interaction.

In terms of children, technology has become an essential part of their lives. Children often use technology to learn, play, and connect with others. However, parents should put limits on their children's technology use to ensure that they are developing the necessary interpersonal skills and maintaining a healthy balance between technology use and other activities.

7B1E55213D00,"Technology is becoming a bigger part of our lives. As time goes on, we develop new technology for different purposes. One such purpose is to read emotions. This technology will benefit our society in different ways, like in education. The technology to read students emotions is valuable to our schools.

The first way in which this technology is vaulable to schools is by improving lessons. Often times, many students of different calibers are thrust into the same classroom. While some grow bored others become confused by the content of the lesson. In the article, Dr. Huang is quoted saying, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" and then ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. If we implemented this emotion recognition technology, we could help students of all levels grow and reach their potential.

Another reason why technology that can recognize emotions is vaulable in schools is because of fighting and bullying. In paragraphs three and four of the article, it discusses how the technology works and what it can do. It claims that it can dectect mixed emotions and even, in paragraph 8, detect fake smiling. This technology could be used to detect when students are angry and wanting to fight or even sad from being bullied. Teachers cannot always detect these things from students, especially if they are trying to hide them.

In addition to stopping fights and helping bullied students, this emotion recognition technology could assist in identifying students who have problematic home lives and need help. Although this would not always be 100% accurate, it could help faculty see those students who might be depressed or angry, and need help. This would aid in making schools a happier place. It could also negate problems that they could have later in life. Installing this technology in our schools would be highly beneficial.

Schools need the technology to read students emotions. It would fit in with other technological advancements that have improved our education system. Advances in technology helped to improve not just our education, but our overall lives. Numerous people in our world cannot live without technology. Technology is important to our society.

9535998EE972,""" Phones & Driving ""

Have you ever really asked yourself how bad or life-threatening, texting while driving actually is? What about; actually analyzing whether it should/or shouldn't be legal or illegal for people to use their phones while driving? If you haven't already, let's take this time to thoroughly examine and /or analyze this controversial topic. Some people argue that texting while driving should be allowed because; they most likely haven't yet been in an accident while they were texting and driving. Others argue that it shouldn't be allowed for the sole reason that it is: deadly, life-threatening and scary.

Imagine being in (a) / your car doing your daily task; driving/ or going to school, work, or to run errands and suddenly you get hit from the back, the front, or the side by another car, who hit you because they were irresponsible enough to be on their phones while they were driving... traumatizing experience to even think about right? I don't know about you, but most people would agree with the most logical decision that would not only benefit but also insure our safety a little more. Research made; shows various reports that claim that, this year there has been close to '4,000 deaths' due to the distracted drivers. That's a crazy number don't you think? It's actually even been higher than that at one point. Pretty sad, I know.

Now, put yourself in the opposite position; you're the driver who so irresponsibly and recklessly is using their phone while driving... you're thinking it's no big deal to check your phone for a ""quick minute"" 'while the light's on red' or you're at a ""driving stopping point"". Then comes the part where the car in front of you, brakes and since you're too busy on your phone you don't notice and continue driving hitting the car in front of you, causing impact to both cars. This one reckless mistake can make you cause not only your life but someone else's. That one careless decision can either take your life or make you continue living a life with regrets, sadness, and trammua. Most people wouldn't bear such experience.

I know what you're thinking now; you're probably saying something to yourself like:

""ugh. I've heard that many times but it hasn't happened to me, because I'm not that reckless and I pay good attention"" but, how would you feel knowing that the odds aren't that low??? The odds of an accident happening due to using your phone while driving are insanely high, majority of the people would consider minimizing those chances by simply not using phones while driving, for the SAKE of your life, and our lives! If making it illegal to use or phones' while driving, is what it takes to keep us safe on the road and would also minimize the death rates due to 'phones and driving', then so be it, right?

We all want to live a longer and healthier life, so we can all agree that keeping/ or making the usage of our phones while driving illegal, is the best choice. In life there are only so many things we can do to prevent our deaths, that if we have the opportunity /or the solution, then we should take it and act upon it. You can always use your phone just wait those 30 minutes or however long it's going to take you because that phone and those messages, videos etc., will always be there but you can't bring a life back, you can't take that one mistake back, you can't fix things but you prevent these things. So...'stay off the phone and just look at the road'!!!      ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
F8CDAD03758D,"Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I feel that we the students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school. Some students need cell phones because their parents need to know when they get out of school. Parents pick up their children from school when they leave. Suppose that a student has to suddenly stay late for basketball practice. If the student doesn't have a cell phone, when the parent comes when they usually do, the student won't be there to be picked up. Thus, resulting in the student not having a ride home.

Students should be able to use their phones during free time. Now with all the social network sites like Facebook and Twitter, students want to be able to be updated on what's going on. Also students like to surf the web and go on Youtube and do other enjoyable things. The students would get a chance to text or email other friends that may not be at the same school. I feel that it will give the students, like myself , a sense of independence being able to use phones.

Now I know why you may want students to not use phones. Students can cheat on tests by looking online or texting. Also you don't want students to text during class and other times when they shouldn't. That's why after lunch and free times you should do a cell phone check to see if the students turn off their phones. If you were to find at least 50 phones on, then you can take cell phone days away for a week. To me that sounds like a fair exchange.

All in all I hope you decide to go with policy 1. It is a better and more fair choice for the student body. Please take this letter in consideration. Thank you.

DCE93861CC17,"Have you ever came home and been tired but had to finish something? If you answered with yes, imagine if you had to do at least one extra activity after school. I believe that we should'nt be forced to do extracurricular activity because you might be tired after school, have to work, or help around the house after school.

My first reason is, maybe your tired after school. all of us has been tired at least once after school and wanted to sleep for a bit instead of doing your homework right away or maybe you were possibly hungry. Maybe you were sleepy and wanted to sleep for 30 minutes and then grab something to eat after you woke up from your nap.

Maybe you wanted to eat something because you haven't ate all day and its better to relax your mind instead of going right into work after school.

My second reason, is that maybe your old enough to work and have a after school job you work at for a couple of hours. You might have a job and have to work right after school and you dont come home until dark and its hard for you to do anything else after you get off work because you have to do your homework and then head to bed for the next day of school. Another thing is that maybe your schedule will be ruined if you have to do an extracurricular activity after school cause of the time and the time you might have to work, can interfere with your time schedule.

The last and final reason, is that you have to watch over your siblings after school or pet sit your neighbors dogs and walk and feed them. Sometimes, you have to watch your younger brothers or sisters and you are busy most of the time to get anything else done. The other thing is that if your parents dont come home until late you might also have to clean the house and do other things such as wash the plates, throw the trash out and many more.

Which brings me to my conclusion, we shouldnt have to do an extracurricular activities because you might be tired or you have to work and or take care of the house, So in my opinion I don't think we should have to do anything extra after school instead take the rest of the day off.                  ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
BC0D8223C604,"Mr. and Mrs. Smith get prepared for the elections, which is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. They're both really assured on who they are electing, Mr. Keen, the remarkable Republican canidate. Mr. Keen would most definitely operate in Mr. and Mrs. Smiths' favor, due to the fact that Keen offers a convinient medical insurance for they're family, opposes of abortion and is projecting sites for the unemployed individuals. Clearly, candidate Mr. Keen is a go for the Smiths'  family, but what if they're doomed of their vote not getting qualified due to the systems', such as the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a ominous process, due to the fact that voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, disvalues ones' citizenship rights and it's going to influence the country of not voting.

Firstly, the Electoral College is a cynical process where not everyones' vote is taking account of. Imagine, voting in the upcoming election in vain knowing that organizations that only select the votes of one entire state, unconsious of the other millions individuals in the other surplus of the nation exist. The possibility of the one in fifty states choosing majorly one particular candidate, is highly risky for the goverment, and no one should permit putting in risk the goverment with this stubborn prefrence of electoral votes. Incontestably, the Electoral College System, is not a method of voting that should be unresposibly utilized to advantage the four years of presidency.  Secondly, voting is a stupendous privilege that allows' one to vote in the adulthood stage. Perhaps, because in the adulthood stage one is aware of all the current economic situations and one is noticable of the advantages a former president can serve them. The former citizens' privileges are unfortunately disvalued lately, with the Electoral College system. It's dreadful that the anticipation a legal individual once awaited on, can no longer be celebrated or reinacted, with this fashion of electing states, that manage the majority votes of the respective candidate. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? That results in a false and negative answer. Thence, it is more than clear that the old-fashion and benevolent method of regrouping all the cadenced voices of all the recievable votes is appropate and suitable for the public and president.  Thirdly, the Electoral college influences countries to not participate in the privilege of voting. Once the citizens, have the knowledge of these unprudent organizations, voting is going to be outlooked as an petition, that isn't necessary of taking toll of. Due to the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing'' states. The pending thought, that ones' state might be chosen out of the many, is certainly doubtful. The Electoral College, can upbring wins in the popular votes but lost in the presidency, these democracies need to be abolished because it should be a doubt that the President and the opposed public, should be uncondemed of. Clearly, the definition of this service is dooming and should be reinforced from the Constitution, to prevent the countrys' votes from going unknown. It is at time, at last, to conclude all the disadvantages of the Electoral College in one, it's ominous due to the fact that the public votes not for the president, but for a state of electors, disvalues ones' citizenship rights and influences' the country of not voting. The opression against the Electoral College, has it's witty motives. As we all know, the most popular partys are the Republic and Democrat. If the Electoral College, only selects one state out of the entire nation, that allows one states, that carries one culture of people to form the regimen of the rules of that successful party. No goverment, should suit this fashion, because it isn't right in any shape or form.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
C3D8E8E8B942,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-desdigned or students-designed?

These summer projects should be student-designed for varies reasons such as, engagment, vaction, and lastly, confidence.

Students during the summer have many things to worry about like having a job, looking after siblings or even their mental health and the last thing on their mind is a techer-designed project. The projects given throughout the summer should be student-designed becuase it allows the student to be engaged. The student will be more engaged because it is a topic that they want to learn about and being engaged shows that the student is willing to learn and is very intrested in his or her own topic. Typically, when a teacher assigns a project to a student, the student isn't very pleased and with that being said, it could affect the amount of effort and the desire that the students puts into actually learning.

Secondly, these projects also need to be student-designed because of summer experiences. During the summer, alot of students grow. Vaction plays a big role in the students growth and development, as the students travel they pick up more and more knowledge, which expands their knowldege and could possibly change thier perception of things, making it easier for them to have better ideas and to do well on their summer projects.

Lastly, student-designed projects over break leads to confidence. Because the student has had the freedom of choosing what he or she wants to learn about, it just makes it easier for the students to showcase their work with pride. Pride meaning, showing that the student has learned and is more than comfortable to enlighten others. To have confidence about what you have put alot of time into and worked on is an important skill to develop because the student will surely use it some other time in their lifetime.

In conclusion, these summer projects should be student-designed because it will surely keep the student engaged in his or her own learning and add a little more excitement to the students vacation because the project is something they are eager to learn and work on. Lastly student-designed projects will help build the students confidence because they know what they are talking about.",0,original_moth,Task: Write an essay comparing the benefits of summer projects being student-designed versus teacher-designed.,6
7443D525E32D,"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

The American Education System has grown a lot since it was originally curated. While I do believe there have been positives to have come from today's educational system, I also believe there are improvements that can be made. One important improvement would be the ability to attend classes online. I believe students would benefit very well from attending classes from home, due to the style of today's stress-inducing form of schooling.

First of all, this would be very beneficial because attending classes from home would help relieve stress from students with social anxieties or anxieties involving the typical school format. The stress levels of students has grown exponentially in the passed couple of decades, and I've seen it first hand. Students are growing more and more anxious as the expectations to get good grades, get into a good school, and follow a career in STEM become higher. How are we to expect our students handle these sort of worries while also trying to balance a social life? My younger sister has aspired to be many things; including a doctor, a biologist, and even a detective. But do to her hyper-thyroidism she has been held back by her medical testings and re-diagnosis' during the school year. This has caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety--but after many meetings and emails between my parents and the school, she was accommodated with home bound. Home bound is a form of at-home schooling that allows her to take some classes from home and work with teachers outside of school hours in order to help her get caught up.

Second of all, attending classes from home would allow for more flexibility when it comes to the scheduling of classes, and potentially assignment deadlines. If a student struggles to balance school, extra-curricular activities, and a job, they would probably find online classes to be very beneficial. When taking classes online, students are usually allowed for more freedom and flexibility. They can sleep in until noon, and then work on a class in the evening. Or if they work to help support their family, they can get up early, get their school work done, and work a job in the afternoon. Most online classes are scheduled similarly to college courses, and will allow students to plan when during the week they wish to take certain classes. My younger sister, who I spoke of earlier, has found this to be very beneficial, and something she will miss once she can fully reimmerse herself into a regular school schedule.

Lastly, attending classes from home would allow for more involvement of the parent in the students education. Some parents do not get a full scope of what is going on in a students school day, and it can sometimes be hard for kids to communicate this to their parents. Some parents tend to job the gun when they take a look at their grades and are seeing their kid isn't doing too well, but what they aren't always considering is the other factors that go into it. A students grade could be reflective of not only their work ethic and focus, but how well a teacher is teaching them, and the sort relationships between other kids in the class. If a parent is able to be present when a student is working on their courses, they would be able to get a full scope of how their student learns. Not only that, but the student would have less distractions from other kids, and hopefully be able to avoid some of the flaws of an individual teachers style of teaching.

Now while I do believe others would combat my claim with statements such as, ""today's educational system has done amazing and has left many students with successful careers in medicine and engineering"". But to that I would say; there have also been many successful people in history such as scientist, Albert Einstein and entrepreneur, Gary Vee, who either dropped out of high school or didn't find themselves doing so great until university. That is why I believe students would benefit very well from attending classes from home, to help relieve the stress of today's school system. ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
D9469EFAE287," I am going to start explaining and giving my opinion on the topic of technology. In my view, technology has had a significant impact on the world and has made our daily lives more convenient. For example, transportation has become easier due to advancements in technology. Today, we have access to our own cars or public transportation, allowing us to travel anywhere without any problems. Additionally, we can now fly to any country in the world, making it easier to explore new places.

In my opinion, technology has a positive impact on our daily lives. It has made our daily necessities more accessible and convenient. For example, we can now learn about any topic online, making it easier for students to access information and learn about what they are interested in. Furthermore, technology has made it easier for people to communicate with each other, regardless of their location.

Technology is constantly evolving and will continue to do so in the future. For example, in the past, it was difficult to communicate with family and friends who were far away. However, with the invention of the telephone, it became easier to communicate with them. Today, we have access to smartphones that allow us to do much more than just make calls.

BE4764F7BFF1,"The Downside of Online Classes

A couple of schools offer online classes through virtual videos and video conferencing for students to take from home. Some schools might think that students would benefit from this and others think that this is not a good idea. From my perspective, students would not benefit from taking online classes for many reasons such as; they could get distracted easily, they miss out interacting with teachers and students, and they would eventually get bored of online school at home.

To begin with, many students K though 12th grade get distracted easily. The distraction is not because we don't want to do the work, but it's our minds. Everyone's minds work in a different way and theres always going to be that part of us that gets distracted by the small things around us. Also, technology is somewhat of an issue because it distracts many people because of the games and many apps that it has. Students could go off task and go off playing games or watching videos while they are supposed to be learning and doing their work online. For example, sometimes even I get distracted while doing my work at home through my computer or smart device because of the many other things I could be doing instead of doing homework. There are many distractions online and around us that could make us go off task instead of keeping us focused to do our work.

Furthermore, many students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff. In other words, when you are taking online classes the only person there with you would be your teacher, whom is communicating with you through your computer. No one else would be there with you to help you through it, everything would have to be on your own. Ultimately, if you are in a school many teachers and students would be there to assist you with any questions or concerns that you might have. Also, you would miss out on a lot more exciting events such as school dances,

football games, and pep rallies. There is so much that you would miss out if you wouldn't go to a public school and decided to take online school instead.

Ultimately, you would also be spending almost all day in your house because of online classes. A regular school day is about 8 hours, meaning the online classes would be about the same time , or more or less. In school 8 hours is already tiring enough because of the learning and listening, but think of 8 hours at home with no breaks in between, that would be extremely exhausting. Almost all students that attend school come for a full 8 hour day, which includes break in between classes, then once school is over they go back home to be able to relax. If you are at home for 8 hours doing work, you wouldn't want to spend time relaxing at your home because eventually it would get boring there after a while. In my experience being at home gets boring to the point where I don't know what else to do to not be bored at home. In other words, being in the same place for a whole day would get boring and uncomfortable.

On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes. They are in favor of taking online classes through video conferencing. Some of the schools think that online classes are a good idea because many students could possibly avoid drama, get 1 on 1 assistance, and learn quicker. Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary. Online school should only be necessary if a student does not feel safe at their school because of personal reasons.

Overall, online classes are not a good idea at all unless it is necessary because of safety issues. Besides that, it would not be a good idea because many students would get distracted when they are supposed to be doing work, students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff, and they would spend most of their day at home which is unhealthy.",0,original_moth,"Task: Analyze the potential pros and cons of students taking online classes from home, especially in K-12.",0

Extending the School Day: Yay or Nay?

As an 8th grader, I think it's pretty cool when we get to sleep in an extra hour on Fridays. But, have you ever thought about extending the school day? Like, what if we went to school for six hours instead of five? I know, I know, it sounds like a lot, but hear me out.

So, the pros of extending the school day are pretty cool. For one, we would get more learning time. I mean, who doesn't love learning? And, if we got more time in the classroom, we could probably learn more stuff. Plus, it would give us more time to do stuff like sports and clubs, which are super fun. And, think about it, if we went to school for six hours instead of five, we would have more time to hang out with our friends. Like, we could sit together at lunch and stuff.

But, there are also some cons to extending the school day. For one, it would be really hard to get up early if we had to be at school for six hours. Like, I know some people don't like getting up early, and if we had to be at school for longer, it would be even harder. Plus, some people might not be able to do after-school stuff like sports and clubs if they have to be at school for longer. And, think about it, if we went to school for six hours, we would probably be super tired and grumpy. Like, who wants to be grumpy all day?

So, in conclusion, I think extending the school day could be good, but it could also be bad. It's like, it could give us more time to learn and hang out with our friends, but it could also be super hard and make us grumpy. So, I don't know if I would want to extend the school day. I think it's pretty good the way it is. But, I guess it's worth thinking about.

E3D9EE7C68F1," Have you ever wondered how many enjoyable activities are available outside of the world? There are thousands of them out there waiting to be discovered. Whether you prefer spending time with your family or going solo, there are countless ways to have fun and unwind. In this essay, we will explore three reasons why it's important to step outside of your comfort zone and try new things.

The first reason why you should step outside of your comfort zone is to try something new. Whether it's going to a new restaurant or trying a new sport, stepping outside of your comfort zone can be a great way to challenge yourself and discover new interests. For example, if you've never tried rock climbing before, why not give it a try? Not only is it a great workout, but it's also a fun and exciting way to challenge yourself and push your limits.

The second reason why you should step outside of your comfort zone is to try something you've never done before. Whether it's going to a new city or trying a new type of food, stepping outside of your comfort zone can be a great way to broaden your horizons and expand your knowledge. For example, if you've never been to Paris before, why not plan a trip and experience all that the city has to offer? From the Eiffel Tower to the Louvre Museum, there's something for everyone in Paris.

The third reason why you should step outside of your comfort zone is to try something that you've always wanted to do. Whether it's skydiving or scuba diving, stepping outside of your comfort zone can be a great way to fulfill a lifelong dream. For example, if you've always wanted to go skydiving, why not book a jump and experience the rush of freefall? Not only is it a thrilling experience, but it's also a great way to challenge yourself and push your limits.

In conclusion, stepping outside of your comfort zone can be a great way to challenge yourself, broaden your horizons, and discover new interests. Whether you're trying something new, something you've never done before, or something you've always wanted to do, stepping outside of your comfort zone can be a great way to have fun and unwind. So why not take a chance and try something new today?",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

This will make life easier on us as humans.

Cars that are programmed with computers and sensors will more than likely react faster than our human brains can.

This will lead to a great decrease in the number of car wrecks and fatalities involving cars.

Paragraph 7 says that in 2013 there was a BMW made that can steer, accelerate, and brake without a driver.

Technology is becoming more and more advanced everyday, and we should be optimistic and not shy away from this new innovation of vehicles.

F38E063ED945,"As an 8th grader, I have often found myself in situations where I have to choose between following the beliefs and opinions of others and staying true to myself. It can be challenging to navigate these conflicts, especially when it comes to issues that are deeply personal or important to me. For instance, my friends may have a certain view on a particular social issue, but I may have a different perspective that I feel strongly about. In situations like these, it can be tempting to conform to the opinions of others in order to avoid conflict or fit in, but I have learned that it is important to stand up for what I believe in, even if it means going against the crowd.

Discrimination can be a major obstacle to staying true to oneself, as it can make a person feel marginalized, excluded, or oppressed. When I encounter discrimination, I try to remember that it is not a reflection of my worth as a person, and that I deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. I also try to educate myself and others about the issues surrounding discrimination, and to advocate for change.

Remaining true to oneself can be both positive and negative. On the one hand, it can lead to a sense of authenticity and fulfillment, as I am able to live my life in a way that aligns with my values and beliefs. On the other hand, it can also lead to challenges and difficulties, such as facing criticism or rejection from others. However, I believe that the benefits of staying true to oneself far outweigh the drawbacks. When I am true to myself, I am able to live a life that is authentic and meaningful, and to pursue my dreams and goals without fear of judgment or criticism.

To remain resilient during difficult or challenging times while maintaining my individual identity, I try to focus on my strengths and the things that make me unique. I also try to surround myself with supportive and understanding people who accept me for who I am, and who encourage me to be myself. Finally, I try to practice self-care and self-compassion, and to take time for myself when I need it.

Many things could be the cause of the face on Mars, but I'm sure it's not aliens. Scientist have not proven that aliens are even real yet. If aliens were real scientist would know about it, and they might try to capture one. The face would of been causes by wind, the spacecraft, or it could of been a natural landform.

The face on Mars could have been caused by the wind. When planets rotate it could have cause some wind, and the wind could start to form piles of dirt. The dirt could have been moved into the shape of a face. The shadows give it an illusion of eye, nose, and mouth. The face didn't have any footprints around it so aliens couldn't done it. On Earth the wind blows, and pollen from one flower goes to another. Dirt on Mars could of blew to one area, and it could form a face.

Spacecrafts flying around Mars could have cause the face to appear. The air that is blowing out of the spacecraft could of blown the dirt into piles. Piles of dirts can form since the scapecraft is big. When the scapecraft takes off it could form the face because when air is blown out it leaves a mark. A spacecraft couldn't have left a mark by the face. The fuel on the spacecraft could of left a mark after blasting off Mars.

The face on Mars could be there naturally. It is the third planet from the sun. If there's any volcanoes; lava can explode out of it.

F3E2F311D829," It's not uncommon for people to rely on others to make decisions for them, whether it's because they fear hurting someone's feelings or because they believe they need someone to validate their choices. However, this approach can be limiting and can lead to missed opportunities.

One of the main reasons why people rely on others to make decisions for them is because they fear hurting someone's feelings. They may worry that their choices will cause someone else pain or disappointment, so they choose to avoid making decisions altogether. For example, when a person is trying to decide whether to leave a relationship, they may be hesitant to make a decision because they don't want to hurt the other person's feelings.

However, this approach can be limiting because it doesn't allow the person to truly consider their own needs and desires. They may end up making a decision that is not in their best interest, simply because they don't want to hurt someone else's feelings.

Another reason why people rely on others to make decisions for them is because they believe they need someone to validate their choices. They may seek out the approval of others before making a decision, because they want to ensure that their choices are ""good"" or ""right."" For example, a person may ask a friend for advice before deciding whether to start a new job, because they want to make sure that their friend thinks the job is a good fit for them.

However, this approach can be limiting because it doesn't allow the person to truly trust their own instincts. They may end up making a decision that is not in their best interest, simply because they were seeking validation from someone else.

Instead of relying on others to make decisions for them, people should strive to be more self-aware and responsible. They should take the time to consider their own needs and desires, and make decisions based on what is best for them. They should also be willing to take risks and make mistakes, knowing that they can learn from those experiences.

In conclusion, people should not rely on others to make decisions for them. They should strive to be more self-aware and responsible, and make decisions based on what is best for them. By doing so, they can avoid missing opportunities and make the most of their lives.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

This extra free time could result in increased academic performance, improved mental wellbeing, and a more well-rounded student body.

1FCDF92955B7,"Phones and Driving: Credit Recovery Essay

Accidents can be the result of anything from being drunk to being a little tired. Yes, even being too tired behind the wheel can cause an accident. While there are an infinite numbers of ways accidents can be caused, but there is one way that is currently growing in popularity. That way is cell phone use while driving. Cell phones are already known as a possible distraction in most situations, but they have a great impact on the focus of anyone, and if not taken seriously it could have unwanted results. This is a very likely result no matter if they're an experienced driver or someone who is just beginning. The most common ways such accidents happen is by drivers trying to text, make phone calls, or use other applications on their phone while on the road. However, this problem could be solved very easily if drivers today used their smartphones blue tooth ability when possible, and otherwise refrain from using their phones. Cellphones should not be being used while anyone is on the road and driving no matter what

The issue of irresponsible driving by using a cell phone is more common than news stories today make it out to be. In the past it was more thoroughly addressed when cellphones first came out and the issue was new, but now people expect it and have lost any urgency to stop people from using their phones. Many people now think its ok. This is one of the worst things that could happen because the recurrence of these accidents is only grown from then. There are statistics that compare the accident cause rates from then and now. In 2013, a total of 1.2 million crashes occurred, and 341,000 involved text messages. Then in the first six months of 2018 alone a total of 18,770 deaths were recorded from texting and driving accidents. This makes it very clear of how serious this issue can become. No matter how much safer cars get, people must be as alert and focused as they would have to be if they were in the most dangerous car because anything could happen.

Most sources, when tackling this issue add the detail that this is just or mainly teenagers that use their phones while driving. This is assumed because of how often teenagers are on their phones a day, but adults use their phones just as often. Of course, extra caution is needed when teenagers drive, but the exclusion of anyone who is not a teenager leaves the possibility of accidents from this to occur just as often. This allows any reckless adult to assume that they are skilled enough when it comes to using their phone while driving. Further research shows that this can and does happen to people of all ages and driving experience.

This way of thinking brings about greater risk for severe accidents. As well as the wrong influence on teens that are learning and planning to drive. If people don't take the initiative to make sure them and their loved ones are being safe on the road, then anything that the government does will have no effect.

Although they're not as effective as hoped, many stats in the United States have established laws that will fine anyone who is seen using their cell phone and driving. Texting and driving is very much illegal today, but there is still a lot of accidents that occur. Most importantly, laws like this have little to no effect on whether the person fined will try and or do it again in the future. The government is taking more precaution for our safety. So why has it proven to be so difficult to take responsibility of our own safety.

The simple fact is that texting and driving is problem that should not exist. There are so many ways such accidents could have been prevented. Such as a using Bluetooth device, having the passenger text for you, and of course, just flat out not using a phone while driving at all. In addition to just those few ways there is a growing number of preventatives as technology progresses. With that being said, the first step is taking self-responsibility, and it starts with each specific individual.            ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
2FF01AA49B76,"Schools requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break isn't a bad idea, but should the projects assigned be teacher-designed or student-designed? I personally, as a student would much rather prefer a student-designed project over a teacher-designed project. A lot of benefits come from letting students design their own projects. The continuation of students learning during their break is in fact important, however, students should be given the option to design their own projects that they will enjoy constructing during their brake. Students including my self don't always tend to understand instructions given to us by a teacher, so, who would students go to if they were ever confused about a certain task that had to be done on the projects designed by their teachers?

Students designing their own summer projects benefits students, teachers, and schools. As students are designing their projects, teachers have now saved time. Teachers no longer have to take time out of their day to plan these projects for their students over the summer. Students are gaining knowledge by practicing their creativity, planning and organization. While students are constructing these projects they're always learning something new whether it's from the research the student did or the materials used, the point is, students are benefiting from these projects as well. Schools now have teachers with more time to make the school a better place by being prepared for when the students come back from break and they now have smarter and brighter students who've been learning new things over the summer.

Yes, It's true, a student would much rather prefer not doing ANY projects over the summer, but if they were given the option to do a project of their choice that they design, they will complete it and they would enjoy doing it. No one wants to have a boring summer break and if students are assigned projects they should be at least able to design there own so they can have fun completing them. You'd be surprise about how creative students can get and that's what makes it fun for students. Students have a variety of choices to design a project, like online projects, poster board projects, try fold projects, etc. Learning and having fun at the same time during their summer break doesn't sound too bad after all.

Who or where would a student go to if they had a question about one of their projects that was assigned and designed by their teachers? Yes, now a days we have technology that helps us communicate, but not all students can purchase a device or their parents/guardians can't afford to purchase their children an electronic device. A student designed project would prevent all of those problems. It saves busy parents' time from having to drive their children to the school to ask questions about the projects they were assigned over the summer. With a student-designed project students would be able to put all their ideas on their projects with out having any questions because they designed it.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
2F92C7B52712,"Once school is over summer vacation starts, but not everyone is free from the work they have to do for school. Some schools believe that it is important to assign summer projects so our minds are ready for the next year. But I believe it's unfair for teachers to decide what our project is about. That's why I believe that summer projects should be created by the student and not the teacher because the student should love what their topic is about and it would give the student a sense of pride and confidence to know they can accomplish a solo project. But I also think that the teacher-designed project would be more organized.

The first reason I chose is that the student should be passionate about the topic. I believe that if a student has to do a project they don't like then the project won't be good. If you are a high school student who enjoys driving/fixing cars, and your teacher gives you a summer project about cars, you would probably feel really confident about it and start right away. But most likely, your teacher is going to give you a project on

How To Kill a Mockingbird and your going to feel really stressed and/or nervous. I remember once in my life, one of my coaches told me that ""If your mind is not ready to lead, then your body won't follow."" Even thought he was probably talking about executing the physical and mental tolls of playing a sport, it fits right in with what i'm talking about. If a student is not passionate or doesn't love their project, then there's not really a source of motivation that's making them do it. This could lead to weeks and even months of felling stressed, nervous, feeling uncomfortable with the subject, and even procrastination. This could also lead the student to believing that they are stupid or unfit to continue in advanced level classes, which I know that no teacher wants that to happen to any of their students.

The second reason I chose is that it would make the student really proud of themselves if they knew that they could create, produce, and execute a project all by themselves. I believe that if a person has full artistic control over a project, then they will be happy with their product and satisfied with their effort. It's the same feeling when a woodworker makes a table, or a home cook makes a cake from scratch. You can buy any of theses items at a store, but it's the feeling that you have the power to make it with your hands and your imagination and that's exactly how I want the students to feel. When I was 10th grade, every single tenth grader had to complete a project called the MYP (Mid-Year Personal Project). Many of the upper class men called it one of the hardest projects you'll ever do in high schools, and many of them said they didn't pass it, so I was very nervous. Even though it wasn't a summer project it still nearly six months to complete, but when I was done I was very happy with the work I did. When I was done I was also happy with the score I received, but the only reason I got that score was because the teacher allowed us to pick a topic you were either interested/passionate about and the topic I picked was coins. This also ties back into my previous talking point. If a student completes a project that they created, then they will get a sense of pride. This could lead to a boost in confidence, an increase of knowledge, and a stronger work ethic. This could also be enough to persuade them that their smart enough to compete with the other kids.

The third reason I picked, however, was that teachers have a better ability to organize a project. Even with all the proof I have given above, teachers still have a knowledgeable advantage over students. If a student starts a project and the first thing they do is research, they can be overwhelmed with all the information they received and not know how to organize it. Plus, if you think about all the ways you can choose to display your information it can get confusing. But when teachers give you a project, they most likely have everything already set for you so you can do your project. This includes what the bases of the projects about, how you have to display your project, what cites you can/can't use, and they'll even give you a rubric so you can compare what you have to what score you might get. You also can't forget how much time, money, and effort teachers have put into getting a degree in their field, so they know what their talking about.

Based on the information that I have just explained above are why students should create their own summer project. The reasons are that a student should love the topic that their researching and completing their own project would give student the sense of accomplishment that they can do bigger things. But we also have to think about how teachers are very thorough when it comes to assignments and they probably have everything planned out.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
73F2515B5BCE," I strongly disagree with the school board's decision to extend the school day by an additional hour and a half.

Firstly, students will not have enough time to sleep with the increased school day and homework. With the additional time, students will have to allocate more hours to finish their homework, which will take away from their sleep time. This can lead to a range of negative consequences, including decreased academic performance, increased stress, and even health issues.

Secondly, students will have less free time to engage in activities that they enjoy. This can include spending time with friends, playing sports, or pursuing hobbies. These activities are essential for a balanced and fulfilling life, and reducing the amount of free time students have can have a negative impact on their mental and emotional well-being.

Thirdly, students will have less time to spend with their families. Families play a crucial role in a student's life, providing emotional support, guidance, and a sense of belonging. By extending the school day, students will have less time to spend with their families, which can lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection.

In conclusion, extending the school day by an additional hour and a half is not a viable solution. It will have negative consequences on students' academic performance, mental and emotional well-being, and their relationships with their families. Instead, the school board should consider alternative solutions that prioritize the needs of students and provide them with the support they need to succeed.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

I also think that you should be a able to be in any activities or sports with a C grade average. the other reason I think that you should participate with a C grade average is because you or not failing. and the reason I said a D grade average is because that's when you're failing you're classes. and i think mostly students in this town are a C grade average and most of them are really good at sports. so if the coaches wants his team better his not going to have many good players because many students are a C grade average. so I think if students want to be in any sports or activities they need to have a C grade average for all of there classes. And I also think that it would be easier for the students to get a C grade average.,0,persuade_corpus,,8
DE373C9B8C4B,"Dear Principle,

I don't believe that removing students right to have cell phones is a smart thing to do. Although it may stop students from being distracted at school, it only stops them in that small way. There are still many other distractions that teachers need to worry about more. Students should be able to use cell phones during there free time, and just turn it off during class. It doesn't distract anyone, it allows students to socialize better, and it allows students to contact important people, such as there parents.

If students only use cell phones during lunch, after school, or at other free times, it won't be a distraction. Its about the same thing as not having a cell phone at school at all, except that they can use something they want to use when its an appropriate time. As long as they are not using there phones in class. Some of you may say that even though students aren't ""allowed"" to use them in class, some will still sneak a text or two. That if you get rid of cell phones completely at school, you won't have this problem anymore. Wrong. If you consider the fact of kids still using the phones in class, who's not to say that they won't still bring them to school anyways? Plus, cell phones aren't the biggest distraction in the world. Friends are more of a distraction. It's as if you took away their right to have friends.

With a cell phone, students have the ability to contact their friends more, and maybe they can get more friends too. Everyone knows that the more friends you have the happier your life is. They can contact old friends too, to keep in touch. Friends aren't the only thing they can contact though.

Most importantly, it allows children to contact people for important things, like their parents. With a cell phone, students can talk with their parents or guardian when something important comes up. What if a student finds out there's a basketball game after school that they want to watch? If they can't contact their parents, they can't go to the game, because their guardian would worry about them. If their parents need to contact them about something important, they can just call your cell phone. Cell phones give kids better and more continent contact.

In the end, it's better to just let kids have their cell phones. If they don't use it in class, it doesn't distract their and others education. It allows them to contact friends, and most importantly family, especially when something important happens. Why would you want to get rid of that?

Sincerely,

2875CE3A8253,"The Electoral College vote is a somewhat a confusing process with the voter not voting for the president, but electors who elect the president. Many people think that this method is flawed becuase the people are not electing the president. On the hand people think that the Electoral vote keeps the race for presidency with a more clear outcome, than if they were elected by the popular vote. There are defiently two different arguments to this points with both sides involving good evidence.

There are many flaws that people bring up in regard to the electoral vote. One of these is that since the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, the electors could easily defy the will of the people. The most obvious fact about the electoral vote is that you are not voting for the president, but for a group of electors who then vote for the president. This is also unfair to voters because the candidates don't spend time in states they know will not win. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not even see the candidates, and people in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. In turn the elctoral college is unfair and outdated.

Though there are plently of things wrong with the electoral college there are still plently of good arguments as to why we should keep it.  With the electoral college vote there is less of a chance of a dispute over the outcome thaan with the popular vote, though it happened in the 2000 election. The electoral can also make the race more fair, because a candidate with more regional appeal can not gain more electoral votes by campaigning heavily in that area. The electoral college also can help avoid run-off elections like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992. Overally the Electoral College vote is a way of electing a president without actually electing a president, that should probabley be removed so the people have more of a say on who runs there country.                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
6B648AFC9FCF,"Feelings and emotions are ways we show people how we act and what we are feeling at that moment. Only we know what we are feeling at times or even at that moment. Our emotions determine who we are and what we show from the expressions from our face. Its hard to determine what a person is thinking and what they are feeling at any moment of time. I think it is time though because someone has found a way to determine someone's emotions.

Finally someone has found a way to determine someone's feelings and emtions with a simple computer program. The person who worked and worked to show us this is Dr. Huang from Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans to communicate with computers. This idea for trying to communicate with computers brought up the idea of the feelings and emotions of a human being. They use simple calculations of the facial movements that are used to determine your feelings and emotions.

They begin the process with a 3-D process of the face and control every muscle on the face to mimic the emotions and feelings of a human being and that is amzing. The movements of the face is called a ""action unit"". Dr. huang relies on a psychologist to determine the emotions of that scan and to give six emotions that will determine every humans feelings within those six basic emotions. I think that these basic emotins are basically all the emotions any human uses for every day life. Thats why Dr. Paul Eckman picked them because them are the most common and most used emotions ever.

In paragraph three is the way humans move their muscles on their face to show emotions. Facial expressions are the one way humans can determine how someone is doing or feeling at that moment of time. In paragraph four they talk about how the program can even show that facial expressions of how Mona Lisa was feeling or what emotions she had of the time of the painting. The fact that we perform the same impressive calculation of determining a person's feelings just by looking at them is a perfect way for them to study and perfect the programs way to scanning emotions. The demonstractions of each scan are amazing at showing what the program and the computer can really do at a time where technology is at it's prime.

I feel like the computer and the humans who are trying to communicate with them are a great way to show feelings and emotions through talking. This program is gonna change the world of technology and the world of emotions for the better of the country and it's people. I think that what they are doing is a very constructive way of showing that you can find ways to determine a person's well being and their happiness. This program should be kept going at it's fullest for lots of years and should get to a point where it even helps out the crime system. As a last thought the program has to perfect this to get to maximum use of what should be used to help determine these feelins and emotions for the better.                      ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
falcon_180b_v1_426,"I believe that people should adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet because it is better for the environment and can improve our health. There are many reasons why reducing meat consumption is important.

Firstly, producing meat requires a lot of resources such as water, land, and energy. According to research, it takes about 1,800 gallons of water to produce just one pound of beef. This means that the meat industry is a major contributor to water scarcity, especially in areas where water is already scarce. Additionally, the land used for grazing and growing feed for livestock could be used for other purposes, such as growing crops for human consumption or preserving natural habitats.

Secondly, eating too much meat has been linked to various health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. A diet high in red and processed meats has been shown to increase the risk of these diseases, while a plant-based diet can help reduce the risk. Vegetarian and vegan diets are also typically lower in saturated fat and cholesterol, which can further improve heart health.

Lastly, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can also help reduce animal cruelty. Many animals are raised in cramped and unsanitary conditions, and are often subjected to cruel practices such as debeaking, castration, and tail docking. By reducing our consumption of animal products, we can help reduce the demand for these practices.

While some may argue that meat is an important source of protein and other nutrients, there are plenty of plant-based sources of these nutrients. For example, legumes, nuts, and seeds are all good sources of protein. Additionally, a well-planned vegetarian or vegan diet can provide all the necessary nutrients for a healthy lifestyle.

In conclusion, reducing meat consumption is important for the environment, our health, and animal welfare. By adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, we can help reduce our impact on the planet and improve our own health.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"There is a growing movement advocating for the reduction of meat consumption due to environmental and health concerns.

4BF07DAD296D,"Should students design their own summer projects? Can they design better projects than the teachers? While students may be aware of their own weaknesses and design projects to help themselves learn, students may often get stuck during certain parts of the project. These situations would become a disadvantage to the students due to their lack of prior knowledge about making projects to maximize learning. On the other hand, these situations would become advantages to students if teachers designed the project and were able to help the students to minimize time spent being stuck on certain parts of the project. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have sufficient experience with students in order to select the conditions for the project that are needed to help students learn during the summer, they would have sufficient knowledge about the project in order to quickly respond to student questions during the summer, and they can communicate with students and provide feedback in order to help students take maximum advantage of the summer project to learn.

Teachers have experience with students that would help them set conditons for the projects that would be beneficial for students to learn during the summer. For example, if students were required to report on historical events as part of a summer project and the teachers were aware that the students did not have enough experience finding credible sources, teachers would be able to provide a set of credible sources, such as textbooks and websites, that the students could use for their project. In this situation, teachers would be able to eliminate the need for students to find credible sources and students would be able to spend more time learning about the historical event they were reporting about. Teachers should design summer projects for students because they have the experience with students in order to anticipate and remove tasks that are irrelevant or detrimental to the learning of the students.

Teachers will be able to quickly answer questions related to the summer project, so that students minimize the time they spend being stuck on a certain part of the project. For example, if students were required to experiment on plants as part of a summer project, students could ask teachers about making the hypothesis or about conditions which the experiment should follow in order to achieve ideal results. In this situation, because the teachers designed the project, they would be able to anticipate these questions and provide the appropriate answers in order for students to complete the project. Teachers should be responsible for designing summer projects for students because they would have a better understanding of the project, and they would be able to quickly provide appropriate answers to student questions.

Teachers will be able to communicate with students more efficiently and provide meaningful feedback in order to help students take maximum advantage of the learning time during summer break. For example, if students were required to write an essay about a major theme in Romeo and Juliet, by William Shakespeare, students could share their thesis statements with their teachers, and the teachers would be able to provide references to different part of the novel for students to improve their thesis statements. In this situation, communication between students and teachers will enable the students to learn more about the novel by incorparating more parts of the novel into their essays. Teachers should design summer projects because they would be able to communicate effectively with students and provide feedback that allows students to spend more time improving their projects.

It is necessary for teachers to design summer projects because set conditions that allow students to continue learning during the summer, they can provide better answers to student questions, and they can provide meaningful feedback to students. Teachers are crucial to the design of summer projects because of the skills and experience that they bring when designing projects to help students learn during the summer. Therefore, teachers should be required to design summer projects instead of students, which will improve student learning.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
FB5189EE173C,"Dear Senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME. It would be beneficial to keep the electorial college because it is in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congree and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, if we used just popular vote candidtates would just go to bigger states like Florida, California, Texas, and Georgia and win the popular vote, and lastely without the electorial college there would be a greater chance of a dispute.

Five reasons to keep the electiorial college are:

1. Certainty of Outcome

A dispute over the outcome of an Electorial College vote is possible but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote because the winning candidate's share of the Electorial College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Almost all states award electorial votes on a winner take all bases.

This means that if a president wins 51 percent of a states popular vote they win 100 percent of the Electorial votes.

In the 2012 election Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electorial vote, but only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.

Althought a tie in the electorial vote is possible because there is an even 538 votes it is highly unlikely.

2. Everyone's President

The Electorial College requires a presidential candidater to have a trans-regianal appeal, what this means is that no regian has enough electorial votes to elect a president.

Therefore a president with only one regional appeal is unlikely to be succesful.

If the president could win the electorial vote with just one regions votes the other regians would feel disenfranchised and feel that the president wouldn't care about what they want or need.

3. Swing States

The winner-take-akk method of awarding electorial votes makes candidates focus on states called swing states.

These voters in the swing states are most likely to bve the most thoughtful voters and they are the ones that decide most elections.

An example of a swing state is Florida.

Florida always changes between Republican and Democrat and having 29 electoirial votes that is a big deal.

4. Big States

The electorial College gives back some of the weight in big states that they lose in the senate where every state has only 2 representatives.

Florida is also a big state having 29 electorial votes.

This makes Florida even more attractive to candidates to visit because it is both a swing state and a big state.

5. Avoid Run-Off Elections

The Electorial College avoids a problem in which no candidate receives a majority of the vots cast.

The Electorial College takes away that complication by providing a clear winner.

Lastley if popular vote was used candidates wouldn't have to go to a variety of states, they could go to the same big states including California, Florida, Texas, Georgia, and Washington.

Just winning the majority of these states they could win the whole election.

This would cause smaller states like Ohia, North and South Dakota, and Michigan to not be a piece of the election as much because of their low population.

I hope this helps you decide what to do about the decision between Electorial College and Popular Vote.

Think about the smaller states.

They don't want to be left out.

Thanks,

C8CFF17BCD6A,"In recent years, the decision to take four years of high school as opposed to three has become increasingly important for high school students. Going beyond the traditional three-year track in high school can open up a world of possibilities for students. Besides core academic courses and electives, a four-year high school can offer students classes in advanced math, science, foreign language, computer science, and physical education. Furthermore, the extra year of high school education provides the opportunity to develop skills important for college readiness, such as public speaking, critical thinking, and problem-solving. 

In contrast, students who opt for the three-year plan put a great deal of pressure on themselves to complete their high school education more quickly. Although this may save students an extra year in tuition fees, it also causes them to miss out on the same courses that other students would gain from the fourth year. Moreover, students may face the challenge of having to fit a full year's worth of coursework into a three-year period, resulting in an increased workload and potential burnout. 

Ultimately, deciding whether to pursue a three-year or four-year track in high school can be a challenging decision that affects a student's academic and professional future. With that in mind, it is important to weigh the pros and cons of both options before making the right choice.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

I don't agree to this policy change because not all students can be able to get a B or A on the report card. Sports is the only thing that we thing is fun from school. Is the thing that keep us from going back home early, take care of our annoying siblings or even going to a little kids party with the family. Their also the reason that a lot of students have their grades up and there's not that much fighting. Something important that they care about is their appearance to be honest, if theirs no cute football players nobody besides their family will attend, because girls don't want to see some ugly guy to be the quarter back that is representing us and our school.

Oh and there's another point sports represent our school, you don't want some wimps as the football players, because they will probably loose all the games and the school will be known as the wimpiest school in the whole district and I know me or any other students will want that at all, because if that happens like I said there will be fighting, really bad grades from the majority of all the students and the teachers will have to deal with us another whole hour teaching us something we should already know. Another thing that goes with that is that all the effort we have put in all these years will disappear and never come back, and sorry if I sound really disrespectful but is all true nothing of this is a lie.

Now if you are going to take out all the other curriculum activities just for us to have a B well your high level classes will be almost empty, because in my pre-ap math class all the students have a high C and even a low B but that is all.

51D70845DFA5,"COMMUNITY SERVICE

Dear Principal,

I think all students should perform community service because no one wants to live in a place where there is trash everywhere. I think people should do community service because they are part of the problem and not the solution. I say that because teenagers are the ones that are throwing trash anywhere and not care what the world look like. Lets say i was in the car with my mom and i just finished eating a candy bar. What do i do? I throw it out the window. That right there was pollution to our world. I'm not saying i do that it was just an example of what kids do today. I also not saying that adults don't do it because some of them do just what us teenagers do. Our world is dying because of all this pollution. If people just clean up the trash outside like they clean they house, or they stop throwing trash on the ground our world wouldn't be so polluted. So kids are clean up outside, but when they come back what do they see? They see more paper, candy bag. tissue. shoes, and etc. outside. That's why a lot of people don't like to clean up because when they leave and come back they see a lot of things back on the ground where they just cleaned up at. I think if people start caring more about the world and stop caring about the little things in they like our world wouldn't be so polluted. So i think if people star making a change it would really help. Even if they just pick up a couple pieces of paper. That would help a lot. I think if there was a cleaning group that would also help. I think that, because today a lot of teenagers follow what are people do. Some teenagers don't have their own minds so they follow what someone else do even if it is the wrong thing to do. I think helping the community is very important also because even the littlest things can change someone and the world. I think if us young people just toke the time to just to help the world a lot us young people wouldn't be died, on the streets, or killing each other. We would be in school learning and helping the community. Like working at soup kitchens, helping an old person across the street, or even just clean up the park. A lot of people don't do these things because when they tell their friends about it and tell them they should come. The friends tell them that is a stupid idea and why should they do that when they can go the movies or something. That stop a lot of kids from doing what they wanted because they listen to what they friends think and don't want to get laughed at. That is why i think people need to stop listening to what they friends have to say and do what they wanted to do in the first place. That is why i think kids should do community service.

Why, because anything could happen when a car is just being completely controlled by technology. Anything can have malfunctions, wether it's proved to have them or not.

For example, in the 7th paragraph, it states: ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" Meaning you would still have to have a human taking percautions at all times. Another thing I don't like, is how the cars alert the driver when it comes to traffic complications, because in paragraph 7 it also states: ""They can't navigate their way out of traffic jams, roadworks or accidents."" What if the car goes into a freak out mode and ends up having a mind of its own, because it won't know what to do, and starts driving automatically? Also, what if you get into a horrible car accident injuring yourself and many other people? Who would be put to blame here if the car is completely driverless?

These problems and questions I have with the ""driverless cars"" need to be taken very seriously into consideration.

8C215301594E,"I believe that summer projects should be designed by teacher's. Summer projects are meant to keep students minds engaged so that when school starts back up again in the fall, they are ready to hit the ground running. Studies show that 76% of students who have summer projects get 22% higher test scores in the first quarter. Parents who have shared their input with schools about summer projects also say that their children seem more engaged for the entire summer. Parents who have children that don't receive summer assignments have said that their children lay around and do nothing all summer. Teachers should design summer projects because they know what is going to be taught in the upcoming year, and they know how challenging to make summer assignments in order to keep students engaged all summer long.

Teacher's start making their lesson plans before their school year even starts in order to be prepared for he upcoming year. If teacher's are preparing for school to start up again in the summer then why shouldn't students be preparing for school during the summer? When students don't come prepared on the first day if school, it sets off a bad tone for the rest of the school year. When students aren't prepared to start learning then they start off behind everyone else who did come prepared. Summer assignments keep students minds in shape over the summer so that they are prepared to start learning on the first day of school. Teachers should make these summer assignments because they know what is going to be taught in the upcoming year, therefore they know what the students should be working on over the summer in order to give them a head start for the whole school year.

A lot of teacher's have started teaching right when school starts, especially in high school. Because of this, students who don't show up prepared to learn right away start the entire year off on the wrong foot and sometimes it's hard to ever get back on track. So to combat this, teachers assign summer projects that are challenging enough so that students still have to work to complete the assignment but not so difficult that it's impossible. Teachers should design the summer assignments because they know how challenging to make the summer assignments. Students who aren't challenged at least a little over the summer also come to school unprepared to hit the ground running. So in order for students to be properly prepared to start learning on the first day of school, teachers should design the summer project.

Some people may disagree and say that students should be able to design their own lesson plan because hey know how difficult their assignments should be. If students were to make their own summer assignments they wouldn't be prepared o start learning right away. A lot of students would make their assignment so easy that they could finish it in 10 minutes while others would make it so difficult that it would be impossible to finish. Teachers would know how hard to make a summer assignment based on how the student performed in the previous year and what they need to be prepared for in the upcoming year.

Teachers should be the people to design summer projects for students because they know what the students will be learning in the upcoming year and they know what the students have already learned. Summer assignments are meant to keeps students minds in shape s that they are ready to start learning on the first day of school. When students make their own summer assignments, they tend to be ill-prepared to start learning immediately. Teachers know what's best for their students so teachers should make the summer assignments.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

727F83C82B08,"Do you ever wonder why people may seek multiple opinions on something? having multiple opinions could benefit you in many ways. Maybe you dont know very much about a topic but a friend does. Or maybe you just ask multiple people to reassure yourself. some people might also give you bad advice on purpose. Thats why seeking multiple opinions could lead to better advice, help you make better choices for yourself, and give you a more educational answer.

One way having multiple opinions can help you is by receiving better advice. For example, a friend gives you advice and you are not sure so you go and ask someone who knows more about the topic. Or maybe when you're doing an group assignment for school and you nor your group knows the answer to a problem so you decide to ask a peer that understands it more. One last way is that not everyone wants the best for you so people may give you bad advice on purpose. Thats why having multiple opinions can help you receive better advice.

Multiple opinions could help you make a better choice as well. There is always going to be people in your life that don't want the best for you and they might persuade you do do stupid things. So having at least one close person to go to so you can talk about your problems can help you make better choices for yourself. For example, your friends are going somewhere or doing something that you don't feel comfortable doing but they are pressuring you to go and telling you its a good idea. Thats why having multiple opinions could help you make better choices for yourself.

Last but not least multiple choices could help you receive a more educational answer. You cannot expect people to know everything but you can try and receive the most educational answer possible. For example, taking advice from only one person all the time isn't going to help you very much if they don't know a lot about the subject. A good friend is someone that you can relate too. Because if you have friends you cannot relate to then talking to them about problems basically useless because they will never know how to help. Thats why multiple opinions can lead to a more educational answer.

In conclusion, having multiple opinions on situations can benefit you you in many ways. So i believe that having multiple people to talk to isn't a bad thing, but you should always have one close person that understands you the most. Having people in your life that don't give good advice won't help you in the long run as well. You want to have multiple people to go to so you can figure out the best solution. All of these are reasons why having multiple opinions can give you better advice to reassure yourself, help you make better choices when you might not know what to do, and give you a more educational answer on a topic that someone doesnt know much about.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

13EBA3BE41C2,"Have you heard of the photo taken in 2001 that revealed a strange, unusual, ""Face on Mars?"" In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars in search for a landing spot for its sister ship. During the look for a site, the spacecraft noticed something that resembled a human face. This discovery brought up a huge debate between other NASA scientist and conspiracy theorists. The people thought that the Face was a confirmation of life on Mars, but we scientist can ensure you that the Face is just a natural landform. The picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa.

The Face on Mars was discovered on a red planet called Cydonia. When Jet Propulsion Lab seen the photographs captured by the NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, they figured that it was just another Martain mesa. Jet Propulsion Lab came to the conclusion that it was just a mesa because in the text it states, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia..."" From this the reader can infer that mesas are often found on this planet. Not only did Jet Proplusion Lab believe it was just a natural landform, Mars Global Suveyor also believed it was created naturally.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument after all. The spacecraft flew over Cydonia and also captured a picture of the pop icon, the Face on Mars,. The Mars Global Surveyor took a photograph, but ten times sharper than the original photograph from NASA's Viking photos. This picture sure proved that there were no alien monuments. However, people believed it was too cludy to see clearly. Therefore, a high-resolution image from more recent technology offically confirmed that the Face is just a mesa.

Mission controllers from Mars Global Surveyor prepared to take another look at the Face on Mars. On April 8, 2001, the spacecraft flew over Cydonia again and captured a photo as clear as day. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said,"" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" This photograph showed that the Face on Mars is equivalent to landforms found around the American West.

In conclusion, the picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa. I believe that this was an amazing discovery and gave us, NASA scientist, a challenge to go out and find evidence to prove conspiracy theorists's accustuations. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
F5B510BCCA2D,"Participating in sports and music can be extremely beneficial for individuals looking for enjoyable ways to express themselves. In this essay, I will explore the numerous advantages of engaging in these activities and how they can positively impact one's overall well-being.

Firstly, participating in sports can provide individuals with a sense of physical and mental well-being. Exercise is essential for maintaining a healthy body, and engaging in sports can help individuals achieve this while also providing a fun and enjoyable way to stay active. Furthermore, physical activity has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety, which can have a positive impact on mental health.

In addition to the physical and mental benefits, engaging in sports can also provide individuals with a sense of community and belonging. Team sports, in particular, require individuals to work together towards a common goal, which can foster a sense of camaraderie and collaboration. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals who may struggle with social interactions or feel isolated in other areas of their lives.

Another benefit of participating in sports is the development of important life skills, such as discipline, teamwork, and leadership. These skills can be applied to other areas of one's life, such as school or work, and can help individuals succeed in their personal and professional endeavors.

In addition to sports, music can also be an enjoyable way for individuals to express themselves. Participating in music can provide individuals with a creative outlet and a way to connect with others who share their interests. Furthermore, music can have a positive impact on mental health, reducing stress and anxiety and promoting relaxation and well-being.

In conclusion, participating in sports and music can provide individuals with numerous benefits, including physical and mental well-being, community and belonging, and the development of important life skills. These activities can be enjoyed by individuals of all ages and backgrounds and can provide a fun and fulfilling way to express oneself.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,5
E0B86027C5C5,"Okay, here is my essay:

Working or doing things individually can have a lot of benefits. When people work or do things by themselves, they can develop important skills that help them succeed in life. For example, when people work alone, they can learn how to be responsible and reliable. They can also learn how to problem solve and think critically. These skills are important because they can help people achieve their goals and be successful in their careers.

When people work or do things individually, they can also develop their own unique style and approach. This can help them stand out and be more creative. For example, a musician who practices alone can develop their own unique sound and style. A writer who works alone can develop their own unique voice and style. This can help them be more successful and creative in their field.

Being yourself is also important for success. When people are themselves, they can be more authentic and genuine. This can help them connect with others and build stronger relationships. For example, a person who is themselves can be more confident and comfortable in their own skin. This can help them make friends and find a supportive community.

Planning and achieving goals is also important for success. When people set goals and work towards them, they can develop a sense of purpose and direction. This can help them stay motivated and focused. For example, a person who sets a goal to run a marathon can train and prepare themselves to achieve that goal. This can help them feel a sense of accomplishment and pride.

Working or doing things individually can be different from working or doing things with a partner. When people work with a partner, they can learn how to collaborate and work together. This can help them develop teamwork and communication skills. However, working or doing things individually can also help people develop their own unique skills and approach.

In conclusion, working or doing things individually can have a lot of benefits. It can help people develop important skills, be themselves, and achieve their goals. While working with a partner can also be beneficial, there are many advantages to working or doing things individually. By doing so, people can develop their own unique style and approach, be more authentic and genuine, and achieve their goals in their own way.",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

b1cb903e,"Dear Rick Scott, Every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, the Electoral College casts their votes to elect the new President of the United States of America. These voters are chosen by the citizens of their state Florida, Texas, etc. to vote in their favor of their preferred party. For example, a Democratic voter in California will vote for Democratic Electoral College candidates to vote for their preferred President. Though many people are opposed to this method of voting, calling it an anachronism & taking away the vote from the citizens of the United States, American citizen's votes still count, the Electoral College can avoid problems popular voting could result in, and the Electoral College listens to those with the initiative and right to make a smart vote. For these reasons I would like to keep the Electoral College.

The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between election of the President by a vote of Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, meaning one vote almost relies on the other. A common misconception made by citizens is that when they vote they vote for a President, when in fact they are voting for people to vote in their favor for the President. So the more Republican Electoral College voters your state has, most likely the end vote will be the electoral votes go to the Republican candidate. Many people say that the electoral college ""takes away the votes of the citizens, and that their vote doesn't matter"" when in reality, they matter in every way possible. If the citizens do not vote, who will vote for the electoral college members? And without the citizens to decide who the members of the Electoral College will be, who will be in the Electoral College all together?

Not only do the Citizen's votes count, but the Electoral College can help solve the problems that a popular voting system could have. The Electoral College votes with the majority of the state, meaning that the party with the highest request for its Presidency, the Electoral College will cast its votes towards. Meaning a highly Democratic state can count on their state's vote to most likely be for the Democratic candidate. The Electoral College also avoids runoff elections. This means that the election will always show a clear winner for the state's vote. There is a lot of potential pressure for a runoff election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cats that pressure could greatly affect the Presidential election process, which the Electoral College reduces, ultimately showing a clear winner.

And finally, the Electoral College listens to smart and eligible voters. Very rarely does a State's Electoral College vote against the wishes of their citizens. In fact that would be the exact opposite of their job. It's also an inetible fact that not every voter is an ideal voter. Many citizens do not keep themselves up to date on the issues candidates plan to solve, occupation backgrounds, or even their personality. Many voters in fact vote on astetics, which is ultimately the most dangerous voter there is an uner educated one.

So Mr. Scott, I hope you take into account that an in terms of an electoral college, an American citizen's vote does count, they avoid the problems popular votes could create, and they do listen to their state's smart, eligable voters. If the Founding Fathers created this tool for the balance in our voting system, then balance there shall be.",0,train_essays,,3

I think the you should follow the second phones at school because they can lose their phone.

some reasons are they can lose their phone at school. its a rule at any school and any thing can happen.

you should also follow the first policy because students may need to contact their parents or if they are in any after school programs like cheerleading, basketball etc.

There are many reasons why students should and should not have their phones in school, I think they should be able to bring their phones just turn them off because there so many reason why they need their phone.

Then again they shouldn't bring their phone because they might text during class taking up the time they need so they can learn. Many principal many get many complaints about their students having their phones in school I believe they cant do any thing about it, if one of their students phone goes off they shouldn't be able to take it but if it was out in plain view then they can take it but i think at the end of that class period they should be able to get it back but the teacher have to turn it off and let them know they cant turn it back on till the end of the day when they go home.

From point of view i believe that we should be able to have are phones in case of in emergency because we never know when somebody at school gets hurt o injured if they don't have any contacts on that student because they weren't allowed to bring phones to school its really falls down on that school.

By students getting the chance to designe their own projects they can expand their creative minds. Students can get creative with their art and that could inspire others no matter how hard it might get. They could push themsleves to get out of their comfort zone and this could lead them to have bigger oppoutunties. Students getting the chance to do their own project could make them follow through with it.

By students designing their own projects they could express emotion through art and color. A project could have a deeper meaning such as: religon, expreience, or something they believe in and this could keep a student by following with the project and actually finishing it. Students getting the chance to designe their own projects could be benifical to those who suffer with depprestion. They could use art as a way to cop with what they're suffering with by expressing their emotions. It could inspire them to keep it pushing no matter what.

Benifits could come by students designing their own projects such as getting better grades. Students who don't do their work and get a faling grade could benifit from this. They could think that the way of the teacher doing the project is boring and with this they can have more freedom and show off their creativity. This could inspire studnents to do their work. Students could follow through with their project's and get good grade's by them desgning the way they prefer it. They could feel more comfrotable with doing the project by them doing it how they want to.

Students get the chance to explore new things and they can use that expreince to their benfit. By students getting the chance to try new things they could step out of their comfort zone and get the chance to explore new talents.

0D983D66364A,"Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. I personally think it's a bad idea because you won't get that much help, do stuff individual, and won't be the same as attending school.

If students wants to attend classes from home. Well I recommend not to because you wont get any help from the teachers. yes, you can call and do a video conferencing but it just wont be the same. For example, there was this one time that i was sick for a week because of the flu. So I emailed my teacher what I miss and her respond is to look it up on teams. Like how am I suppose to know what to do. And she wasn't any help at all. That's why its a bad idea to not attend at school.

Another reasaon why I think it's a bad idea to attend classes from home is that we do stuff individual. At school we have the option to work in a group with people to do our work sometimes. For example, lets say that the teacher let you work in groups. And you're in a group of four. Well some of us dont have to do everything. That's we have to do a little to cooraporate with the group. Meaning you don't have to do the work by yourself. That's why it's a bad idea to stay at home and do work by yorself.

The last reason why I think it's a bad idea is beacuse it won't be the same as attending school. You could also stay in a club or do sports. School is the best way of learning new things and socialize with people. They also havve soccer games and dances that you can go to. Plus you can get some good food from the cafeteria. That's why they should attend school.

If you ask someone to help you make a choice it can lead to you making a new friend that you can depend on when you need it the most with any situation and give you advice that will help whenever you need it and make you a better person as well.

Also, asking for help from others can making choosing much easier since they have no bias opinion on what you should do and they could choose for you on what to do instead of you making a hard choice you do not have to worry about all that given that someone helped you make choosing easier.

You could ask for an opinion from someone who has been in the same situation as you and they could tell you which choice is the best choice to make that will make everyone happy and no conflict at all.

DAE1AA29184B,"Extending the school day at Generic_School by two hours for four days a week is a topic that has been debated for years. While some people believe that this would be beneficial for students, others argue that it would have negative effects. In this essay, I will analyze the pros and cons of extending the school day and offer my opinion on the matter.

One of the main advantages of extending the school day is that it would give students more time to learn and improve their grades. With more time in the classroom, students would have the opportunity to ask more questions and receive more individualized attention from their teachers. Additionally, students would have more time to complete homework and other assignments, which could lead to higher grades and better academic performance overall.

Another benefit of extending the school day is that it could help to improve attendance rates. By providing students with more time to learn and improve, they may be more motivated to attend school regularly. This could lead to higher attendance rates and a more engaged student body.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to extending the school day. For example, some students may struggle with the increased workload and feel overwhelmed or stressed. This could lead to decreased motivation and even dropout rates. Additionally, students may have less time for extracurricular activities such as sports or clubs, which could lead to a decrease in overall student engagement and satisfaction.

In my opinion, the benefits of extending the school day outweigh the drawbacks. While some students may struggle with the increased workload, the potential for higher grades and improved attendance rates is too great to ignore. Additionally, while students may have less time for extracurricular activities, these activities can be scheduled outside of school hours or during weekends. Overall, I believe that extending the school day by two hours for four days a week would be a positive change for students at Generic_School.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,5
97A27B9801B5,"As high school students, we are often overwhelmed with the many decisions we have to make about our future. One of the most important decisions we have to make is what career we want to pursue. In this essay, I will explore the different career options available to high school students and their associated benefits. I will also discuss how career identification can help students enjoy learning and stay motivated to achieve their goals.

There are many different career paths available to high school students, and each one has its own unique benefits. Some students may choose to pursue a career in the arts, such as music, theater, or visual arts. These careers offer the opportunity to express creativity and passion for a particular field. Others may choose to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). These careers offer the opportunity to use their analytical skills and problem-solving abilities to make a difference in the world.

Career identification can be a powerful tool in helping students enjoy learning and stay motivated to achieve their goals. When students have a clear idea of what they want to do, they are more likely to be engaged and interested in their studies. This can lead to better grades, increased participation in class, and a greater sense of purpose and direction. Additionally, when students have a career commitment, they are more likely to work hard and persevere through challenges.

Having a career commitment can also lead to a successful future. Studies have shown that students who have a clear career goal are more likely to graduate from college and find meaningful employment. This is because they have a clear direction and purpose, which helps them stay focused and motivated. Additionally, having a career commitment can lead to greater job satisfaction and a greater sense of fulfillment in life.

In conclusion, career identification is an important part of the high school experience. It can help students enjoy learning and stay motivated to achieve their goals. Additionally, having a career commitment can lead to a successful future. Whether students choose a career in the arts or STEM, it is important for them to take the time to explore their options and make an informed decision about their future. By doing so, they can set themselves up for success and achieve their dreams.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0

1D828863ECB6,"I remember when I was younger, I used to think that I could solve every problem myself. I was wrong. People always think they know best, but this is seldom true. Everyone you see walking past has faced their own set of unique challenges, and consequently each person holds a knowledge that could prove beneficial to you. Seeking advice from more than one person can help someone make a better choice, because it allows the person to consider other's experiences, perspectives, and enables them to make a less biased, more sensible decision.

Listening to the experiences of others is critical when it comes to making a good choice. Ask for advice from someone who is older and wiser. Someone with additional life experience. While it may sound cliche, your elders do have valuable lessons to share. Additionally, this life experience could include bad decisions that they, themselves, have made in the past. Learning from the mistakes of those around you is a foolproof way to avoid making a poor choice yourself. Likewise, other people may have been in a similar situation before. If another person has been faced with the same decision, or one that is related to your own, that person will, certainly, be happy to tell you what worked, or did not work, for them. Taking into account the experiences of others increases the likelihood of making a choice that leads to your success.

In addition to life experience, everyone has a different perspective. These varying point of views could allow a person to see their own situation differently. Being able to look at the issue in a new light is, undoubtedly, one of the most important factors in deciding what to do. Moreover, another person might see a solution you did not think of. Putting multiple minds together makes it far easier to solve tough challenges in life. Lastly, in a way, hearing other's perspectives provides you the ability to observe your own life in the third person. Almost as if you have exited your body and can now see what everyone else is able to see. This new vision is useful in preventing you from making a choice that you will later regret. When you consult with others, you are sure to see something you did not consider beforehand.

The experiences and perspectives of other people help you to remain impartial and sensible when it comes to decision-making. In times of stress, people have a tendency to get wrapped up and consumed in their own heads. If you have someone to calm you down, you are far more likely to not make a rash, emotional decision. Furthermore, people are often biased of their own point of view. If you do not go to multiple sources, you may end up making a choice that is unfair to others, or unfair to yourself. Lastly, seeking other people's opinions gives you opportunity to effectively weigh the pros and cons of your options. Each person has something of their own to offer, and it is crucial that you hear the voices of others when making an honest choice. All in all, listening to multiple opinions on a matter allow a person to stay logical and fair when faced with a difficult choice.

All things considered, seeking advice form multiple sources is necessary if you wish to make a well-informed decision. The experiences and point of views of those around you are crucial in staying fair and not getting clouded by your own judgment. Ultimately, those three things that you can gain from listening to what other people have to say, are what is going to stop you from doing something irrational. If you refrain from asking for advice, or only ask one person, you could be missing out on obtaining information that could keep you from doing something you will regret. ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
71D831DE643E,"Technology today is beginning to support the possibility of driverless cars. However, there are many issues that would support arguments against the development of these cars. This radical idea is actually rather unrealistic, the technology required is far too advanced for any humans to develop in a safe manner. In addition, there are too many safety and law issues surrounding the automatic cars. Lastly, cars that drives themselves would be rather unbeneficial to people themselves. Development on driverless cars should not continue on farther than they already have.

Technology nowadays has advanced farther than we could have ever imagined. It's true that we have now accomplished what used to seem impossible, but how far is too far? Many of the cars that have been developed have incredible technology, but they all still require a reliable human driver. The farthest companies, such as BMW, have come are things like the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car can handle speeds only up to 25 mph, which is far below the speed limit on most roads. The cars are able to perform specific functions on their own, but are all programmed with things to make sure that the driver is fully alert since they can't handle more than slow and striaght driving on their own. The idea of completely driverless cars is unrealistic, which has been proven by the requirement that the cars need a driver to fully take them over in most situations. Too much time and too many resources are being put into an idea that may take centuries to develop, this time and resources could be put into more pressing issues.

In the states, it is illegal for driverless cars to even be tested. If they can't be tested in real life situations, then how will we ever get the chance to develop them? It's true that some states, such as California and Nevada, allow limited use of semi-automatic cars, but thats a far cry from allowing cars to completely drive themselves. The current laws are based off the fact that a safe, human driver is required to be behind the wheel. New laws would have to override current ones to allow such vehicles, which seems to be more trouble than worth. Aditionally, questions on safety play a major role in many arguments. Technology is wonderful and often helpful, but its never 100% reliable. When malfunctions occur, people will get hurt by the destructive weapon that is an automatic vehicle. Also, the question of who would be liable for the accident would arise; is it the manufacturer or driver? Many conflicts between individuals and large companies would begin to form.

Finally, driverless cars may cause more harm than good to the human mind. If the technology to have cars drive themselves is developed, then more and more things will evolve to ""improve"" human lives. In reality, this technology will likely promote extreme laziness in already unproductive beings. While behind the wheel, drivers would get bored and distracted absolutely doing nothing. Even though sensors and other technology are being developed that would quickly alert the driver when the vehicle is in need of assistance and keep them ""safely"" preoccupied, they are not full-proof. As with all technology, malfunctions would likely occur and cause accidents. Also, the driver may have a tendency to check their phone and do other distrating things if they rely too much on the technology, which would cause even more accidents. This again brings up the question of liability. Was it the driver's fault for not being alert or the manufacturer's for failing to alert them?

To conclude, the development of driverless cars should come to a halt. It is true that car technology has advanced greatly, but everything still requires a functioning human driver. This development is overshadowing more important issues of today's world. In addition, there are laws in place that prohibit driverless cars for a reason. It is nearly impossible to test out the development of these vehicles due to these laws, which should be a very obvious sign to discontinue these efforts. The largest issue is safety. Technology is not completely reliable and never will be. Especially in new developments, malfuntions and technical difficulties are very common. Things have been developed that may alert drivers and keep them from becoming bored, but they may promote bad habits. People would become increasingly lazy and become more unsafely distracted behind the wheel than ever. Don't support the development of driverless cars by making sure to be a safe, alert driver and understand how far too far is concerning the development of technology. ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
414014387A3E,"Limiting the use of automobiles would make a drastic impact on the world in many ways, such as decreasing pollution in the air; and providing citizens a healthier lifestyle.

By limiting the use of car transportation, you are decreasing the harmful gases that automobiles release into the air. In passage two, it states that Paris initiated a temporary driving ban to clear the air of the global city, known as ""The smog"". Which is a great thing, because it motivates citizens to provide new ways to get around, such as walking or riding a bike; and it provides the area with freasher air to breath. France's actions caught the attention Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world.

Another significant reason why decreasing the use of cars is a great thing, is because it allows citizens to interact with each other; and to promote alternative transportations to travel around the city. In passage 3, it states that millions of columbians, in Bogota, Coulumbia partake in a car free day, which they hope will inspire others all around to do the same. The citizens of columbia used more effiecient ways to travel around the city such as, hiking, biking, or skating. It provided them a great exercise, reduced stress and air pollution, and a chance to interact with their community and environment. Columbia's event recieved a great deal attention and widely influenced other countries and cities all over the world.

Although, automobiles provide an easier, faster way to get around it is the cause of toxic pollution in the air. So limiting car usauge will provide fellow citizens with a healthier lifestyle and freasher air. One small step to decrease pollution could spark a revolutionary change.            ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
F4EC42B28077,"Do you want to be forced to play a sport, work in the yearbook, or be in the student council? Our principal has decided that you have to do at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular means out of school so that automatically puts many roles in play. Since you cannot say no to the principal, it means you have no choice but to participate in one. Students should not have to do an extracurricular activity because their family might not have enough money to support one, there can be transportation issues, and students would have less time to complete their daily expectations.

One reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is that their family might not have enough money to financially support one. That means that you are adding to the fact that there are already money struggles. Most extracurricular activities come with some sort of cost which means adding an extracurricular activity to the bill would likely cause stress. Unless the school is willing to pay for each persons activity, the principal should not be allowed to force it upon them to complete a sport or whatever they choose. If the principal is planning on requiring at least one activity to be done per student throughout the whole school year and not just one quarter or semester, that would add even more cost that the parents have to take out of their paycheck.

Another reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because their family might not be able to take them everyday. Their guardians have to take time out of their own day to drive their kid to a place that might be a far distance from their home. It also might cause their parents to have to leave work early or hire someone to drive them, both affecting their paycheck. The students could carpool but there's a big chance that you won't know anyone doing the same activity as you. No matter what, whoever is driving you will still have to pay for gas. Since the principal is requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity they should offer transportation, but since they are not it really leaves you no choice but to figure it out on your own.

A third reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is that they will have a lot less time for their daily expectations. Students often receive homework everyday and have chores they need to complete. They also have to spend time with their family, eat dinner, and they might have plans with their friends. The activity they have to do will most likely conflict with at least one of those things. It would be a shame that their family would have to change their schedule in order for it to work out with the students' activity. The activity would most likely last longer than an hour which pulls a big chunk of time away from them being able to do their homework, chores, and eat. It could risk students falling behind in school and cause extreme stress. The students may also drift from their friends and family and their health can decline from lack of sleep and nutrition.

These are just three reasons explaining how forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity can be harmful financially, health wise, and many other ways. Being forced to do a sport or something of the sort can cause a lot of unessecary stress at such a young age. It should be a students choice if he or she wants to do an extracurricular activity, but it should not be forced.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
7B00EEFA1313," If you want to pursue a career, it is important to consider the impact it will have on your life and your family's happiness. While technology can be a valuable tool in helping you achieve your career goals, it is important to be aware of its potential drawbacks and limitations.

In my opinion, pursuing a career can be a fulfilling and rewarding experience, especially if it aligns with your passions and interests. However, it is important to approach your career with caution and consideration, as it can have a significant impact on your life and the lives of those around you.

One of the most important aspects of pursuing a career is the responsibility that comes with it. Whether you are starting a new job or pursuing a more advanced degree, it is important to take ownership of your career and make the most of the opportunities that come your way. This may involve learning new skills, networking with others in your field, and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in your industry.

Another important consideration when pursuing a career is the impact it will have on your family's happiness. While a successful career can provide financial stability and a sense of fulfillment, it can also take time and energy away from your family. It is important to find a balance between your career and your personal life, and to make sure that your family is supportive of your career goals and aspirations.

Ultimately, the decision to pursue a career is a personal one, and it is up to each individual to weigh the pros and cons and make the best decision for themselves and their families. While technology can be a valuable tool in achieving your career goals, it is important to approach your career with caution and consideration, and to make the most of the opportunities that come your way.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

D12A8B3D1C11,"Dear Principle,

We definitely should not go through with this horrific idea. Your team sports will quickly lose many athletes and will probably not have enough players to even start. Many kids do have a C average that are excellent football, basketball, soccer, tennis, or softball players. Some kids can't help their learning skills as well as others. It definitely wouldn't be fare to the kids.

If I had to guess your schools athletic programs would not be very successful, do to the loss of players to the team. you will see your teams record, stat's, and even fan base decrease because of the loss of talent and depth in your depth chart. You will soon regret this very drastic decision if this change is made.

I don't think that I am the only one who feels this way about this decision. I myself have a C average in school, and I try very hard to maintain that so I can play football and basketball. Please Sir, just think about your decision. I and the whole Student Body ask of you to not change the average.

It depend from the knowledge of a students if he/she can take everything on his/her heat. May be more time led the students to know what they want to do after the High School, and have elective classes can help the students to be a good worker in the future because they are more creative.

Depend from the knowledge of the student if he/she can take everything on his/her heat because some students have the capacity to learn a lot without forgered and other not, possibly they have apathy in some classes or they are more interested in other things since in some school districts offer progams that can contein clases that students don't want to learn. But, it can be very helpfull for the students that want to graduate so fast from the high school becuse may be they want to work without a interuption from high school's things or the want to go the colledge without they had a lot of time in high school. Also, some students think that have the capacity to graduate from high school in a short time and other prefert to graduate with the normal years because some students want to have the advanced diploma that can give you goods oprtunities.

May be more time led the students to know what they want to do after high school because some students graduated so fast that they didn't thing correcly what they want to be or what to do after the high, someway you have do to something in your life that can help you to live ecconimicaly between the world. For example, you are graduate today but in a week or a month you are doing nothing because you don't know what you want to do but you need something with your life. Also, if you want to graduate so fast from high school you need a plan like; i'll work after high school because i need money, or i want to study more because i think i need to know more and i want in my future. For example: the people who work after high school is the people that knows whar they want without matter the time that they took in the high school and the people who still stiding is because they arenot ready to know what they want or they still studing for a carrer.

Have elective classes can help the students to be a good worker in the future because they are more creative, and elective clasess led the students to learnd new things that can help them in the future and in their usually life. For example: if they take an art class they will be more creative, if they take a music art they can have their own record. Also , elective class give more oportunities that a progam that conteins the usually class and borred. Finally, summer is a good time to take a break from high school and you have the oportunity to be in a class

Online if it's difficult for you to remenber something during that time.

In conclusion, some programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years are good for the students who knows what they want to do after the high schools like if they want to work or if they will still studing. Also take a little bit time to graduate is not to bad because you never will to know what new things can you learn in the elapse of the time you keep have the oportunity to think more in what to do in the future. Also, if you have the capacity to remenber things for a log time is not too bad the idea to graduate in three years.

This could be something big, but you know it isn't alive, so you have to assume it is a landform. When you go back and show everyone what you found people think it is an alien, but further investigations show it is a natural landform. This Face is a natural landform because no one has ever seen something like this before, no one has any proof that it is a human or alien, and NASA and the Mars Global Surveyor say it is a landform.

First of all, no one has seen anything like this before. The text states,"" There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors."" This peice of evidence shows that the face is new to them, and they don't know what it is. Another piece of evidence is,"" Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars."" This, also, shows that NASA doesn't know what it is. If no one knows what it is then you can't say it is a human or alien without knowing the facts.

Secondly, no one has any proof that it could be an alien or a human. For instance, the text states,"" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa."" This piece of evidence shows that they can't figure out exactly what the face is. They are making aussumtions of what the face might be, but they aren't one-hundred percent sure of what it is.

Lastly, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet he found out the face was a natural landform. For example, the text states,"" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" This shows that once they got a clear picture of the face, the JPL found out it was just an ordinary landform. The text also states,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" This piece of evidence found in the text shows that NASA figured out that the face was a landform. Yes, the face did look like a human, but the NASA found out it was a landform when they closely examined the it.

In conclusion, the face that was thought to be an alien or a human was clearly a natural landform. First of all, it was never seen before, so no one could be sure of what it was. Secondly, people just assumed it was an alien or a human, and they had no proof that it was. Lastly, the Mars Global Surveyor found out the face was a natural landform.

Although there are still some problems with the driverless cars, I think it would be a great invention. Driverless cars could reduce car crashes, it would be less expensive, less pollution and many more great features. There are some small bugs at the moment, but anything can be fixed.

Driverless cars could help cause less accidents because of all of the sensors it would have. Google´s modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimation sensorson the right wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. These are the recent added technologies and if we wait a little longer possibilities are endless. They would help lessen the amount of crashes because the sensors tell you when things are around or in the way of the car. Driverless cars could help avoid accidents and although they aren´t fully capable of reducing all accidents they could reduce most accidents.

Gas prices have always gone up and down. No matter what car you drive it requieres fuel. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a public transportation system that use half the fuel of today´s taxis and offere more flexibility than a bus. Driverless cars would be less inexpensive, they could economically help us. Gas prices will most likely not change but instead of spending 50$ on gas wouldn´t you want to spend 25$ on gas or maybe even 30$. Although buying a driverless car would be expensive and mostlikely cost you two arms and a leg in the end it would be worth it.

Lastly I feel like it would be the technology we need to better our future. It would look nice having cars that potentially save pedestrians lives and help the driver stay safe. Some manufacturers hope that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. They also hope that some of the in-car systems could help reduce the amount of people who are on their phones while driving. This type of technology could save endless amount of lives and help better the world.

I feel like driverless cars could help many people. Especially as a teen and driving is new to them it could help because all the sensors would be there to help. Creating and legalizing driverless cars could help economically and safety wise.

F45F03EBB2CA,"Title: Community Service Project Proposal

Introduction

As an eighth-grade student, I believe it is important to give back to the community and help those in need. There are many ways that students can take part in helping the community, and I have researched several ways to support the homeless, hungry, and animals in our area. In this essay, I will propose a community service project for our school to undertake to support these groups. Additionally, I will consider the consequences of having the school perform community service and how this would influence students and the community.

Ways Students Can Help the Community

There are many ways that students can take part in helping the community. One way is to volunteer at a local soup kitchen or food bank to help serve meals to the homeless and hungry. Another way is to participate in a community garden or animal shelter to help care for animals in need. Additionally, students can participate in a school-wide fundraiser to raise money for a local charity or organization.

Proposal for a Community Service Project

I propose that our school undertake a community service project to support the homeless, hungry, and animals in our area. The project would involve several components. First, we would organize a food drive to collect non-perishable food items and donate them to a local food bank. Second, we would organize a clothing drive to collect warm clothing and donate it to a local homeless shelter. Finally, we would organize a pet supply drive to collect food and supplies for animals in need at a local animal shelter.

Consequences of Community Service

Performing community service can have a positive impact on both students and the community. For students, it can help to develop a sense of empathy and responsibility for others. It can also help to build social skills and teamwork. Additionally, it can help to improve academic performance by increasing engagement and motivation. For the community, it can help to address important social issues and improve the quality of life for those in need.

Actions Needed to Implement the Project

To implement this project, the school would need to take several actions. First, we would need to organize the food, clothing, and pet supply drives and promote them to the student body. Second, we would need to coordinate with local organizations to ensure that the donations are delivered to the appropriate places. Finally, we would need to provide opportunities for",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,5
A28940CA5863,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having time, impression, and support are crucial when committing to a career at a young age. In this essay, I will explore the importance of each of these factors and why they are essential for success in any field.

First, time is an essential factor when committing to a career at a young age. It is essential to take the time to explore and research different career options before making a decision. This can involve shadowing professionals in various fields, attending career fairs, and researching the education and skills required for each career. By taking the time to explore and research, young people can gain a better understanding of what they are passionate about and what skills they need to develop to achieve their goals.

Second, impression is another crucial factor when committing to a career at a young age. It is essential to have a clear understanding of what the career entails and what the daily tasks and responsibilities entail. This can involve speaking with professionals in the field, reading about the job, and observing people in the job. By having a clear understanding of what the career entails, young people can make a more informed decision about whether the career is right for them.

Finally, support is an essential factor when committing to a career at a young age. It is essential to have the support of family, friends, and mentors who can provide guidance and encouragement. This can involve discussing career goals with parents, seeking advice from teachers and counselors, and finding a mentor in the field. By having the support of others, young people can gain the confidence and motivation they need to pursue their career goals.

In conclusion, time, impression, and support are crucial factors when committing to a career at a young age. By taking the time to explore and research different career options, having a clear understanding of what the career entails, and having the support of family, friends, and mentors, young people can make more informed decisions and increase their chances of success in any field.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,7
falcon_180b_v1_5,"I believe that arts education is essential for a well-rounded education. Arts education includes music, drama, dance, and visual arts. These subjects are important because they help students develop their creativity and imagination.

Firstly, arts education helps students express themselves in new and different ways. For example, through music, students can express their emotions and feelings in a way that words cannot always convey. Similarly, through visual arts, students can express their ideas and thoughts visually, which can be more powerful than words alone.

Secondly, arts education improves students' critical thinking skills. In drama, students learn to analyze and interpret scripts, characters, and themes. In visual arts, students learn to analyze and interpret different styles and techniques. These skills are transferable to other subjects and are essential for success in higher education and the workforce.

Lastly, arts education promotes cultural awareness and appreciation. Through music, dance, and visual arts, students can learn about different cultures and traditions. This helps them develop empathy and understanding for people from different backgrounds.

In conclusion, arts education is essential for a well-rounded education because it helps students express themselves, improves their critical thinking skills, and promotes cultural awareness and appreciation. Therefore, arts education should be a mandatory part of the curriculum in all schools.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Many people believe that arts education is essential for a well-rounded education, while others think that it should be optional.

728C8B788C4C,"A student goes to school to learn, but the school does not have any special learning equipment. There are only a few teachers at the school, and only a few students per class. The entire class the student is constantly hearing his phone go off, and mom talking in the background, which causes him to not even understand the work he is doing. Eventually, his dog comes into his room, so he stops working and plays with the dog. He never fully understood what he was working on, so he just looked up and answer key later and copied it. The student was schooling online using distance learning through his school. Distance learning is not beneficial to students because the student does not get the hands on experience they need, the student does not make advancements socially, and the student gets distracted by things in his home very easily.

First, distance learning does not provide the same hands on experience as an in person school. Schools have a lot of special and expensive learning equipment for students to use. Someone from home would simply not have access to these tools, whether it be for financial reasons or because they do not know where to get it. This would hinder the students education very severely. Many students are afraid or unmotivated to do things until they try it, then they know if they love doing it and realize that it is not that bad after all. A student from home might not want to try new things because they have never had to before. This could seriously harm a students learning and even harm their future career path if it is bad enough.

Second, students learning from home do not make the same social advancements as someone going to school. Students that go to school every day are exposed to people all day. They must make relationships, talk to people, and work with people to survive in the environment. At home, this is not the case at all. A student learning online from his home does not need to talk to people constantly, nor does the student need to work with others all day. This causes a lack of social skill in the student. In a workplace, social skills are important, and students learning online may not have those skills so they will be fired or not even hired in the first place.

Third, students learning from home have enormous amounts of distractions. A normal school has teachers and administrators to make sure students are well behaved and quiet when they need to be. At home, no one is sitting next to a student ready to silence anything that makes a noise around them. Instead, the student must either let it distract them, or deal with it them self, both of which are hindering the learning experience. Constantly being distracted does not allow a student to focus and deeply understand what they are trying to learn. Not understanding important fundamentals leads to a lot of confusion down the road.

Some people may argue that the cost is lowered by online schooling at home. While this may be true, why hinder a young mind's education just to save a little bit of money? Most schools have buses that can take students to and from school. Many schools offer aid to poor families for things like lunch fees, testing fees, field trip fees, etc. Aid will be given to a family if needed. Keeping a student from going to school just to save money is not the way to go.

In conclusion, distance learning would not be beneficial for students. The distractions would restrict deep learning and understanding of concepts. The experience would not be like a career, nothing hands on, only stuff from a computer. Social skills will not be developed in these students, leading to poor communication skills and possibly even bullying. The best thing a school could do for a student is to do what will open up many opportunities for them. This restricts learning and restricts opportunities, so it would not be beneficial for the students. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
43D612E69031,"Dear Principal,

I think that all of the students that are able to do community service should be required to do at least 9 hours each semester. If they are able to take away from the community they should also be able to give back. Each student should learn what hard work is all about. Some people like to take the privileges and things that we have for granted. I think that by enforcing the community service they will at least feel good about themselves when they ask their parents for something they want. For example, how would you feel if you were a parent and your child would always ask you for things that sometimes are out of your reach? You would probably try to work hard to get your daughter/son that toy or object that they desire so much. Well, what if your child becomes greedy and selfish as they grow older because you didn't teach them the value of everything that they have. You just gave it to them as soon as they asked. Now, what if you gave them everything that they desired, but with the agreement that they would help babysit their small cousins, or help their elderly neighbor clean the house. Then, they would learn the value of things and feel about it when they received what they asked for. In today's society many people are taking advantage of the fact that they don't have to give back to their society or community as much as they take. If you make community service a requirement not only will you be giving our school a good name, but you will also be molding the students into good citizens of the world. You will be instilling in their minds that it is always good to give back to the community and show the world you care. I hope you really take these points I'm making into consideration and I also hope you put yourself on the other end of the stick and pretend (as i mentioned before) that you are a parent with children that always ask for things that are sometimes out your reach. All I want is for you to make the best choice that you think possible for both the school and community, but if you do make the choice I am giving to you here on this letter I can almost reassure you that you won't regret your decision.

BF3CC3305C55,"My phone buzzed with his name appearing at the top. God, I don't wanna talk to you right now, take a hint man. My boyfriend and I had just had a huge fight and I'm texting my friend Generic_Name for advice. After explaining her opinion she says to listen to other peoples advice then decide what to do.

When faced with an issue normally our first reaction is to try to solve it on our own, although most of the time our head is way up in the clouds and we need another person to drag us back to the reality of the issue. Although most times, you need a few more than just that one person to help you make the correct choice. Therefore, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

All in all, getting advice could be a good thing, since many different people have all had vastly different experiences. At the Virginia school of Technology they completed a study on getting advice from just one person compared to reciving advice more more than one person. Both people were given the same issue but only one was able to receive more than one persons advice. One of the conductors of the experiment, Dr. Joy Engstrom, stated that, "" The person who received more than one piece of advice seems to have made the more logical choice than the person with only one piece of advice, fixing the situation faster and healthier."" Therefore, asking more than just one person for advice can help you pull out a stronger and better outcome of the situation. Plus, receiving more advice can also hep you make a more logical choice then acting on what just one other person thinks is best. The advice given also probably would apply to other situations as well, so you are learning and growing as a person.

All the same, receiving advice from more than one person can also help to build trust with the people you ask. A study done by Jake Miller at the Maryland University of Health shows that when someone comes to another person for advice their trust in them normally increases. Mr. Miller Claims that, "" You install a certain level of trust in someone when you ask them for advice, if it be something small or something huge. Asking for their opinion on a situation also boosts the overall relationship."" More over, their advice doesn't only just help the situation it helps strengthen your relationship with those people. Plus, most of the time people are more open to helping you when you have a sturdy relationship with them. Not only does asking for advice show that you trust the people your asking but it can even help strengthen a whole groups relation and trust.

Overall, different sets of advice can also bring you to the best possibly out come. Creating a more logical and better choice to make. At the University of Utah a survey went around asking students if they made better choice when they asked more people for advice or if they made a better choice when they asked one person for advice 70.2% said they made a better choice when asking more people compared to the 29.8% that claimed they made a better choice when asking one person. However, majority claimed the best outcome would be asking just more than one person, still a lot of students replied just one person. From past experiences asking one person can make you think that that option and only that option will be the best, when in reality its actually not. When asking for advice you need someone who gives their opinion on what hey would do, not try to snatch away your judgment and brainwash you to their opinion.

In the end, asking more people for their opinion can not only help you build trust with the people you ask, but help you learn more about them and their experiences and make the best choice. So in the future it is much recommended that you seek more than just one persons opinion on a situation your not so sure about. ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
D6930DD4EDD0,"As an eighth-grade student, I am constantly thinking about what classes I will take in high school and how they will prepare me for my future career. As I research the different types of classes available at my high school, I have come to the conclusion that there are several classes that would be beneficial for my desired career path.

Firstly, I believe that taking a class in computer science would be extremely beneficial for my future career. With the rise of technology, computer science is becoming increasingly important in many industries. Whether I am interested in becoming a software engineer, a data analyst, or a cybersecurity specialist, having a strong foundation in computer science will be essential.

In addition to computer science, I also believe that taking a class in business would be beneficial for my future career. As a student who is interested in entrepreneurship or management, understanding the fundamentals of business will be crucial. This class will teach me how to analyze financial statements, create business plans, and make informed decisions.

Finally, I believe that taking a class in a foreign language would be beneficial for my future career. In today's global economy, being able to communicate effectively with people from different cultures is becoming increasingly important. Whether I am interested in working in international business, diplomacy, or travel, having a strong command of a foreign language will give me a competitive edge.

I have talked to my guidance counselor about these classes, and they have confirmed that they would be beneficial for my desired career path. They have also suggested that I consider taking a class in accounting or marketing, as these skills are also valuable in many industries.

In conclusion, as an eighth-grade student, I believe that taking classes in computer science, business, and a foreign language would be beneficial for my future career. These classes will give me the skills and knowledge I need to succeed in my desired field, and I am excited to begin taking them in high school.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,7
llama_70b_v1343,"I think we should totally transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy! First of all, fossil fuels are finite, which means they'll eventually run out. Renewable energy sources, like solar and wind power, are infinite and won't ever run out. Plus, fossil fuels are really harmful to the environment. They release greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, which contribute to climate change. Renewable energy sources don't release greenhouse gases and are way better for the environment.

For example, solar panels can be used to generate electricity and they don't produce any emissions. Wind turbines can also generate electricity and they're a great source of renewable energy. Hydroelectric power plants use water to generate electricity and they're really clean and efficient.

Another reason we should switch to renewable energy is because it's getting cheaper. The cost of solar panels and wind turbines has gone down a lot in recent years, making them more affordable for people and businesses. Plus, renewable energy creates jobs, which is good for the economy.

I know some people might argue that renewable energy isn't always reliable, like when it's cloudy or the wind isn't blowing. But, we can solve that problem by using energy storage systems, like batteries, to store excess energy for when it's needed.

In conclusion, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy is really important for the environment and the economy. We should totally do it!",1,llama_70b_v1,"In recent years, there has been a push towards using renewable energy sources.

B4DEA93DAA5B,"Today's modern technology is advancing at a faster rate each year and we use it in our everyday lives and helped us in so many ways. Why shouldn't they help us with education?

Technology should be more widely accepted and used in academic settings, as they have many benefits. They have the ability to make learning more engaging, lessons to be more accessible, and overall convenient in certain situations for some people.

Distance learning is an amazing concept and should be offered more in schools, and there are several reasons why it should. Many students with long term illnesses or injuries are not able to attend school because of their current situation. It can result in a negative effect on their academic abilities and may take a toll on their graduation requirements, thus, may prevent them from doing so.

There are also students who have trouble getting to school or are not able to attend school traditionally. Online schooling would be very convenient in their case. They wouldn't have to worry about getting to classes on time and can learn at their own pace.

Distance learning is amazing, but most great ideas can have negative components. Even though technology is advancing, that doesn't mean it's completely flawless. There can be technological issues, for example, the device not being able to connect to the internet properly. There can also be distractions in home settings. Family members, especially young children, can disrupt your attention. And tempting activities like video games and television can do so too. But these problems can easily be fixed compared to the ones that prevents certain students from attending. The positives easily outshines the negatives in this case.",0,persuade_corpus,,8

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the information provided in the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner. Based on the evidence presented, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for the following reasons: its practicality, certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power among states, and avoidance of run-off elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College has proven to be a practical method for electing the President of the United States. The founding fathers established it as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. The process of selecting electors, the meeting of these electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress ensure a fair and constitutionally sound election process. The Electoral College has been successfully used for centuries and changing it would require significant modifications to the Constitution.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in presidential elections. The winner-take-all system in most states means that the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes becomes the President. This system reduces the likelihood of disputes over the popular vote and ensures a clear outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, a dispute over the popular vote is more probable than a dispute over the Electoral College vote. Therefore, maintaining the Electoral College ensures a more stable and predictable election process.

In addition, the Electoral College promotes representation of all regions in the United States. It requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning specific regions and encourages them to campaign across the entire country. It ensures that the interests and concerns of all regions are taken into account in the election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College emphasizes the importance of swing states. This system incentivizes candidates to dedicate more attention and resources to states where the election outcome is uncertain. As a result, voters in these swing states are more likely to be engaged and informed about the candidates' positions and policies. Their thoughtful votes should have a significant influence in deciding the election, and the Electoral College ensures that their voices are heard.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the power among small and large states. The system helps to restore some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. As Judge Posner explains, the Electoral College allows large states to receive more attention from presidential candidates compared to small states. This ensures that candidates must consider the needs and interests of diverse states, promoting a more balanced representation of the nation as a whole.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, avoiding the complications and costs associated with run-off elections. This ensures that the election process remains efficient and effective.

While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote, such as greater fairness to voters and increased attention to all states, the existing system of the Electoral College has proven to be functional, practical, and has multiple advantages that outweigh these potential benefits.

In conclusion, it is important to maintain the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its practicality, certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power among states, and avoidance of run-off elections make it a valuable and effective system. I encourage you to consider these points when evaluating any potential changes to the electoral process.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments presented and make an informed decision that best serves the interests of our nation and its citizens.

Sincerely,

Plus the they sent to mars was just taking pictures of a landing site for viking 1's sister viking 2. The first time they saw the face was when it was all shadowy so you could barely see it but as time past by it was 1998 when they went back up to mars with oe of the vikings to take another picture and it was more clear. They had to 12 years to go back up to mars and I dont think that aliens could build it that fast, it would've at least taken more time to make a good face. Then at the year 2001 they took another picture and it was fading away and I honestly dont think that the aliens would be able to take the face down that fast and why would they have to take it down. It has to be natural because there are no suh things as aliens, because no one from nasa has ever seen one and if they would've Nasa would've told everybody that they have found aliens and that they are real. Also I know its natural because even nasa said that the face had a nose,eyes,mouth, and looked exactly like a humans face.

7A552DBA7D71,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that allowing students to have and use cellphones in the classroom can have a significant impact on academic success. While some people argue that cellphones can be a useful tool for learning, there are also several negative effects that can occur when students use their phones in the classroom.

One of the key effects of having a cellphone in the classroom is that it can be a source of distraction. Students may be tempted to check social media, play games, or text their friends instead of paying attention to the teacher. This can lead to missed assignments, poor grades, and a lack of engagement in class.

Another effect of having a cellphone in the classroom is that it can disrupt the learning environment. When students use their phones, they may talk to each other or make noise, which can be distracting to other students and the teacher. This can lead to a lack of focus and a decrease in academic performance.

Finally, not using a cellphone properly for educational purposes can also have a negative impact on academic success. For example, if a student is using their phone to take notes or research a topic, they may not be using it in the most effective way. This can lead to inaccurate or incomplete information, which can be detrimental to their academic performance.

In addition to these negative effects, there are several reasons why people should not use cellphones in the classroom for non-educational purposes. Firstly, cellphones can be a source of distraction, as mentioned earlier. Secondly, cellphones can be a source of bullying, as students may use them to harass or intimidate their peers. Finally, cellphones can be a source of inappropriate content, as students may access inappropriate websites or apps on their phones.

In conclusion, while some people argue that cellphones can be a useful tool for learning, there are also several negative effects that can occur when students use their phones in the classroom. Not listening to the teacher, not using it properly for educational purposes, and disturbing the class can all have a negative impact on academic success. Therefore, it is important for students to use their cellphones responsibly and for teachers to have clear guidelines in place to ensure that cellphones are used appropriately in the classroom.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,2

Extending the School Day: Pros and Cons

As an 8th grader, I've heard a lot of talk about extending the school day. Some people say it's a great idea, while others think it's a bad one. In my opinion, there are both pros and cons to extending the school day.

One of the main pros of extending the school day is that it would give students more time to learn. With more time in the classroom, we could cover more material and learn more things. For example, if we had an extra hour in the morning, we could do more math problems or read more chapters in our books. This would help us get better grades and be more prepared for standardized tests.

Another pro is that it would give teachers more time to teach. With a longer day, teachers could give more individual attention to students who need it, or they could teach more complex concepts. This would help students who are struggling in certain subjects and give them the extra support they need to succeed.

However, there are also some cons to extending the school day. One of the biggest cons is that it would take away from our free time. As it is, we have a lot of homework and extracurricular activities, and adding more time to the school day would just make things more hectic. We need time to relax and unwind after school, whether that's playing sports, hanging out with friends, or just doing nothing.

Another con is that it could be expensive. Extending the school day would likely cost money for things like new buildings or additional staff, and that could be a burden on taxpayers. It's important to think about how extending the school day would affect our community and whether it's really worth it.

In conclusion, extending the school day has both pros and cons. While it would give us more time to learn and teachers more time to teach, it would also take away from our free time and be expensive. It's important to carefully consider the pros and cons before making a decision. As an 8th grader, I think it's important to have enough time to learn and have fun outside of school, but also to make sure that we're getting the",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay discussing the pros and cons of extending the school day.,7
8452DCB2606B,"Air polution, no money, and death, Oh my! Everywhere you go there are going to be cars. One of the most helpful and loving inventions of our time, it gets us from place to place in a short amount of time. But is getting to where you need to go faster really worth it? Money, safety, and protection to our environment all play huge roles when it comes to cars. The population of our world grows every year, which means more cars... Which means more air polution, more deaths, more of spending your money.

Owning a car also comes a lot of things. Money for gas, money for parts that stop working, etc. With gas prices up and down all the time, we find ourselves spending way too much money just to fill up our vehicle. You would be amazed at how much more money you would have if you weren't spending on gas and other things your car needs. It also requires no excercise at all, which is really a disadvantage to our health. Imagine what a simple difference can make. If we all walked or biked to where we needed to go, we're doing something great for our bodies and our environment. Not only is it jeopordizing our health, but our own environment's, too! Every single car and every single drive is polluting our air. Do we really want to end up like Beijing, China? As of now, they are known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. What about safety? Car crashes are one of the most common deaths. Such as two major factors, texting while drving and driving under the influence. No matter what state you're in, when you get behind that wheel you hold a big responsibility. So is putting your life on the line really worth it?

By limiting car usage, we can make a difference throughout the world. We can lower stress, death rate, air pollution, spendings, and so much more. If ONE day of the Day Without Cars in Columbia made a difference, imagine what a whole year, or years, could make. There are so many better options to get to where you need to go other than cars, such as bikes. So what if you don't get there as fast as you would in a car? The point is, you're still getting there. You're also not putting you and other's lives on the line. Better for the environment, better for others, better for you!                                                                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
BB8DBBD8C4AB,"I agree with this statement, because is hard to be yourself, in a world like this, where the people judge everything in your life, and you have to be how they want, they always are telling you what you have to do or what you not, and they not care about your opinion.

A example:

In my personal life is with my family, they always are telling me what I have to do, and when I do something wrong they judge me, they want to select my friends, my clothes, include my shoes, in a situation like this is difficult to be what you really what to be, and the razon is because they don't give us a chance to demostrate what we really are.

Another example is:

With the people of outside, we never are going to be how they want, if they saw you with a boy who use tattoo they think he is a bad boy, if you are a fat girl your ugly, if you are skinny girl your ugly too, if you use a mini skirt you are a creazy women. So we never will be fine.

Everybody can judge, but we have to be strong, we have to try to demostrate what we are, or what we like to do.

Razons:

We can have a lot of bad situations in this life, Maybe one day we can feel bad or sad, Because we not feel good with the people who judge, maybe we are tired to feign to be another person, or maybe we can think in a negative way. A example of this could be say ""I never do something good"", "" I am not a good person"". So we need to be what we want to be, and love yourself is the most important thing, if you not love yurself no one can love you more then you, obviously we have to know what decisions we want to take, you have to feel good with yourself, with your decisions. You have to show what you are, if you feel good you will be good.

All this are razons for which one is hard to be yourself, and is for that razon i agree with Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson, cause i feel identified with what he say; I feel a winner, i feel happy with my personality, and is because i don't care what the people say, or think about me, is my life, I take my decisions. If I am a creazy women who always is imperative but i feel good with that am fine. I like to be happy, be my self. I really love me. I don't have to feign nothing.

E54E238C6DDB,"I would think that some student's would stay home so they can catch up on things they need but some stay so they can get the help they really need. For example if a parent see's his child struggling they could ask their child and be like do you need help or what do you want us to do to help you. I'm pretty sure that some students are gonna take this opportunity, and take online classes or get the help they need from a teacher or someone they know who can help them. The real reason that I think they will do it is because they would want to graduate from school so they can get the diploma and be happy that they did it with the help of a parent. Yes, I do believe that student's would benefit with taking classes at home or by online classes with a video conferencing. Student's should be grateful that some school's are giving them the opportunity to take some classes at home or even with a teacher they can video chat with and they can help them too. If it wasn't for the school who was giving us the privilege do take this opportunity for the help then we wouldn't be passing anything or getting the help we need. For example, if a student goes to the school and tell's them hey i'm having trouble getting this subject i know for sure the teacher are gonna give them a choice to pick if they want help or take online classes at home with like a teacher who's helping them. Another reason kids ask for help is because they probably ask at home and sometimes's parent's dont have the time to help them cause they are tired from work or they just tell them to ask someone else and then they don't get the help they need. For some student's it's easy for them but for some it isn't easy so some students can help each other so they can understand it. For other reason's it's better for kids to try on there own first and then if they still dont get it then they ask for the help or ask the teacher for help at the same time.

301EA5259E90,"""On your mark get set GOOO!!!"" Some people would miss the sound of NASCAR or other racing events. I personally feel that not having any cars would make the world a better healthier place to live in.

First off I feel that not having any cars would save people a lot of money. Just think what you actually need to pay when you have a car. Once a month you have to pay for a car payment (if it isn't payed off), insurance, and gas. Now think that you also need to have a lisence and have your car registered. In VAUBAN Germany residents don't have cars due to the fact that it costs $40,000 just to own a parking spot. 70 percent of the families there don't own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move there. Now that is a way for the world to survive and now your wallet.

Next I will say how having less cars will affect the world's pollution. The people of the world rely on using cars wether it's to go to another state or just for a drive to the corner store. People have burned so many fossil fuels into the air that smog levels can reach record highs everyday. In Paris their was a day where they almost reached a record high and thye had to take half the people off the road and if they used their car anyway they would get fined. This caused the smog level to go down to a safe level after just five days. Smog can't go away over night do to warm daytime hours and cold night time hours and it would get trapped in an air pocket. But i guess this was just a close call.

My final reason to write would be due to the level stress driving has on people. Just think everyday you have a chance on dieing in a car due to an accedent. You just drive a metal cage at high speeds and have a chance of running into each other. When you are riding a bike you don't ever have to worry about runing into oter people all you think about is that you're having a nice time. Even when you're walking you don't have to stress about people running into you because its just walking. Besides walking is just human nature so why would we stress over it?

In summary I feel that not using cars is helpful due to not having to pay as much, their is less polution in the air and you tend to just be lessed stressed in general. Wouldn't you want to leave this a clean and stress free place?    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

AD25C95CC18A,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I do not believe students would benefit from being able to attend class from home because cheating from websites on the internet would be made easier for them to use, students may not have access to internet or a device that allows them to complete their assignments, and students who are not present in the classroom would miss out on working on their socializing skills with their fellow classmates.

Cheating would be facilitated to the students who are not being supervised and do not have a teacher to go to and ask their questions or concerns. Since the students would not have a teacher explaining and answering their questions, it'll seem easier to them to rely on the internet for a response to their questions, instead of learning and retaining the information. There are countless websites on the internet that will provide students with detailed answers to the questions they have searched and would be easily able to copy and word the answer differently to their responses on the assignment. They could not only access quick and detailed responses from searching them online but by also asking other family member that has already taken the class or the subject.

Students who are absent and who may have limited access to internet at home would be significantly placed at a disadvantage than their classmates. Students not having a device to complete their assignments on, would contribute to placing them behind and without an opportunity to keep the same rhythm the classroom is being taught at. Students may be placed in a situation where internet access is not available or they are physically unavailable to attend the video conference due to family emergencies or illness. Some students might feel like the students who are being taught online are given the advantage of cheating and getting the same grades as them, resulting in tension within the classroom.

Students who attend the class online or by video conferencing would not be able to experience the social interactions that their classmates, who are present in the class, would go through. Interacting and working together to complete group projects or presentations, would help with students with their public speaking and combining the input of different types of students. This kind of social bonding would lead to the students learning new things, not only about the subject of the project or presentation, but of the people they worked with.

All these simple interactions help build up a character in the students that prepares them for when they apply for a job or go to college. The students who are not present in the classroom would miss out on these important lessons and learning experiences that would benefit them in the future.

I believe that students would not benefit from attending online or video conferencing as a way of attending class due to the risk of cheating, limited access to devices or internet at home, and students would be excluded from building social skills that they may need in the future. I understand that some students may learn better alone and in a quiet place like their home. However, these students would be missing out on learning a significant part of attending classes. If your school were to suggest this option of virtual learning, write a letter to your schools Board of Supervisors or your principal, listing these reasons as to why students would not benefit from distance learning. ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
D9FA943B5453,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that schools should have some control over the involvement of extracurricular activities. While extracurricular activities are important for personal development and socialization, they can also take away from academic performance and cause distractions in the classroom.

On the one hand, extracurricular activities provide students with opportunities to explore their interests and develop new skills. Participation in sports, clubs, and other organizations can help students build self-confidence, teamwork, and leadership skills. Additionally, extracurricular activities can provide a sense of community and belonging, which can be especially important for students who may be struggling academically or socially.

However, extracurricular activities can also take away from academic performance. Students who participate in too many extracurricular activities may struggle to balance their commitments and maintain their grades. Additionally, extracurricular activities can be a source of distractions in the classroom, as students may be thinking about their upcoming practices or meetings instead of focusing on their studies.

Furthermore, schools may have different priorities and goals for their students, and extracurricular activities may not align with those priorities. For example, a school may prioritize academic achievement over extracurricular involvement, which could lead to a lack of support for certain clubs or organizations.

In conclusion, while extracurricular activities are important for personal development and socialization, schools should have some control over their involvement. This control can help ensure that students are able to balance their commitments and maintain their academic performance, while also providing opportunities for personal growth and community building.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,1
685ABA004ADB,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is important to learn from one's own mistakes. However, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can also be beneficial. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of both approaches and provide examples of people who have made their own decisions and learned from their experiences.

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be beneficial because it can provide a fresh perspective and potentially save time and resources. For example, if a student is struggling with a particular subject, seeking guidance from a teacher or tutor can help them understand the material more effectively. Additionally, seeking guidance from experts can provide a sense of security and validation, as they may have more experience and knowledge in a particular area.

However, making one's own decisions can also be beneficial. When individuals make their own decisions, they are able to take ownership of their choices and learn from their mistakes. This can lead to personal growth and development. For example, a person who has made a mistake and learned from it may be more likely to make better decisions in the future. Additionally, making one's own decisions can lead to a greater sense of independence and self-confidence.

There are many stories of people who have made their own decisions and learned from their experiences. One such example is Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. Jobs made many unconventional decisions throughout his life, such as dropping out of college and focusing on developing Apple. While these decisions were not always successful, they ultimately led to the creation of one of the most successful companies in the world.

Another example is Oprah Winfrey, who made many difficult decisions throughout her life, such as moving from Mississippi to California and pursuing a career in television. While these decisions were not always easy, they ultimately led to her becoming one of the most successful and influential people in the world.

It is important to learn from one's own mistakes because it can lead to personal growth and development. When individuals make mistakes, they are able to reflect on what went wrong and identify areas for improvement. This can lead to better decision-making in the future. Additionally, learning from one's mistakes can lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and self-reflection.

Not growing up and making one's own decisions can have a negative impact on personal development. When individuals rely too heavily on",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,8
1D391F27318B,"Many people and other scientists believe that the Face was created by aliens. But, I definitely disagree. First, the Face may be shaped like an actual human being's face, but it's not an actual human being face. Clearly, there's sufficient evidence to prove the Face was not created by aliens. For example, there aren't any alien monuments, and there aren't any aliens! Pictures were taken ten times, to make sure that we got clear vision of the face. Even when picture of the Face appeared on the JPL web site, some people and other scientists, thought the Face looked like a natural landform. That's because a a shadow figure kind of looks like a human face, that doesn't mean it's an actual human. Also, never have I ever seen an alien. Contrary to popular opinion, aliens don't even exist. That's almost saying the aliens are going to take over the world.

Then, I have never heard of aliens creating the Face, knowing aliens creating anything else.

The face is a natural landform because it's just a shadow. Before, when Nasa's viking ship took pictures of the shadow, their camera could have had a bad angle and probably tried to make the shadow look like a real human face.

Next, never have I have heard of a viking ship capturing pictures of any aliens. Or, have I never of anyone capturing pictures of any aliens creating the Face.

In conclusion, I still think that the Face is a human landform because, once again, there aren't any aliens. Also, there aren't any alien monuments. I think everybody is just exageratting about the whole thing. Also, people could just be freaked out about what they had heard. Some could agree with me, or some couldn't.

9CB6D9467227," In my opinion, a positive attitude is a crucial factor in achieving success in life. People who maintain a positive outlook on life are more motivated, happier, and work harder towards their goals. While some may argue that having a positive attitude does not make a significant impact on success, I believe that it is a key component of achieving one's goals.

Firstly, a positive attitude helps people stay motivated. When you believe in yourself and your abilities, you are more likely to push through difficult times and continue working towards your goals. It is essential to stay focused on the things that matter most to you and not get distracted by other things that do not align with your objectives. By staying motivated, you can maintain your positive energy and continue working hard towards your goals.

Secondly, a positive attitude helps people maintain a positive outlook on life. If you believe in yourself and your abilities, you are more likely to have a positive energy and a positive attitude. Even if you don't believe in yourself, you can still maintain a positive attitude by reminding yourself of your goals and the benefits of achieving them. By keeping your goals in mind, you can maintain a positive energy and continue working hard towards your objectives.

Thirdly, a positive attitude helps people work harder. When you are motivated, happy, and focused, you are more likely to put in the effort required to achieve your goals. By working harder, you can increase your chances of success and achieve your objectives more quickly. By dedicating your time and energy to your goals, you can make progress towards achieving them and maintain a positive attitude towards life.

In conclusion, a positive attitude is a crucial factor in achieving success in life. It helps people stay motivated, maintain a positive outlook on life, and work harder towards their goals.

CCB5EED97986,"Attitude is a crucial aspect of a person's life. It is the way a person thinks and feels about something or someone, and it can greatly impact their life. In this essay, I will research how attitude can help people's lives, reflect on moments in my life that demonstrate the impact of attitude, analyze my current attitude and consider how I could improve it, examine how my siblings or relatives have affected my attitude, look into how different people react to situations and how their attitudes impact the outcome, and describe how an individual's attitude could help them achieve their goals.

Firstly, research shows that having a positive attitude can greatly improve a person's life. A positive attitude can help a person cope with stress and adversity, improve their mental and physical health, and even increase their lifespan. For example, a study conducted by the Mayo Clinic found that people with a positive attitude were more likely to engage in healthy behaviors such as exercising and eating a healthy diet, which can lead to a longer and healthier life.

In my own life, I have experienced the impact of attitude firsthand. There have been times when I had a negative attitude towards a situation or person, and it only made things worse. On the other hand, there have been times when I had a positive attitude, and it made the situation or person more enjoyable and productive. For example, when I was struggling with a difficult project in school, I initially had a negative attitude towards it. However, after talking to a friend who had a positive attitude about the project, I began to see it in a different light. I started to enjoy the challenge and put in more effort, which ultimately led to a better outcome.

In addition to my own experiences, I have also seen how my siblings' attitudes have affected me. My younger sister, for example, always has a positive attitude, even in the face of adversity. Her optimism and resilience have inspired me to see things in a more positive light, even when things are tough. On the other hand, my older brother has a more negative attitude towards certain situations, which can sometimes bring me down and make me feel discouraged.

9E2DD26ABC63,"The driverless car is the way of the future. It's a great invention that, with time, could eliminate the hassle of having to drive everywhere yourself. Regular cars would become useless when cars could drive themselves. The driverless car is a great invention and development should be supported in the future.

A car that could drive itself would be magnificent. The self driving car could half the fuel of taxis and save people money. Humans would be relatively safe in a self driving car as well. Google has had driverless cars drive for over half a million miles without any incident. The cars are so fabulous that they alert the driver when entering and exiting driveways in order to have maximum safety and minimal crashes.

The driverless car does have some negative aspects as well. The car cannot completely drive by itself and still needs a driver at the wheel at all times. The driver is needed to assist the car in navigating through difficult traffic situations such as a wreck or a road under construction. The cars can only steer, brake, and accelerate by themselves without having a driver involved. People also argue that the cars could also be dangerous. A car that drives manually is frightening for many people who still want to control how fast or how slow their car is going. Putting trust into a car that could possibly wreck is nerve-wracking for many people.

Even though the self driving car does still need a driver, that doesn't mean the driver actually has to manually brake or accelerate. The car does this on its own without human support. All the driver has to do is help the car navigate through complex traffic problems, which are not an everyday occurance. The driver would rarely have to take manual control of the vehicle. The driverless car is a pinnacle of safety that would keep the drivers safe despite the self driving aspect. The cars have an advanced sensor that would respond to driving accidents far better than a human could. If their was a train that was accelarating faster than a cheetah, the self driving car would respond by braking sooner and quicker than the average human ever could.

The driverless car is an advanced technology that would protect drivers and safely get them to their destination. Their is no need to fear these vehicles, the reason being that they have a faster reaction speed than humans could ever develop. The future will be awfully bright when these cars get on the road and drive themselves.

7B6FA03518AE,"Hey there!  So, you know how people always say ""patience is a virtue""? Yeah, they're not just talking about being nice or anything. Developing patience can actually help you achieve your goals way faster and better than if you just rush into things. 

First of all, let's talk about why patience is important. When you're patient, you take the time to think things through, and that means you're less likely to make mistakes. Like, imagine you're trying to build a Lego castle. If you just start throwing Lego pieces together without thinking about it, you're gonna end up with a big ol' mess. But if you take your time and plan it out, you can make sure everything fits together just right and you get the perfect castle! 

Another thing that's super important is that when you're patient, you're more likely to find the best solution to a problem. Like, let's say you're trying to solve a puzzle. If you just start flipping pieces around willy-nilly, you might not find the solution right away. But if you take your time and think about it, you might figure out a better way to solve it. 

And lastly, being patient can actually help you avoid getting frustrated or upset. Like, think about it. When you're in a hurry, it's easy to get annoyed or angry when things don't go your way. But if you take a deep breath and be patient, you can calm down and find a solution that works for everyone. 

So, in conclusion, developing patience is super important for achieving your goals. It helps you think things through, find the best solutions, and avoid getting frustrated. So, next time you're feeling rushed or stressed, just take a deep breath and be patient.

8DA0B80420FC,"some schools believe that students should be given projects over the summer to assure they learn, should theses projects be teacher or student designed? although teachers can make sure students doing what they need; I personally believe that it should be student because students can make it more a peeling to one another, it helps builds creative students, and shows your city you are getting your youth involved.

First, student can make it a peeling for one and another, many will only do it if the works grabs their attention. The more students what to do the project the mare effort or thought will be put in to it. who better to make a project to keep students attention the the students themselves. Because while students are on break many do not have people to push them and make sure they are doing their work so it has to be a project that they would want to do on their own. and if a blunder is made the student can't say they didn't understand because the students designed the projects. This will be a way to grab the attention of whoever grades the project, like a hook in a essay.

Next, it will help build creative students, just as school is supposed to do for students. Yes schools are a place of learning, but while students are in school they are building creative thoughts that are just waiting to be used. giving the students the chance to design their summer summer project helps give the schools notice of what future creator you are putting into the world. If the students are creating their own summer project it teaches then about Independence, and that they don't need a teacher standing over top of them to do their work. With student designing their own project it will make great business skills.

Last, It shows the city you are getting the students involved. After all the students in our school system now are our future town council, school bored leaders, and teachers. so I'm sure the school bored would be pleased to hear that while students are going on their summer break they are not only doing but designing their summer project. Students after the summer can come to tell the public about there how designing their own project helps them in independence and self learning. Although many students may not care for it it will help them keep what they learn and learn new thing researching and designing their summer project.

To sum it all up, although although teachers can make sure students are doing what they need; I personally believe that it should be student designing the summer project. And students can make it more a peeling to one another, it helps builds creative students, and shows your city you are getting your youth involved are just three of many reason. This is why I believe that students are the ones that should design the summer project.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to advocate for the continuation of the Electoral College as the method of selecting the president of the United States. While there are compelling arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College holds several advantages that make it the better choice.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome is reduced when compared to a direct popular vote. With the winner-take-all basis used by most states, even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This sense of certainty and clear decision-making is important for maintaining a stable political environment.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president is everyone's president. Unlike a popular vote system, the Electoral College requires a candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own, which encourages candidates to campaign in a diverse range of states and appeal to a broad spectrum of voters. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected and promotes a president who can represent the interests of the entire nation.

Thirdly, the focus on swing states in the Electoral College system makes campaigns more engaging and thoughtful. As supported by Judge Posner's argument, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes motivates candidates to concentrate their efforts on swing states. This leads to more intensive campaigning and a higher level of attention given by voters in those states. Swing state voters are more likely to be thoughtful and informed, resulting in an election where the most engaged citizens have a greater say in determining the outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the power between big and small states. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College grants more attention to large states due to their larger number of electoral votes. This helps to restore balance, as the mal-apportionment of the Senate disproportionately affects small states. By giving more weight to large states in the presidential election process, the Electoral College ensures that the concerns of both small and large states are taken into consideration.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. This reduces the complexity of the election process and provides a clear winner. As demonstrated by past elections, such as Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College has successfully avoided the need for run-off elections while still producing a decisive result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has shown its value in providing certainty, ensuring a president who represents all regions, promoting thoughtful campaigns, balancing the power between states, and avoiding run-off elections. While there are valid arguments for a popular vote system, I believe the advantages and practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College outweigh the disadvantages. I kindly urge you to consider these points when making decisions regarding the selection process for the president of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing you continue the important work you are doing for our state.

Sincerely,

69B52531C7B0,"Vacations, relaxation, free time- these are just a few of the things students look forward to when the last day of school rolls around and summer vacation begins. But unfortunately summer is not just fun, students must maintain learning as well. From reading assignments to math packets summer work is inevitable, but if we change the guidelines to be more individualistic and open ended, students may be more motivated to utilize their knowledge in a meaningful way. Although teacher-designed projects may prepare students for the course ahead, summer projects should be student-designed because it will allows students to open their minds to creativity, projects will be more enjoyable and of higher quality, and it would be easier to manage.

Student-designed projects promote creativity, which is one of the most useful skills today. Class curriculum is bound by specific expectations and allows little room for self driven deeper thinking. So, a student-based project would allow for students to explore topics that interest them and prompt them to dive deeper. When projects are less constricted and more open to interpretation, the outcome is an individualistic product that showcases one's individuality. For example, throughout different leadership clubs or classes students must come up with their own leadership project and propose a plan to achieve a specific goal. With each student having a different goal, each project is unique and expresses one's true self, with goals ranging from benefiting the homeless to saving the environment. The projects are not teacher-designed and allow the student to explore their mind and come up with something creative yet specific to them. Skills like these are important to exercise because creativity and individuality is what will set one person apart from another in the real world, careers, and competition.

Not only will student-designed projects prompt individuality, but they will also result in a higher quality product. When a project is based on something a person is genuinely interested in, it will lead them to enjoy the work they are doing. When one enjoys the work they are doing, they do a better job at it. For instance, we have been raised to pick a career that we enjoy because those who love their job are the ones that do it best. Therefore, we should do summer projects and school work the same way. Teacher-designed projects that restrict creativity will be dreadful and considered as busy work to the student, which will result in work that is simply complete just to get checked off. But incorporating open ended possibilities will make summer learning more enjoyable compared to the endless stream of work during a regular school year, where close to everything is teacher-based. Teachers also would enjoy seeing projects of high quality that showcase an individual's drive to explore new things that are enjoyable to them rather than a repeat of the same five step project over and over again. Student-designed projects will increase the quality and pleasure of the required summer work load.

Along with summer projects, students also need to balance work, family trips, and just enjoying life as a kid. Student-designed projects will allow one to manage their time in way that incorporates the project to their convenience. The regular school year brings enough stress with constant strict deadlines and expectations, so summer should be the time to let students breathe and mold projects around the components of break itself. No kid wants to work on their biology summer project during their beach vacation, but for example, students could incorporate an ocean or sea life based aspect to a self created project, that will not take away from the time spent on break. A trip to Europe can expand on a history project, rather than textbook readings and vocabulary words. Also, many teenagers are expected to maintain a job and earn money, and they may not have enough time to do a project molded by teachers who do not know details to each student's home life schedule. Students deserve the opportunity to indulge in a project that they believe fits best for themselves and the responsibilities they must tackle during the time that is meant to be a break from it all. Self-based projects will allow for students to incorporate learning into enjoyable things, so that is it more doable for them.

The warm weather and pool days should not be the only things students have to enjoy over summer break. With a student-designed project that is molded to an individual's schedule and interests, summer work could become enjoyable too. A rigid school year routine allows for a more flexible summer, which should also allow for a more flexible workload. Summer projects should be student-designed because they will prompt individuality, be of higher quality, and be done without extra stress to the teen. Making room for creativity and self-interest will result in a project that is more beneficial to the students in general. Enough of the expectations from students are teacher- designed, and as a society we would be surprised as to what amazing outcomes can come from promoting more individuality and freedom throughout learning.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
F81CE83F07A9,"As seen in paragraph 2 it says how venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size,but it also says that there were attempts to launch unmanned aircraft onto the planet and non of them lasted a few hours which is why there hasn't been an aircraft actually to land on venus. Paragraph 2 shows a little taste of how dangerous venus is but it is enticing to learn more about the planet itself. In paragraph 3 it explains how venus's atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and the clouds are highly corrosive with temperatures reaching more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These are even more reasons on why it is dangerous but yet you would wanna know more about it.

The reason why scientists wanna know more about the planet even though it is dangerous is because in paragraph 4 it says That ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Which is another reason why scientists wanna know more about venus and what it has in store. The planet seems to be a very cool place to live without all the set backs with the atmosphere and the corrosive clouds. The scientists of NASA have an idea on how to send a manned vehicle to venus without getting into all the dangerous areas by putting a blimp like air vehicle hovering 30 miles above all of the bad and dangerous chemicals and heat.

The reason it would be a very good thing to study on is because of it being similar to earth in many ways. One reason why is said in paragraph 8 in which it states "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Which i do agree on this being a good cause because not only do we get knowledge but we get more into it which is a dangerous route but it is for the good of man and how not only will we be able to put man on Venus one day but to be able to further our own civilitation. Another dangerous part about the exploration is that we go back to the part where it says no aircraft has ever been able to withstand only a few hours of the planets atmosphere,but as it says in paragraph 7 they are making a vehicle that can survey and gain knowledge on the planet instead of sending a vehicle on the planet. Scientists will be able to gain the knowledge on how to produce a product for NASA that can both withstand the harsh heat and atmosphere but move on the planet like a rover.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
1c63fc04,"Some of the advantages of limiting car usage is definitely that it would help not polute the air. With so many people driving cars in small towns that can quickly polute the air, especially in paris in source two where it says ""After days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" With all of that pollution it can cause things such as global warming, and unhealthy air for our bodies. With just a small break of not driving the congestion was down to 60 percent in the capital of france, after five days of intensifying smog. Also with cold nights and warm days that also causes air to trap car emissions.

Another advantage of not driving cars, would be exercise. That would be such a good work out because you would have no other option except to walkie your bikes. You would get to socialize with everyone else who is walking to their jobs, or the grocery store all while getting a little bit of exercise with your family. With everyone walking and having nothing better to do, sports centers and parks activity has bloomed throughout the city, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up with sales.

More and more people have stopped getting carslicenses and instead taking the city bus, walking or riding their bike. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. If more people would continue to either car pool or find a different way to get where they're going the worlds pollution would definitely begin to go down. Without all of the pollution that comes out of cars and that gets trap into the air, our air would begin to get so much more cleaner and safer for us to breathe.

With all of the money it takes to repair the roads, and the electricity it takes to run all of the stop lights, that money could go towards other things if people didnt drive as much as they do. Although many people need and use their cars for transportation theres always other ways to getting around town. It would also help save you money that is spent on gas every week, with the gas prices being unpredicatable every day.

With all of these advantages of not driving cars as much or at all, it would really help protect the worlds air, and could be a great source of exercise! Walking or riding your bike to wherever you need to go, or even just taking the city bus for two dollars. Also saving your money and spendind it on something else rather than wasting it on gas, or getting your car fixed. Or simply even buying a car, which can cost thousands of dollars.",0,train_essays,,6
FC01486A3507,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard about the new academic rule, requiring a B average to play a school sport. For many kids a B average is tough to come up with especially for those are involved in other activities outside of school. You must realize that we are kids and coming up with a B average with all the homework and tests and quizzes that our teachers give is are really hard to complete, along with other extra-curricular activities and other athletics we are associated with.

Being part of an athletic team means a lot to a kid like me. Being able to participate in our interests and the things we enjoy and love to do is just wonderful. If you are going to take that away from many kids, then a lot of kids may proceed to do even worse. That is definitely not what you want. I think that the C average was fine the way it was and is a good academic goal for some of us.

I think many other kids would be able to come up with a B average if you told your teachers to cut down on the homework and quizzes somewhat. Being part of other athletic team and social groups does not give me much time to do my homework. Kids should be able to experience the 'right kind of childhood' and with all this homework and tests, I am staying up until at least eleven o' clock every night trying to complete my homework or studying for a test. To me, eleven o'clock on a school night is way to late, which is leaving me tired every day and not being able to perform to my full potential.

You might say that school is more important than anything else and that if we do not have enough time to do our homework, that we should just quit, or stop attending those extra activities. Quitting those other activities would leave our middle school careers with nothing but homework and studying. Doing homework and studying all day long will bore your students and eventually most of us will stop completing our tasks assigned. As kids, free time is very valuable to us. Participating in other activities makes us well-rounded students and most importantly 'who we are'.

Lastly, I think this rule is a little to strict. I think this because not only are we assigned a great amount of work, some of us are learning harder criteria than others and that is definitely not fair. Overall, I believe what we are given is tough and a challenge to complete. Those are only a few reason why I believe you should re-think about that rule change. I hope you put great thought into even possibly changing this rule back to the way it was and in my mind should be. Thank you.

FF7ADCC6146A,"I believe that driverless cars are a great invention for the people. It would be great for anybody in my personal opinion. I believe the sensors, Dubbed LIDAR, and GPS receiver are great idea's fr a driverless car. Say you spilled a drink while you were driving and you needed to grab the cup before the liquid from the cup gets all over your school bag, or work porfolio? You could always switch on the ""driverless"" car feature and clean it up real quick before you started driving again. I like how you can switch this on and off. Say you were feeling sleepy and you were awake but you were kinda drowsy? You could use the driverless care feature. The vibrateing seats from Gm, The flashing lights informing you that there's something you need to do so take the wheel. Those are both great and fantastic idea's.

Safety is a big concern in these cars. Can the car stop when needed? can the car set off air bags in the middle of a crash so the crash is less deadly and there are no fatalities?

yes, i believe the cars in the future will be able to do everything listed above, and more. If somebody is injured by a smart car i believe it should be the manufactures fault, but only if the person driving the car is actually using the smart car feature. If the person driving the car isn't using the feature then the driver should be held responsible",0,persuade_corpus,,4
37E07916B614,"Whether it's a crime or a dangerous activity, one bad decision can completely ruin your life. This is why many people, including myself often seek advice from others before making important decisions. Asking for advice from multiple people is very beneficial as you see the many views on the decision at hand, you feel reassured when making the decision, and you avoid repeating the same mistake.

Asking multiple people for advice is extremely important as it provides different perspectives on the choices available to you. As long as you ask the right people, different perspectives change peoples opinion and lead them to making the right choice. An example of when seeing multiple perspectives helped me was when I was skeptical about joining the Model UN team at my school. I thought it would be a waste of time, but when I asked my parents, they told me otherwise. They listed reasons for why they thought it would be best if I joined it and because of this, I joined the team. If I hadn't asked for advice, then I wouldn't have seen their perspectives and therefor wouldn't have decided to join the team.

Often, people get stuck and are unable to make a decision. They then abandon the opportunities that were there because they didn't get help. However, seeking advice from trustworthy people reassures that they are making the right choice and prevents them from trying to run away from the decision. This then leads to people feeling confident in themselves after they have decided what to do, and promotes them trying harder because they believe they're doing the right thing.

Most people can't remember a single thought they had the day before, but many still remember the wise advice they were given years upon years ago. This demonstrates the importance of asking multiple people for advice as you will often remember it, preventing you from repeating the same mistake. I have heard many stories where people continue to commit the same crimes over and over again until they finally seek advice from trustworthy individuals and stop. This emphasizes the need to get advice even when you have already made a mistake.

In conclusion, asking others for advice is often vital to making the right choices. It provides you with different perspectives, reassures that you are making the right choice, and prevents you from repeating the same mistake. While it isn't necessary to seek advice for every choice, it is important to find trustworthy people to help you make decisions that severely impact your life.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
AEC9BAA4E7B1,"In the United states, it important to attend school whenever possible. After all, missing a single day could cause a snowball effect to start and one could fall behind easily. Some schools have started offering distance learning to allow students to attend class from home via video conference. This ingenious idea could potentially drastically reduce the negative effects of absences. It greatly benefits those who are sick for long periods of time or hospitalized, grants a level of accountability that discourages skipping school, and facilitates a faster class pacing through a reduction of wasteful review time.

Most, if not all people have experienced being sick at one point or another. There's many ways to get sick and many ways your body protects itself. When one gets the stomach flu, they should take a day to get better before returning to school, but for those who are chronically ill or hospitalized, this might not be an option. With distance learning as an option, those who are bedridden or otherwise physically incapable of getting to school for an extended period could continue to further their education and not have to worry about making up assignments when they get back. With the current system in place for homework and school projects, it's exceptionally easy to have a few days of medical leave turn into a huge headache for the sick individual, but with distance learning, a diligent student could maintain their grades and sanity even if they are incapable of being at school in person.

Keeping in mind that not everyone might have a positive attitude about school, it is important to note the accountability that comes with a distance learning option. Students would be less inclined to miss school on purpose because they would still be accountable for being in class over video. Without a doctors note or an email from a parent, it would be incredibly difficult for someone to get away with skipping class both physically and digitally without getting caught in their lie. Through this clever trick, schools would be able to crack down on the students who regularly skip school for various reasons. In this way, distance learning benefits students with an attitude problem almost as much as it benefits those with health issues.

Additionally, the distance learning system benefits teachers. With students in class physically or digitally an overwhelming majority of the time, teachers would not need to recap their last lesson as often because the students were there and don't need as much of a refresher. This would allow teachers greater flexibility in their teaching schedules, letting them breeze through the topics that students find easy in order to linger longer on more challenging material. Not only does this freedom give teachers the ability to get through material faster, but it also allows them to teach more effectively and efficiently.

One might argue that distance learning could enable cheating, but there are ways to implement it in a way that significantly reduce the chances that it's taken advantage of. For example, attending a class via video conference could count as being tardy instead of an absence or attendance, which would allow use of the system, but discourage reliance on it. Students would still need their assignments turned in physically, and would not be able to test using the call.

In conclusion, the benefits of a distance learning system far outweigh any possible negative side-effects. Such an option would encourage each student to give their education top priority. Allowing students to attend class even when sick or physically impaired would invite them to show their true colors and would allow those who push themselves to continue to achieve their goals and aspirations. Distance learning should be an option offered by every school, to promote a bright future for every student.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
93552F3ACA5D,"The digital age has changed the landscape of interpersonal relationships and provided us with a multitude of tools to communicate in a wide variety of ways. While these tools have enabled us to connect with friends and family from around the world, technology has also had some negative effects on relationships as well. A major issue lies in the amount of time that is devoted to and is lost with social media. Spending too much time on social networks such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook can have a significant impact on relationships. It can create a disconnect between people by replacing face-to-face contact with virtual interaction. Furthermore, individuals may find themselves more comfortable confiding in social media apps rather than discussing their problems with their friends in person. Finally, the reliance on technology can lead to a lack of basic social skills such as active listening and reading body language; skills that form a vital part of forming and maintaining relationships.

6531927DF837,"The mind can perform differently when extensively staring into a phone screen and causes a lot of distractions in the classroom setting depending on how it's used. As for educational purposes, using a cellphone to probably schedule some test dates, or save notes for later use can really improve keeping track of class subjects and assignments, considering most individuals carry their cellular devices on them every time of the day. We also have notifications on our devices to notify us on when we've missed an important assignment or other things.

The real issue is whether the students are actually taking advantage of it's dependability to actually improve their classroom performance. The human brain can be effected on how long you use the phone regardless of where you are, and that issue goes across all devices. When having used your phone maybe in the middle of the night before a major test, your sleep is cut by maybe an hour due to the eyes being exposed to blue light shifts, which is the brightness of the phone seeping into your eyes, so it is very critical on how the person uses the device before, during, and after school.

Now another big issue is having the freedom and functionality to use the phone however you'd like. This is where a teenager's habit of text, calling, or sending pictures, brings up the debate of using cellphones for educational purposes. It is very easy to get distracted by other uses of the phone while also very easy to take answers from maybe a friend or find cheat sheets online. We don't have the right to control how people use their phone and that's where my opinion on it leans towards restriction policies and or, giving full responsibility to the teacher about when they can use their phone.

Our phones are also effectively useful for keeping a calendar and keeping us notified of the important things in life especially in the educational sense where paper and memory just don't suit us very well anymore in this day and age. Phone's are evolving rapidly and manufacturers are finding new ways of making them more useful for work, school, and social media. Modern education now requires plenty of technology to keep us updated, and there will eventually be a day where education is fully integrated into computers and touch screen devices.

I do agree we need some form of policy or agenda to make use of the phone to help our student's with how they're approaching their education. Teachers must have to conduct the convenience of the phone and whether a certain student can use it properly and educationally. It is a unique creation we have come to experience in our time, and I hope our generation can think heavily on this matter with a progressive and open mind. All it takes is serious debate and rationality for both sides of a subject matter to be comfortable and conclude with what helps us most while also advancing our students properly.",0,original_moth,"Task: Research how the use of cell phones in the classroom affects academic performance and engagement.

6646414809D0,"Dear Principle,

When it comes to community service there are many opinions. Some people may think it's a waste of time, others may believe that everyone should participate. Community service helps everyone including ourselves. For example if we help repaint a local play ground then everyone could enjoy a place were people go to relax and have fun with their children. People don't go to a park to look at graffiti.

Community service may be a choice but if students were required to perform community service then the students may be able to see what they're doing for their community. A majority of students would be upset if it would be held after school and many parents and staff would be upset if it was held during school hours.

I believe that school should make a hour for students to do community service that could benefit the school if possible. If community service was held during school for the school I think that many people would be able to agree that it would benefit almost every one. Students would learn to appreciate what our parents are paying for with their taxes and the nice school that we have, the staff wouldn't have to go around covering up graffiti in our bathrooms that students made, and our parents would be happy that we put aside other things to help out our community. So if you would make it a requirement for us to do community service then many people will be thankful for just the little change you made that helped a wide range of people.

AAE16C990870,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that Winston Churchill's statement ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm"" is a very accurate and inspiring quote. In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get discouraged by setbacks and failures, but Churchill's words remind us that success is not defined by how many times we fail, but by how we respond to those failures.

First of all, Churchill's quote emphasizes the importance of enthusiasm in achieving success. Enthusiasm is the driving force behind any successful endeavor. Without it, we are more likely to give up when faced with obstacles and setbacks. Enthusiasm helps us to stay motivated and focused on our goals, even when things get tough. It's what keeps us going when we feel like quitting.

Furthermore, Churchill's quote reminds us that failure is a natural part of the journey to success. We all experience setbacks and disappointments in our lives, but it's how we respond to those failures that defines our character and determines our success. Instead of getting discouraged by failure, we should view it as an opportunity to learn and grow. We can use our failures as stepping stones to achieve greater success in the future.

Finally, Churchill's quote teaches us that success is not a destination, but a journey. It's not about reaching a specific goal or achieving a certain level of success, but about the process of striving towards our goals and never giving up. Success is a continuous journey, and we must be willing to embrace both our successes and our failures as part of that journey.

In conclusion, I believe that Winston Churchill's statement ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm"" is a very inspiring and accurate quote. It reminds us of the importance of enthusiasm, the naturalness of failure, and the journey-like nature of success. We should strive to embrace both our successes and our failures as we work towards achieving our goals and living a fulfilling life.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,5

8CB337D8D65C,"Should students benefit and be allowed to be homeschooled ?

In my honest opinion, I think student should benifit from being homeschooled is that, There would be less distractions then there are in an actual public schools or private schools then there are in Home school communities.

I think this true because there are alot of distractions in school and students do not realize that those distractions could be the cause of the reason as to why they are not learning and possibly why they might be failing their classes. For example, Students usually arrive late to class only because they hanging out with their friends in the halls and paying less attention to what their timely scheduele is at school, and if a student arrives late to class, They have missed part of what they are about to learn for the day and distract others from their learning.

Another reason why students could benefit from being homeschooled is that, There would be no attendance policy and you get to learn things faster. I think this is true because, There are always those types of students who always arrive to school/class late and have already missed out on half of the lesson only beacuse they couldn't get thereselves up in the morning just to get to school. Also, walking into class late not only ruins your learning time but it also distracts others who are trying to learn. If you get home schooled you are also learning things faster, Because, you don't have anybody holding you back from you learning time and you get to move on in a faster pace then others; For example, Say if some students cannot figure out how to complete a lesson, It just makes it slower for the class because everyone has to understand the subject in order to move on to the next portion of the lesson.

However, Reasons as to why I do not think students would benefit from going to school at home. The reason why I think this is true is because the amount of time of learning that would be set up at home would be diffrent at home then at school; for example, students might get to comfortable at home and might think they can get up from bed at whatever time they please. Another example of why a student would not benefit from going to school at home is because, the home school student would be distracted by their surroundings. Since the student is are very familiar with their enviroment at home, it would be very hard to pay attention and listen to what you are learning only because you are distracted of your familiar surroundings.

6F5447623086,"Having a driverless car may be the gretest or the worst thing someone could have. I am not against on driverless cars because they can be safe, prevent texting and driving accidents, and they alert you when you need to take control of the car. Not only because they drive themselves mean that they are amazing, it can just help to prevent accidents more often.

Driverless cars may be safer than an actual person driving. A mother may have to give the bottle to the baby because it won't stop crying and the car can take care of driving while the mother feeds the baby. Maybe they are listening to music and are more into the music than into the driving. A driverless car can take care of pressing the brake at the right time to stop before something happens. Also that person may not be in good conditions to drive the car and need to get to a doctor or something. That would be if there isn't something else out there that will have to make you take control of the car.

These driverless cars alert you when you need to take the wheel and control it yourself. It is a good thing becuase they probably know that they can't drive through what is happening. Like said in the passage, their can be a traffic jam or there can be an accident and that would be a reason why the car will alert you. It would be a bad thing that the car wouldn't tell you when to take over because it would just stop working all of the sudden and that would't be good. But what would be good is to prevent you from having a accident while texting.

Many teens and even adults now text while driving. They feel like if they don't respond at that instant moment the world is going to end or something. A driverless car can prevent that becuase it can be driving itself and you could answer a call or a text and then get back to driving. The car can prevent you from having an accident from not paying attention to the road. Also maybe you can't find your phone and it keeps on rinigng and it distracts you so the car can take care of the driving while you search for the phone.

In conclusion having a driverless car can be a great thing because you can respond an emergency text without having a fear of dying, it can be safe for you and passengers, and it alerts you when you need to take control. It can be a good thing for the future because more and more technology comes out each year and we are always amazed by everything we see.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
B4B2CB4AA07F,"The School Board's plan to add one and a half hours to the school day is a controversial issue that has sparked both positive and negative reactions from students, parents, and teachers. While some argue that the additional time will provide students with more opportunities for learning and academic success, others argue that it will negatively impact student-teacher relationships, student activities, and students' health. In this essay, I will analyze the potential advantages and disadvantages of the School Board's plan and consider how it could affect different stakeholders.

One of the potential advantages of the School Board's plan is that it could provide students with more time for learning and academic success. With an additional hour and a half, students would have more time to complete assignments, review material, and ask questions. This could lead to improved grades, test scores, and overall academic performance. Additionally, the extra time could allow for more personalized instruction and support for students who may need it.

However, the addition of extra time to the school day could also have negative consequences. One potential disadvantage is that it could negatively impact student-teacher relationships. With more time in the school day, teachers may feel pressured to cover more material, which could lead to less time for building meaningful connections with their students. This could result in a more transactional relationship between teachers and students, rather than a more collaborative and supportive one.

Another potential disadvantage is that the extra time could negatively impact student activities. With more time in the school day, students may feel overwhelmed by the amount of work they need to complete. This could lead to a decrease in participation in extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, or clubs. These activities are important for students' social and emotional development, and a decrease in participation could have long-term negative effects.

Parents may also be negatively impacted by the School Board's plan. With an additional hour and a half, students would be in school longer, which could make it more difficult for parents to pick up their children. This could lead to increased stress and anxiety for both parents and students, as they may feel separated for longer periods of time.

Finally, students' health could also be negatively impacted by the School Board's plan. With more time in the school day, students may be more likely to sit for extended periods of time, which",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,3
5BAD13A833BC,"A computer reading your emotions? In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smila"" the author talks about how Facial Action Coding System is able to read emotions and how it may help students in the classroom. This technology in a classroom will not be beneficial because it is costly, may distract students, invades privacy, and may lead to ineffective learning.

In paragraph 7 the author states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"". The average home PC's price ranges from about $200 USD to $500 USD. Since the average home computers can not handle these algorithms then the school must purchase higher end computers which will be very costly since every student will need one. Also every student travels throughout the school so the school must be able to purchase laptops with this advanced hardware and software so that the students will be able to use them in every class they attend.

In paragraph 6 of the article the author states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and ""then it could modify the lesson"". When in a lesson at school not every student will enjoy the lesson, which will cause them to have a bored or even tiresome expression. Having this expression will cause the computer to attempt and make the lesson more intresting; but what if the student is still bored? The computer will keep trying to modify the lesson which could cause it to lead away from the original goal of the lesson so much that the student is no longer focused on the original topic.

Having a computer constantly reading your emotions will invade on your privacy. Paragraph 6 states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" ""Then it could modify the lesson"". When detecting the student is bored or confused it will have to relay this information to the teacher letting them know that due to the student's emotion that it will be modifying the lesson to accomodate them. This means that when a student may be having a bad day or may just be in a bad mood that it will recognize that and store that information so that the teacher can know. The student may not have wanted anyone to know but now this program doesn't allow that student his right to privacy.

Since this program will be modifying your lesson due to your emotions it may lead away from what the teacher was originally trying to teach. If the intended goal is to teach the student how the mitochondria works withing a cell but the student has a bored face on the program will try to modify the lesson. When the lesson is modified it will try to catch the attention of the student even if it has to continue modifying th elesson. The lesson can be modified to such an extent that the student does learn the lesson partially but not as exstensively as the teacher had originally intended.

Facial Action Coding Systems is a great asset in scientific field. The program though is not practicial within a setting such as a classroom. The program may lead to expensive purchases for the school, more distractions for the students, privacy invasion, and lessons which do not teach exactly as intended. ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

The author supports this idea by giving facts on how studying this planet could be beneficial to us. In the text it states ""Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Since Venus was most like Earth we could learn how time changed Venus from possibly being covered in oceans and could have supported life to extreme conditions far from anything humans have encountered.

B8EE6B6594BD,"Sure, here's my essay on whether the length of summer vacation for high school students should be changed:

Summer vacation is one of the most anticipated times of the year for high school students. It's a time to relax, recharge, and have fun with friends and family. However, the current length of summer vacation, which is typically around 3 months, has been a topic of debate among educators and students alike. Some argue that the length of summer vacation should be shorter, while others believe it should remain the same. In my opinion, the length of summer vacation should be changed, and here's why.

Firstly, a shorter summer vacation would allow students to have more time to focus on their studies during the school year. With a shorter summer break, students would have more time to review and reinforce the material they learned during the previous school year, which would help them perform better in their classes. Additionally, they would have more time to prepare for standardized tests and college entrance exams, which are crucial for their future academic and professional success.

Secondly, a shorter summer vacation would provide students with more opportunities to engage in extracurricular activities and internships. Many students use their summer vacation to participate in sports, music, or art programs, which help them develop their interests and skills. However, with a longer summer break, these opportunities may be limited, as many programs have shorter sessions or require students to commit to a longer period of time. By reducing the length of summer vacation, students would have more chances to participate in these activities, which could help them develop their passions and explore their career options.

Lastly, a shorter summer vacation could help reduce the summer learning loss that many students experience. Research has shown that students tend to forget some of the material they learned during the school year over the summer months, which can negatively impact their academic performance in the following school year. By reducing the length of summer vacation, students would have less time to forget what they learned, which could help them maintain their academic skills and performance.

However, some people argue that a shorter summer vacation would be detrimental to students' well-being. They claim that students need time to relax and recharge after a long school year, and that a shorter summer",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

A35F3D111E9A,"One need not look very far to find proof of the concept that growth can only happen if one is willing to step out of their comfort zone and try something new and challenging. Take, for instance, the story of John, a successful web-developer who had been working in the same position for the past five years. Despite his happiness in his job and consistent success, he felt a nagging feeling that he wanted to try something different. So he decided to take a risk and enrolled in a course in web-design, something which he had never tried before. Though the course was challenging and he had to put in a lot of extra effort, he eventually found success and was able to switch to a new career working in web-design.

The potential risk associated with trying something new is failure and disappointment. The potential reward of trying something outside of one's comfort zone is the satisfaction of having gained new knowledge and experiences, ultimately leading to greater happiness and success. The statement “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow in life” is certainly true—at least for John.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Analyze the statement ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow in life"".

He did not become president because the ellectoral college voted for the other person. That is unfair because no matter what the citizens say, they are not even completly sure that the president they voted for was going to win. For example, in the year 2000, a little bit after Al Gore, they won the popular vote, but they did not win the presidency because they did not win the electoral vote, according to Source 2. Citizens of the United States should be allowed to a direct vote because in 2000, 60 percent of voters voted that they prefer a direct election, and because the voters are not voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors.

To begin, according to source 2, ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes."" This quote from Source 2 is explaining what your vote couts for when you go to elect for a president. Those electors are anyoen who doesn not own a public office. Who elects the electors is the state.

In addition, this year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency and yet, the electoral college still has its defenders, states in source 2.

All in all, the electoral college is unfair to voters, because the winner takes it all system does not work in every state.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8

A932B7BEAC6A,"Extracurricular activities can be fun for some students, but when kids have to do these activities it can take away the fun of the activities. I disagree that students should have to do a extracurricular activity. Some kids don't participate in activities after school simply because the school may not offer a activity that they want to do. When students are forced to do these activities it can make them feel like they are doing the activities because they have to rather than because they want to. Students should not have to participate in after school activities because they take away students time, working parents can't pick kids up and it may be boring to some students.

Some parents can't pick their kid up after school because of work and therefore they can't do after school activities. Carpooling may be a option, but all parents are different and some may not want their kid to do that. Making students participate in these activities could make parents stress about the safety of their children getting home. Extracurricular activities may also have events such as games and meets that a parent may not be able to go to because of work. Finally not having a parent at a game can make a kid feel discouraged and sad.

When you have a long day at school all you want to do is go home and relax. Going home is the highlight of many kids days, but when you have a extracurricular activity you can't go home at your normal time. Students can be swamped with homework and a extracurricular activity can make a student forget that they even have homework. This can cause students to have bad grades and have bad moods. Finally extracurricular activities can make you feel stressed out because when you get home you might not have enough time to get stuff done such as chores and projects.

Some students may not be in a extracurricular activity because the school simply does not have one that interests them. If you make students choose an activity then they can be bored out of their mind. Since students are bored they probably will not participate as much and things will not get done as productively. Since stuff is not getting done properly that may not be fair to the students that actually want to be there. Finally some students may even skip their activities because they don't want to be there.

If you make students do extracurricular activities then things will go undone, parents will not be able to afford the activities and it takes away a kids time. If you make kids do extracurricular activities then you may as well add a extra hour to the school day just for them. If a student had a interest in a activity they would probably already be doing it. While there may be benefits to doing extracurricular activities the negatives far out way the positives. Just do everyone a favor and let the kids have a choice in whether they want to do the extracurricular activities or not. ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

Do you think it would be fare for students to participate in any sports or activities with a C average? Hmm! Well i think it is fare. Therefore, i believe students should be able to participate in any sports or activities because its healthy for them, it'll make their school much exciting, and they can get scholarships.

To begin with, playing sports is healthy for students. They'll be energetic and fell great instead of being lazy pigs just sitting around in their house while they can be out here in school playing sports. Also, they can become more muscular by playing sports or any other activity and they'll be in great shape. When students don't play sports they start to weaken out and aren't in good shape because their bodies aren't moving around as much. So TEACHER_NAME would you want one of your students getting sick by not playing sports or any other activity because of their grades in school?

I think we should go with Policy 1 . It says that students should bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I know that most of student will also agree with the policy too because even if you say don't bring phones to school most students still will. Another reason that we should go with policy 1 is because when your leaving school what if your walking on the street and someone came and took something from you while you was walking with it. It wont be that big of a problem because gladly you will have your cell phone with you and you can call someone for help. Another reason is what if something happen to you and your cell phone happens to fall out your pocket then if someone generous pass you then they will take your cell phone and see if you have your parent number there or call the cops.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinchi studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convery specific emotions. His new computer software stores smilar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da Vinci Code""! The Mona lisa demonstation is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad.

E56D7CC27444,"Hey, so for this essay, I gotta talk about how praising someone's work can help them build self-esteem, even if they didn't put in a lot of effort. Some people think it's a good idea because it makes them feel good about themselves and their abilities. Like, if someone gets an A on a test and their teacher is all like ""Great job! You're so smart!"" They might feel like they can do anything.

But, I don't know, I think it can also be bad to only focus on the end result and not the effort that went into it. Like, if someone gets an A on a test but they didn't actually study that much, they might not feel as good about themselves as they would if they had put in the effort and gotten a lower grade but knew they deserved it. It's like, if you only focus on the outcome and not the process, you might not learn anything from it.

And also, if everyone keeps praising someone for something they didn't really do, they might start to feel like they're not actually good at anything. Like, if someone always gets praised for their grades but they're not actually that smart, they might start to think they're not good at anything else either. It's like, they're only good at one thing and that's not really enough.

So, I think it's important to find a balance between praising someone's work and also acknowledging the effort they put into it. That way, they can feel good about themselves without getting too caught up in the end result. And also, they might be more likely to put in the effort next time if they know their hard work will be recognized.

These accomplishments have come in various forms, including scientific discoveries, artistic creations, and political movements. In this essay, I will analyze the impact of three notable figures and their accomplishments on the world, and how they can benefit the present and future.

Firstly, Albert Einstein is a well-known physicist who is famous for his theory of relativity. This theory revolutionized the way we understand the universe and led to numerous advancements in science and technology. Einstein's work has had a significant impact on the world, as it has led to the development of modern technology such as GPS, nuclear power, and even the internet. These advancements have greatly improved our quality of life and have allowed us to achieve things that were once thought impossible. In the future, Einstein's work will continue to inspire new generations of scientists and engineers to push the boundaries of what is possible.

Secondly, Mahatma Gandhi is a political leader who is known for his role in India's struggle for independence from British rule. Gandhi's non-violent approach to activism and his belief in the power of the people have inspired countless movements for social justice and equality around the world. His leadership and philosophy have had a lasting impact on the world, as they have shown that peaceful resistance can be an effective way to bring about change. In the future, Gandhi's legacy will continue to inspire leaders and activists to work towards a more just and equitable world.

Lastly, Leonardo da Vinci is an artist and inventor who is known for his incredible range of talents. Da Vinci's paintings, such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, are considered some of the greatest works of art in history. Additionally, his inventions, such as the flying machine and the armored car, have had a lasting impact on the world. Da Vinci's work has inspired countless artists and inventors to pursue their passions and to push the boundaries of what is possible. In the future, Da Vinci's legacy will continue to inspire creativity and innovation in all fields.

FE604F4C35DC,"The future is coming. In this modern age, we have personal assistants on our phones, holographic keyboards, and even 3D TVs. It's not that far fetched that soon we could also have self-driving cars as well. Self-driving cars are quickly becoming a reality, but they first should be tested so no hazardous glitches remain.

Recently there have been multiple breakthroughs that have advanced progress on making an actual self-driving car. One such advances was the more advanced sensors that are now put on cars. Now, these sensor help alert drivers to where a possibly dangerous situation is, but in the future they could be used as the ""eyes"" for the car. No car would be able to drive on it's own without being able to sense which direction it's going. As well there have been multiple breakthroughs with computer systems, which would give the car the know-how in order to drive on it's own. Lastly, thanks to satellite imaging, almost the entire world has been mapped out. This, added along with everything else, could really help realize the future of the self-driving car.

Now even though this idea sounds fantastic, it's not without flaws. Sometimes computers will suffer errors in their programming. Most of the time, this isn't too important, but if it happened to a self-driving car with someone in it, the results could be disasterous. The cars would need to be heavily tested to get rid of as many of these errors as possible. As well, there would also have to be a new set of laws that pretain to self-driving cars. One such law would be if a car crashed, who would be responsible, the passenger or the manufacturer?

B17A58769FF3,"Theres so many roads in the world but traffic still exists. Ever think about the amount of cars in your neighborhood?, dont you think thats probaly the reason why? In the Sources 1,2,3 , and 4 all imphasizes on how having a limit of car usage can be an great advantage to society. I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.

With that being said , Limiting car use lowers air pollution. I agree with this because the less cars driven leads to less burning fuel. According to the passage by Robert Duffer paragraph 10 states that ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""Due to the high population in Paris and numerous amount of the owning a vehicle causes massive car pollution. Having massive car pollution can be dangerous, this inherits sickness, stress and diseases. Refering to the source ""Car-free Day is spinning into a big hit in Bogata,Columbia"" Mayor Of Bogota (Antanas Mockus) stated that ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" As he rode a two seater bike with his wife. The Mayor in this content speaks the absolute truth. As you walk to your destination in the nice warm air you relive stress and diseases that were causing you to be sick before. Those are the reasons why i think limiting car usage lowers the pollution.

Additionally, Limitiing car usage decreases traffic. This is true because if there is 5 people going to the same place you are and all of you guys drive in that one car or bus that reduces the traffic. Micheal Sivak In Source 4 ( The end of car Culture) elaborates on that by saying ""What most intrgues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before downturn, I Think that means something more fundamental is going on.""What Mr. Sivak means by this is that everyone should only have a certain amount of car per household and person Which will also lower the traffic. Traffic in paris is very long but due to the car-free act traffic was reduces. from reading source 2 by Robert Duffer ,it states ""Congestion was down 60 % in the capital of france (Paris), after five days of intensifying smong."" Just in five days of no driving the air is already unpolluted imageded if you drived five days all day. Those are the reasons why i think that Limiting car usage is an advantage.

To Conclude,I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
llama_70b_v1498,"Single-use plastics have become a major controversy in recent years due to their harmful effects on the environment. While some argue that these products are convenient and necessary, others believe that a ban on single-use plastics is necessary to protect the planet. In this essay, I will argue for the ban of single-use plastics, providing reasons and examples to support my position.

One of the main reasons to ban single-use plastics is the devastating impact they have on our oceans and wildlife. Plastic bags, straws, and bottles are often not disposed of properly and end up in our oceans, where they harm marine life. Sea turtles, for example, often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them, causing blockages in their digestive system and even death. According to the World Wildlife Fund, if we don't take action to reduce plastic waste, there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050. This is a startling statistic that highlights the urgent need to reduce our use of single-use plastics.

Another reason to ban single-use plastics is the negative impact they have on the environment. Plastic products are made from non-renewable resources, such as oil and gas, which contribute to climate change. The production of plastic also releases harmful chemicals into the air and water, contributing to air pollution and water pollution. Additionally, plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose, which means that it accumulates in landfills and pollutes the environment for generations to come.

Furthermore, single-use plastics are not necessary for our daily lives. Many alternatives, such as reusable bags, water bottles, and straws, are available and can easily replace single-use plastics. For example, cotton bags can be used multiple times and are biodegradable, making them a much better option than plastic bags. Similarly, stainless steel water bottles and glass straws are affordable and can be used repeatedly, eliminating the need for single-use plastic water bottles and straws.

Finally, banning single-use plastics can have economic benefits. According to a study by the University of California, banning single-use plastics can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. The study found that the production of reusable products, such as cloth bags and stainless steel water bottles, can create new industries and employment opportunities. Additionally, the reduction in plastic waste can save cities and towns millions of dollars in waste management and cleanup costs.

In conclusion, the ban of single-use plastics is necessary to protect the environment and promote sustainability. The harmful impacts of plastic waste on our oceans and wildlife, the negative effects on the environment, the availability of alternatives, and the potential economic benefits all support a ban on single-use plastics. It is time for us to take action and make a change for the better. By banning single-use plastics, we can create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The use of single-use plastic products has become a controversial topic due to its impacts on the environment.

Technology has totally changed the way we live our lives, and it's hard to imagine a day without our phones, laptops, and tablets. But, just like anything else, technology has its pros and cons. In this essay, I'll talk about how technology affects people's lives, both positively and negatively.

First of all, technology has made our lives so much easier in terms of learning. With the internet at our fingertips, we can access a wealth of information on any topic imaginable. We can learn new things, do research, and even take online classes. It's like having a magic wand that gives us instant knowledge! 🧙‍♂️

But, on the other hand, technology can also be a distraction. Sometimes, we get so caught up in our devices that we forget to do our homework or even spend time with our families. It's like we're addicted to our screens! 😳 And, if we're not careful, we might end up spending too much time playing games or scrolling through social media, which can be really bad for our physical health.

Another thing that's changed because of technology is how we manage our time. With so many notifications and alerts, it's hard to keep track of what's important and what's not. Sometimes, we end up wasting hours of our day on things that don't really matter. It's like our brains are always on overdrive! 🤯

Lastly, technology has also changed the way we live our lives. With the rise of e-commerce and online shopping, we can buy anything we want from the comfort of our own homes. It's like having a magic store right in front of us! 🛍️ But, this can also lead to a sedentary lifestyle, where we spend most of our time sitting and not moving around.

I am writing to you today on the topic of community service. Some kids think it is a good idea, others a bad idea. Some kids think it takes up to much of their time. Others think that it is a good idea. I think that all students should be required to do at least some community service. Some kids helping in elementary school are helping kids understand what they are learning better and so they are making this community a smarter community. Others pick up litter. That helps the community keep clean and save the environment. We could have other kids sell lemonade or drinks or snack food. That could help raise money for the community to buy things for our school like playground equipment or books. Other people could help out at the library sorting books and putting the back on the shelf. That could help people get more books from the library and learn about other places around the world.

There are even more ways to do community service then what meets the eye. For people who play sports. They could organize for example a soccer game to raise money, or a swimming meet. They could practice their sports they play while helping to raise money for the community. Or if they are good at art they could draw artwork and sell it to help raise money. Community service doesn't always have to mean that people aren't having fun. So all in all, i do believe that kids should be required to do community service.

Community service can be very rewarding to a students life. Many think of it as boring or stupid, but it can have a lot of positive effects on a persons personality and social life. Community service can create, in some students, respect and responsibleness that was not acquired before. In the end, it could help them learn the skills they need for their dream profession. It also makes the student more of a possibility for scholarships to a certain college or university with service hours on their application.

Very few teenagers actually participate in community service, and most who do don't do it often. This is because most students believe that it is a waste of time and takes away from the time they could use to play video games or hang out with their friends. In my opinion, if you make the service seem fun more students will get involved. Also if they are allowed to be with someone they know or are friends with they are more than likely to want to participate in whatever community service is being performed.

8F5F3F2519DA," In today's fast-paced world, it is becoming increasingly important for students to develop the skills necessary to succeed in the future. One program that has been gaining popularity in schools is the pairing of younger students with older students. This program has many benefits for both the older and younger students, and can be an excellent choice for schools looking to improve their students' responsibilities, socialization, and behavior.

One of the main advantages of this program is the opportunity for younger students to learn from the experience and wisdom of older students. Older students have already gone through the same experiences that younger students are currently facing, and can provide valuable insights and guidance. This can help younger students feel more confident and better equipped to handle the challenges they face in school and in life.

In addition to providing valuable guidance, this program can also help older students develop important leadership and mentoring skills. By working with younger students, older students can learn how to communicate effectively, set boundaries, and manage their own responsibilities. This can be particularly beneficial for students who struggle with social skills or who have difficulty taking charge in group settings.

Another benefit of this program is the opportunity for older and younger students to work together and improve their socialization skills. By pairing students of different ages, schools can create a more inclusive and supportive environment. This can help younger students feel more comfortable talking to and interacting with older students, and can also help older students develop their communication and interpersonal skills.

Finally, this program can also have a positive impact on students' behavior. By working together, students can learn to respect and communicate with others in a polite and professional manner. This can help students develop important social and emotional skills that will serve them well in the future, both in school and in the workplace.

In conclusion, the pairing of younger students with older students can be a valuable program for schools looking to improve their students' responsibilities, socialization, and behavior. By providing valuable guidance and leadership opportunities, this program can help students develop the skills they need to succeed in the future.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

NASA is making a silicon carbide that could last for up to three weeks in such conditions that meaans eventually we will be able to visit venus and learn about how the planet turned into gas and NASA is trying to make parts that would be more resistant to venus as it states in the passage."" we are creating a system of mechanical parts tht could be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.""

You just make it look like you guys care, taking advice from the people in the states, but it's really just your decision. I want to choose freely, not think I am choosing freely. The President is a person who takes action in the country and we the people, want to choose the right one. You guys even show it sometimes. In the state, we might have a majority pick for one president, but you end up picking another one instead.

I understand that the Electoral College represents us by the number of people in the state, but there's one problem, you're not representing us well. I think that the United States shouldn't have the Electoral College and should just have a president win by the most votes. This is truly the best way to choose a president. I seriously don't like the idea about Electoral College and I think that the U.S should change that.

With cuttuing edge technology and knowledge evolving, humans have been acheiving and setting for the unthinkable. From cars traveling faster than the speed of sound, to cars that can drive themselves. Some aren't to happy with the image of that. Think, can cars really drive on their own, and what if the cars crashes who's at fault?

The idea of self driving cars scare many that maybe why it's actually illegal to even test computer-driven cars, stated in passage 9. This is because it isn't a hundred percent safe, though Google has cars that have been driven for a million miles without a crash, stated in passage 2. I think it would make a big change if cars could drive themselves. There would probably still be car accidents, but there would be as many.

Self driving cars would have many pros because there could be less texting and driving, which means less accidents. There would also be less drunk drivers which mean leass accidents, and there could also be less people dying. This would be a deal breaker for parents they could actuallly monator where their kids go. There could be less accidents among teens and in general. Kids wouldn't have to lose their life because they ran out in the street and was hitten by a car all because the child was getthing a ball.

71129FE0D18F,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Graduating from high school in three years has both benefits and drawbacks. One of the main benefits is that it can save students money on their education. By completing their high school education faster, they can skip a year of college or vocational school, which can save them thousands of dollars in tuition and fees. This can be especially helpful for students who come from low-income families and may not have the financial means to afford a traditional four-year high school experience.

Another benefit of graduating early is that it can give students a head start on their future careers. By finishing high school faster, they can enter the workforce earlier and gain valuable work experience, which can help them get ahead in their chosen field. This can be especially beneficial for students who know exactly what they want to do with their lives and want to get started as soon as possible.

However, there are also some drawbacks to graduating from high school in three years. One of the main concerns is that it may not provide students with enough time to fully develop their academic skills. High school is not just about learning facts and figures, but also about learning how to think critically and solve problems. By rushing through their education, students may not have enough time to fully develop these skills, which can make it harder for them to succeed in college or the workforce.

Another drawback is that graduating early may limit students' options for higher education. Many colleges and universities have strict requirements for incoming freshmen, and students who graduate early may not meet these requirements. This can make it harder for them to get into the school of their choice, which can be a major disappointment for students who have worked hard to get to this point.

Finally, there are also legal considerations to consider when graduating early. In some states, students who graduate early may not be eligible for certain financial aid programs or scholarships, which can make it harder for them to pay for college. This can be a major drawback for students who are relying on financial aid to help them pay for their education.

In conclusion, graduating from high school in three years has both benefits and drawbacks. While it can save students",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Examine the benefits and drawbacks of graduating from high school in three years due to legal statuses, financial concerns and pre-credit courses.",1
llama_70b_v1308,"Standardized tests have been a part of school life for as long as I can remember. But are they really a good way to measure how smart we are? I'm not so sure.

First of all, standardized tests are too narrow. They only test us on a tiny bit of what we learn in school. They don't take into account all the other important things we learn, like how to work together, how to think critically, or how to be creative. That's like trying to measure how good a movie is by only looking at one scene. It doesn't give the whole picture.

Another thing is, standardized tests are really good at finding mistakes, but not so good at finding what we know. For example, if I'm really good at math, but I accidentally add a zero to my answer, I'll get marked down even though I knew the right way to do it. That's not fair.

And don't even get me started on how stressful these tests are! We spend weeks, even months, preparing for them, and then we have to sit there for hours, trying to concentrate, while our brains are going crazy from all the pressure. That's not a healthy way to learn.

I think a better way to measure our abilities would be to have more project-based learning. That way, we can show what we know by doing real-world tasks, like creating a presentation or building a model. It's more like how life really works, and it gives us a chance to show off all the things we're good at.

In conclusion, standardized tests might seem like a good idea, but they're not the best way to measure how smart we are. They're too narrow, they're not good at finding what we know, they're too stressful, and they don't take into account all the other important things we learn in school. We should try using more project-based learning instead.

For example when kids want to join a team the coach say you cant join because your grade is too low. I believe it is right to not let kids play unless they are passing there classes. Kids are smart and they should show it, if your not passing u should go ask for some help, get advice, go to your parents and ask them to help u with homework, go home and tell your parents that your not getting what u are learning today in school.

37CD93590711,"Since the 1900's cars have been an integral part of our lives. It seems everyone has one nowadays. But this overuse of cars is starting to have a negative effect on our enviroment and is causing mass traffic jams that put cities on halt. We as a society must start limiting our car usage to help save our enviroment and to stop traffic jams that do not let the city run smoothly.

Cars were and still are one of the best inventions man has ever made, so it is understandable why people would have such a hard time letting go of something that is so useful. But one must understand that although the car is useful it is also hurting other things, whether it be inadvertant or not. Cars have always been bad on the enviroment, now so more then ever. According to

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars passenger cars are responsible for 12 % of greeenhouse emissions and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. This shows that we as a society are one the of the main reasons why are enviroment is crumbling around us. These greenhouse emissions and mass pollution by cars are hurting the enviroment whether we want it to or not. Everybody must take a look at these numbers and see the negative effect they are having on the enviroment and realize that by simply not using a car they can help save the enviroment. Another example of the bad effects cars have on the enviroment can be found in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog.

In the article it talks about how Paris had to enforce a driving ban due to the amount of pollution in the air from cars. The fact that a driving ban had to be implemented to stop pollution is absolutley ridiculous. This alone should show people that refuse to see the negative effects they are having on the enviroment around them that car usage should and must be cut down. By simply cutting down our usage of cars we as people can help save the enviroment. Who would not want to be a part of that?

Cars have always been viewed at as the best mode of transportation. Everyone believes that their car can always get them to the place they need the fastest. But what most people do not think about is the mass traffic jams in cities that the usage of cars can cause. If people simply cut down there car usage and try out other forms of transportation it actually could get them to the destination they want the quickest. An example of this can be found in the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.

In the article it says when they banned cars for the day the huge traffic jams in the city suddenly went away. This allowed people on bikes and buses to actually get around quicker than they usually could with their cars. So by not using cars people actually got around to the places they needed to be due to the lack of traffic jams in the city.

The amount of cars driven on the road per day has risen to an astronomical number over the years. Although cars may be efficient they also have many harmful effects. Two of the worst are the effect they have on the enviroment and the mass traffic jams they cause. We as a society must recognize that by cutting down our usage of cars we can actually have a positive effect on our enviroment while also allowing ourselves the ability to bring traffic jams to a minimum.

54351180CD4F,"Many have claimed that the human face found on Mars is an alien artifact, but how certain are they. According to NASA, the Face on Mars is just a rock formation that resembles the face of a human, but others may disagree. I believe that the Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. To further investiate this topic, we will begin by analyzing how the Face was formed and how it compares to lanforms on Earth, where it was located, and what causes others to believe that it is an alien artifact.

Some might believe that the so called ""alien artifact"" was lefted behind by aliens, but NASA unveiled an image of the Face and this is what they came up with. According to the caption of the image, it noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, annd mouth."" This image was even compared to natural landforms found on Earth. According to the passage, the picture portrays the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. The passage also claims that the image reminds him of the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" and that the Face on Mars is about he same height of an isolated mesa- which is a landform.

The Face on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian latitude during the winter of April 1998. This time of the year was also considered to be the cloudiest time of year on the Red Planet. The fact that this image was found during the cloudiest time of year on Mars can affect the turn out of this theory. A few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, and photographing the Cydonia became one of the biggest priorities for NASA. As soon as the Viking mission was ended, the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated that they ""photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it."" I believe they did this to clarify their foundings.

As stated before, many people, including scientists, believe that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact and here are their reasons why. As the photo of the Face on Mars was being taken, it was claimed that the ""camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face,"" and according to skeptics, ""alien markings were hidden by haze."" This did not stop mission controllers, and they prepared to look again. Garvin states that "" It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" and that its hardwork. Conspiracy theorists believe that the Face is ""bona-fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide."" Now this may all sound convincing, but it was also added that you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, causing false illusions.

In conlusion, after analyizing the data and research given, I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Others may disagree, but it is all about your interprutation on the topic, and hopefully the evidence used to support my claims did just that.        ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
F57B95D17755," It's not uncommon for older and younger students to be in the same program, but it can be challenging for both groups. While the younger students may be excited to learn from their older peers, the older students may not always be interested in teaching or mentoring them. This can lead to a disconnect between the two groups, with the younger students feeling overwhelmed by the older students' expectations and the older students feeling like they are not being challenged enough.

One solution to this problem could be to create separate programs for older and younger students. This would allow each group to focus on their own learning and development, without the pressure of having to teach or learn from the other. This would also give the older students the opportunity to learn more about the younger students' needs and interests, and the younger students the chance to learn from their peers who are closer in age.

Another solution could be to create more structured opportunities for older and younger students to interact, such as buddy systems or mentorship programs. This would allow the older students to take on a more active role in teaching and guiding the younger students, while also providing a more supportive and structured environment for the younger students to learn and grow.

Ultimately, the decision to allow older and younger students to be in the same program should be based on the specific needs and goals of the program. While it may not be the best solution for all situations, it can be a valuable learning experience for both groups if approached in the right way.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

Last but not least, how did the aliens make the face like that? I dont think aliens made that face because how can you posibly believe that aliens are are real? Aliens arent even real because if they were real, their head would not even be like that. Take a really good look at the photo to see who you think made the face. If you take a good look at the face you could tell that the face is made from a real human and not a alien. Where could aliens get sement from to even make the face pop out like that? I dont believe that aliens made a face like that because it is impossible for a type of species to do somehing such like that, aliens arent even real because scientist have been looking for them for a long time and they have not found one yet.

I send you this letter to let you know about the arguing that has been going on our school whether students should be required to perform community service or not. Well my opinion is that performing community should be an optional, however I think teachers should encourage students to do it. Teachers can encourage students by offering rewards such as extra-credits.

I believe this method would work on students, this way students can do better on school and help their community, all at the same time. If we were to require them, those students that say to not have time would feel as if they were obligated to work for something that does not benefit them. On the other hand if we didn't encourage them, they simply wouldn't do it.

But sometimes other people have different opinions or different perspective from that matter and might make the decision that you're making much more difficult. For example, a friend of yours can give you an opinion, but it can also give you a different perspective from that choice and make you look at it in a different way. However, getting different ideas might help better your decision or make it much easier. Another example, hearing advice from someone that is closer to you or someone that you really trust(can be more than one person)can make you feel more relaxed or make you feel more confident in your decision.

Sometimes making decisions on your own can make you a bit worried or it can make you over think/stress about it. Therefore, asking other people for advice can help you improve that and can make you more comfortable/confident about the decisions you make in the near future. It can also affect how you work with others and build a better relationship. When asking someone for help on a decision that you are having worries about, hearing other people's opinions/advice can affect on how you communicate with that person.

If you feel comfortable talking with someone or communicate with someone that makes you feel confident on the choice that you are making, it can help/make you rely on them a bit more. As in from their perspective, it can make them rely on you and might ask you for advice in the near future. When helping each other on something that both of you are having trouble with, talking to each other will help you guys feel more secure about your decision and can grow and build the way you both communicate with each other and others. Getting different opinions from other people isn't a bad thing, it most likely won't make the choice more harder. It might actually help you on how to make decisions on your own in the future. As some people say, having a great relationship with someone or just having good people around you can really affect you as a person and can help you improve yourself for the better. For example, having good influences around you can help the way you think or communicate with others. Having someone to help you out can affect you and your decisions in many ways, of course it might change some things but it might change for the better.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

In todays society is a key element on being able to read people's emotion to be able to determine how to approach the said person.

The use of the software could help teachers understand their students,which in turn can help elaborate people's triggers and can lead to a better day.""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day.

For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions.

His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huangs emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vinci Code)""

A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressivefor video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang. So computers need to understand that, too.Eckman has classified six basic emotionshappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnessand then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when youre surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

In 1976 the Viking 1 sent a picture of a supposed face. NASA, shortly after getting the image, then made a false testimony stateing that an alien carved face is on Mars. The now famous image of Mars took a name The Face. Now twenty-two years later NASA tries again at a picture of The Face. The picture turns out good, but a cloud blocks a part of the image. The people aren't happy and they get NASA, three years later to get another picture, and it it shows no evidence of an alien carved face. The talk of The Face soon dies down.

Most at the NASA space station argue that the face is in fact a true natural landform. The face would be considered a natural landform because there isn't actual proof that aliens had created the landform. This statement meaning that there isn't, for example, video footage proof of the landform being created by aliens, which could have been something that could prove that the face is either natural or unnatural. Another reason why this face could be a natural landform is that no one has actually lived on Mars, so no one could stand up and say whether or not it's natural. For the face to be natural, Mars itself would've had to go through natural causes such as erosion or a quake for the face to be created.

On the other hand, it's easy to see why people would think that the face was created by aliens. In the history of the world, many peculiar events have happened where nobody knew how they happened. For example, all over the Earth, there have been cases of weird patterns appearing in corn fields and mazes. People would say that the patterns were created by aliens, so many just say that weird occurences are due to weird, foreign beings: Aliens. Furthermore, another reason why people would think that the face was created by aliens that ties into the other side of the argument is that since no human being has lived on Mars, there is no factual evidence that states that the face was created by natural causes or by aliens; but since aliens live on Mars and other planets in space, people are forced to make the conclusion that aliens made them.

In conclusion, some people don't even have an opinion and they just believe the scientific evidence over the belief that aliens had created them. People might believe this evidence because some people, in fact, don't even believe in aliens at all. But the face could very well be a natural landform due to natural causes such as erosion of the planet or quakes in Mars that formed the face. Or if there are aliens on Mars, the face-according to some people- could've also been created by aliens that lived on Mars. But according to the scientists and chiefs at NASA, the Mars Exploration Program, and other space stations involved in the Viking 1 and Viking 2 space mission, the face on Mars was only created by natural occurrences and they try to get people to believe it by plastering it all over Hollywood movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines.

D60F86CE307A,"Today, most students attend public and private schools; however, there are a small amount of students who attend online school at home. Online school is often used for those with large commitments such as, sports and the arts. Sometimes parents enroll their children into online school just because they want to. However, students would not benefit from attending classes from home because it limits their social skills, influences procrastination, and the opportunity to cheat on assignments.

When classes are being taken online, students are isolated from others making it harder for them to practice their social skills. This does not benefit them in any type of way; especially, if the student doesn't do any activities outside of the house. Social skills are important in the real world because they help people find jobs and survive in society. In order to receive a job, a person has to talk to the interviewer and if they're nervous, then they don't receive the job. Without social skills students are not benefiting from taking online classes.

Not only will students lack social skills, but they will begin to procrastinate. Students are more likely to procrastinate at home because they have unlimited access to their phones and video games. Today, some students who attend public and private schools already procrastinate enough when they are at home, and with the luxury of being at home all the time, this will easily take into effect. Due to the fact that these students are always home, they will continuously procrastinate because they have the ability to cheat using the internet. With this in their mind, they will create this continuous cycle of procrasination and cheating.

Leading into the next point, online school is not beneficial because it makes students believe that they can cheat. Since students who are taking online school are already using technology, it makes it easier to cheat. They have easy access to search engines such as, Google and Bing; making it easy to search up answers for their assignments. Students also have the ability to communicate with others taking the same class as them, and allowing them to exchange answers. When students cheat it does not benefit them in one way or another.

Some may say that parents set up restrictions against their students, but most parents are busy with work or running errands.

Attending online class is not beneficial to students. This is because it makes them to be socially awkward , which will lead to giving up job; procrastinating and play video games all day; and cheating on every assignment they and not learn anything. if you think about attending online classes, think about how much your work ethic may be.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
A72F4E50ED92,"Working with group is more beneficial because, if a person work in group then he/she can share thought and ideas before start working. Also, it helps student to learn how to communicate with other team member because team work is very important and necessary to learn before students start working professionally.

I believe that working in group will gives student more ideas and everyone in group can share their thoughts with each other. It also helps students to finish their work on time and the most important is that not only one person have burden to do all work. Communication is the key of working in group because, group working is also helps students to learn how to communicate and how people should behave when they work as a team.

Team work and communication is very important to learn before a person go to college or before start working professionally because, if a person does not have ability to work in team then it would be very hard to adjust in college or professional work environment. There are many advantages of working in group for instance, student can plan and share ideas with their group, they can discuss the work with each other before the start work on any project and they can also help each other if any of the group member is confused in anything. The most important part of the any project or any other work is finish on time and if not then no matter how much hard work the person put is just useless. Group working is also save time because everyone work together rather then only one person has burden to complete all work.

To conclude, I just want to mention that I understand that working alone is more beneficial for some people but, working in group is much better more easier than working alone.

llama_70b_v1485,"In recent years, there has been a growing trend of incorporating meditation and mindfulness practices into the daily routine of schools. While some argue that these practices have numerous benefits for students, others believe that they have no place in the school curriculum. In this essay, I will argue for the inclusion of meditation and mindfulness practices in schools, providing reasons and examples to support my position.

First and foremost, meditation and mindfulness practices have been shown to have a positive impact on students' mental health and well-being. Studies have shown that regular meditation can reduce stress and anxiety levels, improve mood, and even reduce symptoms of depression. In today's fast-paced world, where students are constantly bombarded with social media, homework, and extracurricular activities, it is no surprise that mental health has become a major concern. By incorporating meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day, students can learn how to manage their emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.

Another benefit of meditation and mindfulness practices is that they can improve students' focus and concentration. Mindfulness practices, such as deep breathing and body scan, can help students become more aware of their thoughts and emotions, allowing them to better regulate their attention and focus on the task at hand. This can lead to improved academic performance, as students are able to stay on task and retain information more effectively.

In addition, meditation and mindfulness practices can foster a sense of community and social-emotional learning in schools. By practicing together, students can develop a sense of connection and empathy towards their peers, promoting a positive and supportive school culture. This can lead to improved social skills, conflict resolution, and teamwork, all of which are essential for success in both personal and professional life.

Moreover, meditation and mindfulness practices can be adapted to fit the diverse needs and interests of students. For example, some schools have incorporated mindfulness into their physical education classes, using activities such as yoga and tai chi to promote physical and mental well-being. Others have created meditation clubs, where students can come together to practice and discuss their experiences. This flexibility allows schools to tailor their mindfulness practices to the unique needs and preferences of their students, making it accessible and enjoyable for all.

Despite these benefits, some argue that meditation and mindfulness practices have no place in schools. They claim that these practices are too ""hippie"" or ""new-agey,"" and that they detract from the academic focus of schools. However, I believe that this view is short-sighted and neglects the numerous benefits that meditation and mindfulness practices can provide.

In conclusion, the inclusion of meditation and mindfulness practices in schools is a valuable asset that can promote mental health, focus, and social-emotional learning. By incorporating these practices into the daily routine, schools can provide students with the tools they need to succeed in both personal and professional life. While some may argue that these practices have no place in schools, I firmly believe that they are an essential component of a well-rounded education.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Some schools have implemented meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day.

The world has seen the ""Face"" taken by NASA a few years ago. Some people say it's a natural landform and some people say it's an alien creation. NASA has figured out that it's just a natural landform on Mars and nothing else. NASA haven't explored all of Mars and can state it's an alien creation, there might be more than just one and they all could be natural landforms. It might look like a really weird face from above, but NASA has already stated that it's a natural landform.

NASA has explored a lot of Mars, but not enough information to say it's an alien creation. They've just found one and it looks pretty like a huge face to some people. They might find more out there just like this and it's still and ordinary landform. On Earth there are a lot of these landforms around the American West. NASA has taken a picture in really high-quality camera to show that it's just a natural lanform there.

Before Amercia had these great cameras and computers, they weren't able to get a clear picture of the face. So people just assumed that it was an alien creation/monument. If they say it is where are the facts that say it's an alien monument. Later after all those years, NASA were able to take a maxium resolution picture and post it to the world. Thousands of people were waiting to see the photo, but when they did it was just a natural landform. There was no alien creation to see and observe at.

Although NASA has said it's just a natural landform, people state that sometimes NASA doesn't want us to know certain things. Some people say it could've been a monument created by an alien civilization on Mars. They haven't gone through all of Mars and know that was there or not. NASA might eventually find more of these landforms and study to actually say it's an alien creation. Conspiracy theorists state that the face is bona fide evidence and that NASA would hide them from us. The world doesn't know what's out there to say that it's this or it's that.

Since, NASA people say that it's a natural landform, people believe them. The ""face"" is nothing else than a landform on Mars, it's known to find some of these landforms around the American West. NASA has aready proven that it's just an ordinary lanform with a maximum resolution camera and posted it to the world to see. NASA has hid a lot of stuff from us and right now in this situation, people believe that they're lying to the U.S. Some people believe in NASA, some people in conspiracy theorists, but who knows what that ""face"" is.

BF5D1465DFFC,"quote ""A problem is a chance to do your best"" impacts people.

Duke Ellington, a legendary jazz musician and composer, once said, ""A problem is a chance to do your best."" This quote has had a profound impact on people across various fields and walks of life, inspiring them to view challenges as opportunities for growth and improvement.

One way in which this quote has impacted people is by encouraging them to embrace challenges and view them as opportunities for personal and professional growth. By reframing problems as chances to do their best, people are motivated to put forth their best efforts and overcome obstacles. This mindset has been particularly useful in sports, where athletes often face setbacks and injuries that can derail their careers. For example, when I was on the track team in high school, I suffered a severe sprain that threatened to end my season. However, I took Ellington's quote to heart and used it as motivation to work hard in rehab and come back stronger than ever. Through perseverance and dedication, I was able to recover and return to the track, ultimately earning a spot on the varsity team.

In school, Ellington's quote has helped me to approach challenges with a positive mindset and a growth mindset. Rather than viewing difficult assignments or exams as insurmountable obstacles, I now see them as opportunities to learn and improve. This has helped me to perform better academically and develop a love for learning. For instance, when I struggled with a particularly challenging math problem, I used Ellington's quote to remind myself that the problem was just a chance to do my best. I spent extra time studying and practicing, and eventually, I was able to solve the problem and move on to the next challenge.

Ellington's quote has also had a significant impact on my family. When faced with difficult situations or conflicts, I have used his quote to encourage my family members to view the problem as an opportunity to grow and improve. By reframing the situation as a chance to do their best, we have been able to work together to find solutions and overcome challenges. For example, when my siblings and I disagreed about a family decision, I used Ellington's quote to remind them that the problem was just a chance to do their best.

Not only do these people have positive attitudes to drive them, but they have also learned to stay committed to their goals, no matter how difficult or lengthy the journey may be. 

Grades, school, and homework are also crucial elements in the pursuit of success. Individuals who have reached success in their lives often attribute this success to having done well in school and having put in hard work and dedication to their studies. They internalized their motivation to do better, working hard to acheive academic excellence. 

This proves that attitude and commitment play a major role in success. Having a positive outlook can also inspire others to strive for their own goals.

Throughout our lives, as we experience the highs and lows of life, wisdom and experience from those who have gone before us can be invaluable.

For the younger generation, the guidance of a parent or guardian can help them make wise decisions, especially during times of adversity. With practical wisdom and life experience, these mentors can help advise through difficult decisions—from the small but significant ones in teenage life such as career choices, to the bigger life decisions such as sorting out relationships and financial management.

Finally, as children become adults, having someone with experience to act as a sounding board to discuss career opportunities, sports, social situations, and relationships, can be key to making wise choices. A parent or guardian who is wise and experienced can help a young adult tap into their strengths and teach them how to find and develop wisdom.

0F7862191BC4,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I just heard of your plan to make community service required by all students at SCHOOL_NAME. I just thought I'd let you know, I think that's an amazing idea! However, I would consider revising it a bit. I advocate any form of community service. I believe it builds character while helping other people in need. We take too much for granted any way. Helping other people in need is a good way to make us more appreciative of what we have, and perhaps even help us use these things we take for granted in moderation.

Now that you know my stance on community service, you will better understand my ideas on this plan of yours. First of all, community service would have to be done outside of school, and it's rather impractical to give it as homework. This is because some kids don't have transportation to places they can do community service. We also need to focus on our school work.

So, we could start making our Environmental Club more serious. By that, I mean that it would have a bigger place in our school, enough to where other schools would even hear about it. We can do more community service in the club, and show the other students what we did, encouraging them to join. You could also have a school assembly to inform the students of the benefits of doing community service. Besides helping other people, having community service hours on your resume is a monumental help in getting a job or getting into a good college. And helping other people helps us become better people, morally.

Keeping what I have told you in mind, what would be the best solution? Overall, the best thing we can do is encourage the students to join the Environmental Club, and inform them of the benefits of community service. And if we accomplish bigger and bigger jobs, then we could even get publicity in the newspaper. This way, readers would be inspired to go out and help others. Please reflect on my ideas, and seriously consider taking action.

Have you ever stopped to consider how many of the technological advancements we enjoy today were made possible by a person's imagination? From the first lightbulb to the invention of the internet, it all started with a vision for a better way of life.

It is true that knowledge is essential, but without imagination, we would not be able to apply it in practical ways. Imagination is the spark that ignites the flame of innovation, allowing us to think outside the box and come up with new solutions to everyday problems. Without imagination, we would still be using candles for light and relying on horses for transportation.

Imagination is the key to unlocking our full potential as individuals and as a society. It allows us to dream big and achieve greatness. For example, without imagination, we would not have cars, smartphones, or even books. These innovations have revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate.

It is important to remember that imagination is not just about dreaming up new ideas; it is also about having the courage to pursue them. Without imagination, we would not have the drive to push the boundaries of what is possible. We would still be stuck in the same old ways of doing things, never advancing or improving.

In conclusion, imagination is a vital component of human progress. It is the spark that drives innovation and allows us to achieve greatness.

Could a computer become the next version of a mood ring?

In schools students are either eager to learne or aren't. For example in an English class a teacher is able to tell which students like the subject and those who don't.

Similarly, when I see others going through a tough time, I try to be there for them and help them see the bright side of things.

People are different, and they express their positivity in different ways. Some may be excited about the day ahead, while others may be more laid-back and take things as they come. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique way of dealing with challenges and that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to positivity.

On the other hand, some people may be excited to start the day with a fresh mind and a clear plan.

It is said that ""this year voters are to expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again loose the presidency."" Under the Electoral College System, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. Because of this there are so many questions asked that are answered very broadly due to the fact you do not really know the correct answer. For instance, who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding the public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, Sometimes the State Party's central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves.

29BE597866EE,"Dear Principal of SCHOOL_NAME,

Community service is a really great thing to do in life. Most people in this community are in need of help. Helping the community makes the world a better planet to live on. It is really easy helping them too. For example, things you can do to help the community is to go to the hospital, babysit, and visit the sick to volunteer. By volunteering, you are supposed to help people out by working for them for a couple hours a day. I require all the kids in in school to be required to do it.

When you go to the hospital, you can help the community out because in some hospitals there are people that live there because they are too old to take care of or they have some kind of mental disability or illness. The people there are usually just old with some sort of sickness. It is hard for them to be able to do actions we are doing because they don't really have enough strength to do actions us, children and teenagers can do. It is good to help out because you can change there life in a better way.

When you babysit, you can really have fun with the kids you are with. You can see and learn everything about a kid. Most of them are very fun to play with however, there are a few that give you a hard time taking care of them. Parents usually ask you to babysit sometimes because of the work times they have or when they have to go to a party together. If you really enjoy being with kids, this is something to do.

When you visit the sick, you can really help them turn a frown upside down. By this quote I mean that they are all usually sick and in pain most of the time. They really don't like having to deal with the fact that they can't do what cured people can do. You can also talk to them and tell them about your life and learn a little bit of there's. They always like having someone to talk to.

In my opinion, I think volunteering is a brilliant idea to do. i think it's a good idea because you can change a life and you can make the planet a bigger and better place to live in. This is why I require all the kids in this school to be required to do community service.

llama_70b_v1122,"Hi, my name is Bobby and I am in grade 8. Today I am going to talk about gun control. This is a big issue in many countries. Some people think we should have stricter gun control laws, while others think we should not. I think we should have stricter gun control laws.

First of all, guns are dangerous. They can hurt people and even kill them. If people have access to guns, they might use them to hurt others. For example, there have been many school shootings in the United States. These shootings have killed and hurt many students and teachers. If there were stricter gun control laws, it would be harder for people to get their hands on guns and do these horrible things.

Second, guns can also be used for suicide. Some people who are feeling sad or hopeless might use a gun to end their life. If there were stricter gun control laws, it would be harder for people to get guns and use them for suicide.

Finally, guns can also be used for crime. Criminals might use guns to rob banks or store. If there were stricter gun control laws, it would be harder for criminals to get guns and do these things.

I know some people think that stricter gun control laws would take away our freedom. They think that we should be able to own guns if we want to. But I think it is more important to keep people safe. We can still own guns, but we should have to go through a strict process to get them. This would help make sure that only safe and responsible people have guns.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws would make us safer. It would make it harder for people to use guns to hurt others, commit suicide, or commit crime. We should have stricter gun control laws to keep people safe.

---

As a grade 8 student, Bobby demonstrates some understanding of the issue of gun control and provides some reasons to support stricter gun control laws. However, the essay could benefit from more depth and nuance in terms of argumentation and evidence. Here are some suggestions for improvement:

1. Provide more specific examples: While Bobby mentions school shootings in the United States, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of how stricter gun control laws have helped to reduce gun violence in other countries or jurisdictions.
2. Address counterarguments: Bobby acknowledges that some people think stricter gun control laws would take away their freedom, but he could have addressed this counterargument more thoroughly. For example, he could have discussed how stricter gun control laws do not necessarily mean a complete ban on gun ownership, but rather a more careful process for ensuring that only responsible individuals have access to firearms.
3. Use data and statistics: To strengthen his argument, Bobby could have used data and statistics to demonstrate the effectiveness of stricter gun control laws in reducing gun violence. For example, he could have cited studies that show a correlation between stricter gun control laws and lower rates of gun violence.
4. Clarify the definition of ""stricter gun control laws"": Bobby's essay assumes that the reader knows what he means by ""stricter gun control laws,"" but it would be helpful to provide a clear definition of what this term means. For example, he could have explained that stricter gun control laws might include universal background checks, waiting periods, or limits on the types of firearms that can be owned.
5. Organize the essay: The essay jumps around a bit between different topics (school shootings, suicide, crime). It would be more effective to focus on one or two main points and develop them thoroughly, rather than trying to cover too many different issues in a short essay.

Overall, Bobby's essay demonstrates some understanding of the issue of gun control, but could benefit from more depth, nuance, and organization to make a stronger argument.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The issue of gun control is a highly contentious one in many countries.

73234AB62383,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that staying in school for two extra hours can be challenging for some students. While it is important for students to attend school and complete their assignments, there are situations where they may not have the time or energy to stay for two additional hours. In this essay, I will explore some of these situations and how they can affect students.

One situation where students may not have the time to stay in school for two extra hours is when they have a part-time job. Many students work part-time to earn money for their families or to save up for college. If they have to work after school, they may not have the time to stay for two additional hours. This can lead to stress and fatigue, as they may feel overwhelmed with their academic workload and their job responsibilities.

Another situation where students may not have the energy to stay in school for two extra hours is when they have a medical condition. Some students may have a chronic illness or disability that affects their energy levels. If they have to stay in school for two additional hours, they may feel exhausted and struggle to focus on their work. This can lead to a decline in their academic performance and their overall well-being.

Finally, some students may not have the resources to stay in school for two extra hours. For example, if they live in a low-income household, they may not have access to transportation or a quiet place to study. If they have to stay in school for two additional hours, they may feel frustrated and discouraged, as they may not have the support they need to succeed academically.

In conclusion, there are several situations where students may not have the time or energy to stay in school for two extra hours. These situations can have a negative impact on their academic performance and their overall well-being. It is important for educators and parents to be aware of these situations and to provide support and accommodations to help students succeed academically and personally.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,6
ABFEE879153D,"I believe that graduating high school in three years is the best option out there, the reason why i support this statement is because, i myself i'm graduating early the reason why i decided to this was because, i felt like i was too mature for highschool and i felt like i could do more things that highscool will limit me from doing. So many students see high school as an embergo, high school literally takes four years that alot of time, we could be out there gaining expreinces from being in the workforce and actually studying what we want to do, i also feel like highschool don't really focus on what the students actually want to do, we take classes that we won't even need after high school. Ok let look at it this way, when we take history classes in highschool are kids really going to remember what was George Washington favorite food? or when did the civil war began? yes i know it can be important for us to know our history but we should'nt be taking it for four years non-stop. For example let take a look at bill gates he was a smart kid in highschool, he also use to sneak to the college libary to do his work, because he felt like high school didn't offer him the amount of knowledge he needed so he decided to drop out of high school, and has you can see his on of the top billionairs in the World. What if there is a kid like that in highschool and he/she felt like highschool is not giving him the amount of knowledge he needed and he wants to graduate early but he can't do that because, were required to take four years of everything, and it's totally not fair. When i decided to graduate early, both my counselors and teachers where discouraging me that i should'nt do it, that colleges frown at those type of stuff and all that, but they did'nt know that i already made up my mind and i felt like i was ready to take on the world all by myself without the help of my parents. In conclusion i think three years of highschool should be encouraged alot in highschool, so kids can go out there and explore and live their dreams and actually study what they want to study. And they should'nt really make students take boring courses like history for four years of high shool non stop. I'm very happy to say that i'm class of 2020!! instead of 2021, And i'm very happy that i took that road.",0,original_moth,"Task:

DCEFAC68750A,"Schools all across the nation are requiring students to complete projects over summer break. Research shows that these assignments are extremely helpful to a students learning power. Although there are benefits for completing these summer projects, students and teachers are conflicted with one major underlying issue. Should teachers design the assignments, or students?

From personal experience, teachers should definitely design summer projects for students. When I was in the seventh grade, my science teacher gave us a project to complete over the summer, but there was no strict topic on the assignment. Our teacher told us, ""complete this project over summer break and be sure to come up with a creative design for your assignment."" Given these vague directions, students created poorly structured projects that included little, to the very least of science material within their work. Why were their projects created so poorly? It is simple, over summer break the last thing on a students mind is school work, but when assigned a project that allows the student to design it however they desire, their work will inevitably lead to a disaster.

A recent study showed that students who were assigned a project that was designed by a teacher increased the likelihood of having higher grades when the next school year started. The logical reasoning behind this conclusion is because teachers know what topics the students should focus on over break. Teacher designed projects challenge a students intelligence by enabling them to put in time and effort into their work rather than putting in little to no dedication at all. For example, if an individual was given a teacher designed project about pollution and how it affects our world, the student would be required to put in as much effort possible into the specific topic that is assigned, rather than creating a sorry topic of their own.

Given this information, hopefully schools all across the nation will continue to assign teacher designed projects over the summer. By doing so, it is certain students will learn more, be more attentive on a specific topic, and enable them to do their absolute best on any future assignment. Please take the time to share this issue with as many individuals as you can to fight against this growing problem. ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
946D8B23ECA6,"I agree with Albert Einstein when he said that imagination is more important than knowledge. within you knowledge comes you imagination. in that imagination you see that it will help you receive your knowledge from somewhere that you did imagined. even tho sometime you imagination can mess your Brain a little when you go ahead of yourself. Like when you think about a subject that takes you way over that your brain wont handle itself.

but mabey sometimes your knowledge can be more efficient than your imagination because your brain is acting more mature when it comes to obstacles that are difficult. your brain acts more when its come to a problem like that time you got stuck on that question on that math test you've taken. sometime even when you are reading a book. reading a book may help you vocabulary when you read.

but there're time when they both help each other. both knowledge and imagination can help when you construct something. mabey you wanted to built something but you had no idea what. thats why you have you imagination comes right on in to tell you many ideas on what to build. once you think of the build you knowledge is there to help out to figure out on how you should build it. your brain get all the knowledge to help to build that dimension of the building there s how both can work together,

but still there're some negative times when it come to imagination and knowledge. like that time you are felling a bit down and your imagination said that you cant find anything to make you happy. sometime when your imagination goes a bit to far like that time you play with friends when you were younger you can make thing a bit unfair with your imagination and can loose that friend. in middle school with that knowledge of yours can change many things on a test. you can do good or bad. but say you did good and you were the student that had the highest score but you friend go one of the lowest score but you bragged about it yo can also loose that friend.

imagen if a 16 year old boy wanted a job. he may have not be the smartest but he has a few bad grades. either he will get a get a good job or he'll stay jobless cause if how much knowledge he had since he does no study hard enough. so other students may have better knowledge and have received the job they have wanted. mabey t he 16 year old boy needed the job to pay for food but he had to ask all his friend to buy food since he had no ob nor the money. so in the future he became homeless because he had to pay the money back to the friends he had cause he needed money.

young children have the most imagination since they have nothing to expect. but at night children think they see monster are on closets and want to have their mom and dad to come see it for themselves but their parents say that there are no monsters. later the night they start hearing noises but cant tell were its coming from so they scream mom dad again because the child thought there was still a monster in the room. but the parents still say that there are still no monster in the room. later on the child starts to think that there it still a monster so the child went on outside the room and notice that it was no monster it was just their parent just making noise just to scare their child just for fun.",0,original_moth,"Task:

034F335E1B82,"Often times when people need advice, they'll turn to the person they trust most. While this is a good way to get someone elses feedback on a topic, it is best that they turns to more than one person. Advice can have a great impact on the way things are handled and carried out. It often effects how something is done and how it turns out in the end. Therefore, it is important to receive more than one persons' advice because the person can learn from what others have done, have more of a variety of opinions to pick from, and make their own decisions in a situation.

To start off with, learning from what others have done in the past is important. When someone asks more than one person for their advice on a certain situation, they can hear about the different outcomes, such as what to do and what not to do. For an example, if someone was asked for advice about a dating problem, the person being asked, who has dated in the past, can give more precise and trustworthy advice than someone who has never dated before. Hearing more than one persons' opinion on a topic can surely make an outcome better if the right person is asked. It is important that the person looking for feedback knows who's had the same experience before so they can receive more proper feedback.

While an individual hears about what others have done, they can decide on what piece of advice they want to take. When the person hears about what others have done in the same situation they're in, they will hear all kinds of different solutions to the problem. While there will be advice that will be their first choice, there will be some feedback that may not even be overlooked. It's important for the person to hear more than one persons' advice if they dont agree with the one way of solving the issue they were told. Having a variety of options to pick from is a great way for the person to make their own decisions and solve the problem.

Speaking of deciding, having more than one persons' advice can let the individual decide on which piece they want to use in their problem. To explain it more in depth, going by only one person's opinion on the matter can lead to a horrible accident, especially if the person felt that the advice wasn't good to take in the first place. But if the person were to have several opinions to reference off of, then they could pick the advice they believed was most suitable for the situation and carry out with it, which could leads to a better resolution. Having options when it comes to advice is the best way to decide what is the better option for the situation. Being given the option to pick from several different pieces of feedback can lead the person to a better solution than some other advice.

Overall, the best option is to ask several people for feedback rather than one. Having multiple sources is often the best way to decide what to do and settle out a situation. Often enough, only receiving one persons' advice can actually make the situation worse than it was to begin with. So while taking one person's advice is good, having several opinions is better for the person. With the person learning for other peoples' mistakes, having a variety of feedback to pick from, and deciding how to figure out the problem, they are likely to settle out the issue without a hassle.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
4DBDC14F77BA,"Dear Principal,

I do not think it would be fair to all of the football players, if you made it so that they would have to be a B average student to play. One reason why I think this is because without all of our good players, we would suffer badly. Also, it wouldn't be fair to other players. Lastly, these students wouldn't be allowed to play their favorite sport, and may resort to violence.

I think that if you made it so that every football player needed to have a B average, or better to play football our football team would do very bad. We need some of these players to play. Without them, we may lose our record of the most wins, or most championships won. Our other players like to have these players around because it gives them confidence when they are playing, and it sometimes inspires them to do better or practice more. These players can sometimes help people get active. Also, all of the other players would just get battered when they went to play the games. That is one reason why I think that you should not make it so that you had to have a B average or better to play football.

Another reason why I think this is a bad idea is because it wouldn't be fair to the other players. This sudden drop in players would make them have to pick up the pace. They may overwork themselves, and have something bad happen to them. Also, more players would have to play more than one position, and get stressed. Another scenario that might happen is that, all of the extra practicing may cause the normally B average students from doing their work, and their grades would also suffer. That is another reason why I think that the principle should not make it so that football players need to have a B average, or better, to play.

Lastly, I think that all students should be able to play football because, the players that can't play may resort to violence. These students may not be able to run off their stress, and take it out on someone else, or something else. Also, the students may become more disruptive in class, which could lead to an expulsion, or two, which would not look good for the school. The player who couldn't play may also do something criminal to take out his anger, and end up in jail. As you can tell, it would be very good it you don't change the rules about who can play football.

In conclusion, I don't think that the principal should change the rules on who should/shouldn't play football. One reason why I think this is because, our team's record would suffer. Also, it wouldn't be fair to the other players. Lastly, the students may resort to violence.

Please principal, do not make it this way, let everyone who wants to play football be able to play, no matter what their grade is. The whole school district would like it if you kept the old rules up, and not make any new ones.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Community service would be a great thing for every student to be required to do.

Even though some people may think it is a pretty big time waster, helping the community is doing an act of service, which every student should be able to enjoy.

I believe that doing community service would help the community, make students feel good, and encourage good work skills.

Doing community service helps the community out tons.

People always like having a good deed be done for them.

People have jobs for each thing we could help out with, but they would LOVE for us to help them.

I mean, wouldn't you like it if somebody helped you in your job?

Doing community service is a great way to help us to feel good about the community.

The people who don't like the idea usually become pessimists who hate everything, and we wouldn't like to make students feel that way.

We should encourage students to work hard for the community.

Another upside about doing community service is that it will make students feel good and happy.

Doing service means that you're doing something good, which makes you feel good about yourself.

I think community service would help everybody - our community, our school, and the students.

Requiring each student to do community service would be a great idea, and it might make the students feel better then they have been.

Also, if we require community service for each student, it might encourage them to do even more work.

They might feel so good about their decision, that they do some more service when it's not a requirement.

It might change into a personal goal instead.

Community service will change people's lives and attitudes for the better. They will be in a better mood, and they will live a more happier life.

I think it would be best to require community service for all students.

Community service can help people, make students feel great, and encourage them to always do more.

This would be the life of millions of people if they were to remove the Electoral College. There are many reasons why it is better to keep the Electoral College because it can avoid runoff elections, it will make certainty of outcome, and not having one region to elect a president. Having an Electoral College can change the fate of the people and all the states.

To begin with, runoffs elections can happen if there is no Electoral College, which can be a major problem if it can not be handled correctly. ""For example, in 1968 Nixon and Clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College."" With runoff elections there is pressure when no candidate wins a majority of the vost cast, which causes a huge problem when electing the president, but with the Electoral College it reduces the complication making it easier to see the winner. Electoral College helps to provide a clear winner rather than making it difficult. It makes the runoff election process simple.

Secondly, the Electoral College makes sure that there is an outcome. ""In the 2012's election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney."" This means that popular votes have some sort of outcome because it helps the electoral votes go up, but not all the time will the percents be the same. The electoral votes is what is used to decide the president.

Lastly, the Electoral College requires the runner ups to have a multiregional appeal. This is done because no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. For example, rodney was favored by the South in which he gets his electoral votes, but he cannot only count on the South to win the election he also needs to convince the other regions. North, East, etc. Trying to convince the other regions is difficult, but the outcome can help change the future.

To conclude, The electoral College have a positive effect rather than negative. It can help stop the complications when there is a runoff election. Having one makes sure that there is a outcome to one side. Also, forces runner ups to have a multiregional appeal. Keepin the Electoral college can help the United States in a positive way.",0,train_essays,,0

Although this may sound extremely crazy to some, most individuals accept the new law's for car's. Motorized vehicles have put a toll on our environment, our well being, and our wallets. By certain countries banning the use of motorized vehicles it has allowed individuals stress level to decrease, lowered air pollution, and increase money that citizens have. Gas cars that create pollution are a thing of the past, we are moving to electric cars, bicycles, and more the future is changing and its for our own benefits.

Cars are one of the main sources for people's stress, whether it be because of car failures, others who annoy you while you drive, or the fact you can never find a parking spot. Heidrun Walter claims "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way In German suburb, Life goes on without Cars 3."" One main reason people are less tense and stress is because people do not have to constantly worry about if another car is about to hit them, if traffic is going to be to slow to get to work, or if your car is going to breakdown on you. Car's create unwanted stress that can be easily avoided. Indeed life would be very different without cars people in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have all been able to function properly without motorized vehicles. In fact ""70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold cars to move her In German Suburbs, Life goes on without Cars 3."" These individuals have proven that it is okay to make a switch. In order for you to reduce stress in your life, you have to take away the source of stress, and that is what citizens have done, and without cars majority of people are happier and healthier.

Due to citizen's of Bogota, Paris, and Germany not using cars and having to switch to bikes, walking, and electric bikes has greatly reduced toxic gases in the environment. Due to individuals in Paris not excessively using cars the amount of smog has reduced. According to Robert Duffer "" after days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city Paris bans driving due to smog 10."" Paris has enforced strict rules that rejects people from driving, also a switch to diesel fuels. In return these ideas have lowered the level of smog in Paris creating a cleaner environment for the citizen. Not only has Paris help reduce toxic gases from entering our environment, but so has Bogota. In the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky stated that this has been Bogota's ""thrid year straight that cars have been banned for one day"" and the only motorized vehicles they have used are ""buses"". This switched has dramatically cut traffic, rush hour, and the amount of smog left in the air. Although there is still traces of pollution after this day it has lowered. The reasons are simple, using less cars makes less gases, also those who go the day without using cars may like the change better and permantely switch to a lifestyle without cars.

Another thing that has been changed due to the limitation of car usages is that with individuals not having to buy a car, pay for insurance, and pay for gas, it has increased the amount of money citizens have in their wallets. Citizens of the United States of America have not exactly chosen to not use cars, but some have, the main reason Citizen of America have limited themself is due to a lack of money. During our ""recession"" Americans were ""unemployed"" and ""unable to pay The end of car culture 32."" Because citizens were not able to pay for cars, they did not use them, thus as you get adapted to a new situation you tend to stay with it. After the switch citizens who chose to continue a life without a car, were able to have more money because they didnt have to pay for the cost that come with a car. Now some citizens have made the switch to not using motorized vehicles, which has helped increase the amount of money citizens have, which is always an advantage because you are able to pay for other things that are neccasary to your life.

Although cars seem like a material object that is so precious to life, it's not. In all reality people can live a life without cars, citizens in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have, and they enjoy it. Its time to make a switch and make a helpful change in your lifestyle. A life without cars is very benefitial, it is less stressful, lowers pollution, and has an increases of money. Although not using cars is a bit extreme, you can always make a better switch to using electric products, which can also help lower the amount of toxic gases in the air. Gas car's that produce extreme levels of gases are a thing of the past, I believe its time to move to the future.",0,train_essays,,1

The face is not that big of a deal. The face is a way for organizations to sell their products. As it says in the fifth paragraph, ""The 'face on mars' has become a pop icon.

However, the Venus has proved a very challenging place to explore or to examine more closely. In this exploring process, it will has a variety of stumbling blocks to make scientists stop to explore it. But actually, striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. So that's why people studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Here're some evidences regarding why the people still to explore it. For instance: Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation ( Paragraph 8). According to this evidence of the article, I can see innovation can help people discover more meaningful things and make country's development gradually more flourishing than before. "" NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus."" "" The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.""

B21F63120303,"Dear Principle,

I think student should be doing community service because in my opinion students should do community service because when they are leaning about the environment community service could show them what helping the community can do for them and their earth. I think the students in the school should have this opportunity to help out in their community. They will learn by them helping their community people just might realize they should help out in what should be more done around their community.

students will understand more about what good they will bring to there community if they help out, examples: picking up trash in local parks, recycling plastic bottles and soda cans. if more people would help out in their community more often on their free time personal i think the community we live in now will be more happier to live in. I honestly recommend that student in our school should be apart of helping their community, taking care of what they live in. I think it would also show the students how to be more safe and more aware of what they can do to make there community allot better and happier to live in.

The most simplest things that your students in your school could do by recycling, throwing their trash away instead of throwing it on the ground and would help more then anyone could possible imagine. Your students could have a fundraiser to make helping their community fun to do and they would also be showing other out of school what they can do as well to help out their community and with the simplest things. Many people think that helping their community is boarding and not worth doing, but if u really think about it helping our community would make a great change in how people would think about what they lived in.

So what I'm trying to get at is that not only it would help our community i think it would help our school learn how to take care of were we live and make it a better place.            ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

C834107D49D3,"Have you ever asked anyone for advice, well I have. Asking for someone else's advice can be very helpful because there is more then just one or two ways to do something. Their's not just one path you can take, matter of fact there's at least six different paths you can take. So I think advice is very important because it can help you with problems, questions,and how to do something.

Have you ever had a problem that you didn't know how to solve, this is where advice comes in handy. When you have a problem and you don't know how to solve it just ask some one for their advice it could work. Half of the time your own advice is going to lead you down the wrong trail. Some people don't ask for advice because they think their own is better or they just simply dont care about what the other persons has to say. Therefore I think getting advice is a good start to solving a problem.

If you have a question ask some one for their advice they might have the answer to your question. Advice is a very good way to solve a problem or a question. Personally I go to my grandmother and ask her for advice because I know she has the answer to 90% of my questions. I have a lot of questions because I'm a very curious boy and the internet give me false information 80% of the time, so advice is my number one thing. Therefore I think advice is and start to answering a question or it could be the answer to your question.

Have you ever been building a model or doing homework and not knowing how to do something... this is where advice comes in the handiest. Not knowing how to do somethings angers me the most especially in a video game. I live in a house where I'm the main one who knows how to do stuff. So if I don't know how to do something then nobody knows. Therefore I think advice is the one way ticket to learning how to do something.

So in conclusion I think advice is a very useful and effective way how to get things done every day. In my house me and my grandmother are the two smartest people in the house, but my grandmother is the only one give advice. This is because she is the smartest and oldest and she been through millions of different scenarios. So I think advice is very important because it can solve problems, answer questions,and help you do something.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
E110443F5184,"As an eighth-grader, I believe that character traits play a crucial role in our lives. They define who we are and how we interact with others. Choosing the right character traits can be beneficial in many ways, including personal growth, success, and happiness.

One of the most important character traits is integrity. Integrity refers to being honest and having strong moral principles. People with integrity are trustworthy and reliable, and they always do the right thing, even when it's difficult. By choosing to be honest and ethical, we can build strong relationships with others and gain their respect. Furthermore, having integrity can help us make better decisions and avoid getting into trouble.

Another important character trait is perseverance. Perseverance refers to the ability to keep working hard even when things get tough. People with perseverance are determined and don't give up easily. By choosing to persevere, we can overcome obstacles and achieve our goals. Furthermore, having perseverance can help us develop resilience and become stronger in the face of adversity.

Finally, kindness is a character trait that can make a big difference in our lives. Kindness refers to being considerate and caring towards others. People with kindness are empathetic and try to make others feel happy and comfortable. By choosing to be kind, we can improve our relationships with others and create a positive atmosphere. Furthermore, having kindness can help us feel more fulfilled and happy in life.

In conclusion, choosing the right character traits can be beneficial in many ways. By developing traits such as integrity, perseverance, and kindness, we can improve our personal growth, success, and happiness.

A828480AA508,"Hey, I'm like, totally stoked to be writing this essay about how developing a positive attitude can help a person achieve success in life! 😃

So, like, I know some people might think that success is all about being super smart or talented, but I think it's way more important to have a positive attitude. Like, if you're always thinking negative thoughts and stuff, you're gonna have a hard time achieving your goals. But, if you're all like, ""I can do this! 💪"", then you're way more likely to succeed!

I mean, think about it. Like, there are tons of successful people out there who have achieved their goals because of their positive attitude. For example, Oprah Winfrey is like, super successful, and she's always talking about how important it is to have a positive mindset. And, like, Richard Branson, he's a billionaire and he's always saying that he's grateful for everything he has, even when things get tough.

So, like, it's totally important to have a positive attitude because it helps you stay motivated and focused on your goals. And, like, it's way easier to bounce back from setbacks when you have a positive attitude. Instead of getting all down and stuff, you can just be like, ""Okay, this didn't work out, but I'll try again tomorrow!""

And, like, I think it's also important to be grateful for what you have, even if it's not a lot. Like, when I was in 7th grade, I didn't have the best grades, but I was still grateful for the education I was getting. And, like, now that I'm in 8th grade, I'm way more confident in my abilities, and I know that I can achieve my goals.

So, like, how can individuals create a plan to reach their own goals and be successful? Well, I think it's important to set specific, measurable goals, and then make a plan to achieve them. And, like, it's also important to be flexible and open to change, because sometimes things don't go as planned.

DB6025F937EA,"Dear Mr. Senator,

Today I am asking for your favor of keepig the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. This process now consists of the selection of the electors and meeting where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of votes by the congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, but only 270 of those votes are required to elect the president. I think that we should change the way that our citizens vote. I also think that we should update how the elections are run.

First of all, we should change the way that our citizens vote. When we vote for a president we are actually just voting for that Elector. So there is a possibility that the Elector could vote for the opposite president and your vote basically not be put in. I think that our citizens should have enough rights that they dont have to have Elector to do the voting for them and we can all just vote for who we want. For instance, it could be just all politics and the Electors get paid to vote for a certain person and thats why most of the presidents who get elected get elected today.

Secondly, We should update how the voting system works. Instead of it being 270 people out of 538, we should just have everyone one vote without Electors. Then everyone would have there say in the voting system and then they could just average it out or figure out the math of who won by percentage. For instance, take the number of all the people who voted for both presidents and take the number of one of the presidents and divide them by eachother and multiply it times 100. Then all the political stuff wouldnt happen because everyones vote counted. Maybe a change in the system would be a good idea.

Last but not least, In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, Bradford said that in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that vote would not have actually gone to Kennedy. So the Electors are not as reliable as everyone thought. Some Electors have also refused to to vote for there parties canidate. My honest opinion is to just change the Electoral College.

In conclusion, I am writting to you Mr. Senator in hopes that you can fix the Electoral College and change the election to a popular vote. If this were to happen, it could make our citizens have a little more rights. We may also update our system a little bit so that the election voting is a little more accurate so that everyone gets to get there vote in. Maybe this could be what solves most of the political problems in the world.

On monday motorist with even-numbered license plates have been ordered to leave their cars at their homes for the day while odd-numbered license plates were permitied to drive that day and they would switch off every day. seems like an effective plan. although you must always think about the people who dont follow the rules. For example a driver only aloud on tuesday due to his or her odd-numbered license plate drives their car on a monday. these motorist would be issued a fine of 22 euro which in american currency is $31. a large number of motor isnt were not please with this act. in result of this act almostt 4,000 drivers were fined twenty-seven of those motorist had their vehicles impounded for their actions towards the fine they recieved. either they refused to pay or they drove again when they werent aloud to or may have acted in a hostel manner.

congestion droped around 60 percent in the capital of france after five continuos days of intesifying smog. The smog debated between beijing france and china which is the most polluted city. people wanted to know what was to blame for this.

8AE119913109,"Long distance learning is a program that certain schools have implemented, which allows students to attend schools from home through video communication. This may seem tempting for many students, but they should be cautious. While long distance learning may be helpful for some with mental or physical disabilities, it is not helpful to the average student. Working from home could result in feeling disconected from the subject and increased destraction.

There is a reason that many teenagers fail to comlete their homework; it's because at home there are many more destractions than there are at school. School is a place that is meant to teach you, but home is where the student keeps their X-BOX. Why waste seven hours at school when they could just play video games? When many students attend college, this becomes an issue as well. When they do not have anyone telling them that they have to attend class, they decide to skip. However, if a parent or bus driver is present to ensure that the student is walking through the front door, then it is more likely the student will attend their classes. Once their in the school, most destractions are removed.

Even if the student can filter out all destractions, the problem of distance becomes an issue. Students can feel discontected from their teacher and the subject, since they are one step removed from them. When students are conecting with their teachers online, many new variables come into play: wifi can become an issue, the teacher has a limited view of what the student is doing, they are also relying almost entirely on their voice, and the student may need to hold up their papers to the screen, which wastes time with the teacher. Being there in person is a much better way to learn, because the teacher can see their whole class, and can move freely around the classroom. If they a student needs help, the teacher also doesn't need to rely only on their voice to communicate with them. This freedom results in a much less complicated learning experience.

While many students may think that working from home is right for them, they may not understand what it entails. There are so many destractions and complications that could get in their way, that they are just better off going to school. Some may argue that long distance learning gives oppertunities to those who are unable to attend regluar school, and that may be true. However, for the average student, learning in this way will not give a satisfactory result.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
b9644010,"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly recognized around the world. In Vauban, Germany, residents have given up their cars and have found that their overall quality of life has improved. The streets of Vauban are completely car-free, with the exception of the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move to this car-free community. Residents have found that living without cars has reduced their stress and made them happier overall. This experiment in low-car suburban life is being adopted in other areas to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation.

Limiting car usage is also an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, that number can be as high as 50%. By separating suburban life from auto use, as seen in Vauban and other car-free communities, we can make significant strides in reducing these emissions.

Cities around the world are also implementing measures to limit car usage. Paris, for instance, recently enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home and the same applied to odd-numbered plates the following day. As a result, congestion in Paris decreased by 60 percent and the smog cleared enough for the ban to be lifted. This demonstrates that limiting car usage is not only beneficial for the environment, but also for public health and safety.

Bogota, Colombia has taken it a step further by implementing an annual car-free day. Millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work on this day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This program has been successful in Bogota and has even spread to other countries. Municipal authorities from other countries have come to Bogota to see the event and have been enthusiastic about the potential for change.

In the United States, there is also a growing shift in behavior when it comes to car usage. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. Researchers believe this may be a fundamental shift in American culture and could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, so reducing car usage can have a significant impact. The car industry may need to adapt to this cultural shift by offering a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. Not only does it improve the overall quality of life for residents, but it also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves public health and safety, and promotes alternative transportation options. As we continue to see successful examples of car-free communities and initiatives around the world, it is clear that limiting car usage is an effective solution for a more sustainable future.",1,radek_500,,5

falcon_180b_v1_78,"The Face on Mars has been a topic of discussion for many years, with some believing that it was created by aliens while others believe it to be a natural formation. However, the evidence suggests that the Face is just a natural landform, and there are numerous reasons to support this claim.

Firstly, it is important to consider the size and shape of the Face as well as its location. The Face appears to be a large mesa that is located on the Cydonia region of Mars, and it has an unusual shape that resembles a human face. However, the shape of the Face could simply be a product of geological activity on the planet, such as erosion or wind patterns.

Secondly, the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' states that the Face was first photographed by the Viking spacecraft in 1976, and subsequent missions to Mars have captured images of the Face in greater detail. These images have allowed scientists to study the Face more closely, and they have found that there is no evidence to suggest that the Face is an alien structure. Rather, it appears to be a natural formation that has been shaped by geological forces over time.

Furthermore, the article points out that the Face is just one of many unusual formations that can be found on Mars. There are also other formations that resemble human-made structures, such as pyramids and canals, but these have been shown to be natural formations as well. This suggests that the Face is simply another example of the unusual geological activity that is present on Mars.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform that has been shaped by geological forces over time. While it may appear to resemble a human face, this is likely due to the effects of erosion or wind patterns on the planet. Therefore, it is important to consider the evidence before jumping to conclusions about the nature of the Face on Mars.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"You have read the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

Going to school, makes it more interesting and exposes one to a different world. Attending classes from home would help students get a better understanding of what is being thought, develop the skill of communication, and also join other school clubs.

Students would be able to understand better of what is being thought in the class. Sometimes when lessons are being thought in class, one might not get what the teacher said, he or she will then go back to the teacher or even a friend to ask for help. Subjects such as Chemistry, Culinary, Welding, Art and Fashion Marketing, needs more attention and practicals in class. For example, in a Fashion Marketing class where students are told to buy fabrics and sew a piece of garments as their project work. This project work will efficiently be done when helped by the teacher in class rather than it being done at home.

Not only will students get a better understanding in class, but also develop the habit of communicating with others. When students begin to associate themselves with others, they learn how to relate and react with the people around them which builds up a good relationship and teach them how to cooperate with other people.

Notwithstanding the fact that students would be able to get a better understanding of what is being thought in class and also interact with others, they would also be exposed to different school activities and clubs such as, Soccer, Basketball, Volleyball, Key Club, Science and Maths Club, Art Club, Dance Club, Drama Club, etc.

In school, they would become more active, develop good relationships, understand studies better, learn the habit of communicating with others and engage themselves in other activities that would help them in the future. Therefore, one would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

85E46E4774B2,"To whom it my concern;

I believe that students should be able to use their phones at school only during their free periods. This is because this nation of ours runs on using their cellular devices. Also most use their phones to call their friends, family, and other such people. In addition people use their phones to plan activities after school or to contact their parental figure to find out if their friends would be able to come over to their house after the school day is over.

First students use their phones to contact their friend and family. For example students call their parents to see if a friend could come over and hang out. Also phones are used in the case of an emergency like a fire of earthquake. This shows that phones are a good thing and are therefore capable of being aloud at school. As a result we use our phones for many reasons.

Second phones help students to be organised. For example phones have calendars on them which are good for planning events and making plans for after school. Also they can set ring tones that can alert you if you're late to an appointment. This shows that phones are not only good for getting in touch with people but also are good for organisation. As a result phones help to make people more sufficient.

In closing students should be able to use heir phones at school, because it helps to plan the rest of their day and other events as well. Also phones should be aloud at schools because of their safe nature. This is important because if phones are not aloud at schools then all students would be running around like chickens without heads. As a result phones should be aloud at school.

It's easy to get caught up in the desire to fit in and be accepted by others, but at the end of the day, being yourself is the most important thing.

As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" This statement rings true, but many people struggle to achieve it. Society often brainwashes us into believing that we need to be someone else in order to be successful or happy. However, this couldn't be further from the truth.

Being yourself allows you to truly connect with others on a deeper level. When you're being authentic, people can sense it, and they are more likely to form genuine connections with you. On the other hand, when you're trying to be someone else, you're essentially lying to people, which can lead to hurt feelings and a lack of trust.

It's important to remember that being yourself is not always easy, but it's worth it. By embracing your true self, you'll be able to live a more fulfilling life and form stronger, more meaningful relationships. So, take pride in being yourself and don't be afraid to stand out from the crowd.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

If the student start their summer project student can be creative with their work by putting effort into it. student can choose if they want to do it colorful and creative or plain student have a choice if they want their work all bright and pretty or simple and plain. If the student choose colorful and creative there work might include with picture, color, detail, and what they might do during break showing that whoever made this work put a lot of thought and effort into it. If the student want to be simple with their work they might include white background, all word telling what they do during break, and a lot of mess of pencil mark. whatever they choose to be creative or not they will end up using their head to come up with these idea and student can make their project exciting or boring it up to them.

llama_70b_v1106,"Peoples often ask for advices from diffrent peoples. They do this because they want to get a better undrstanding of what they should do. When you ask mulitple peoples for advices, you can get diffrent point of views. This can help you because you can see what each person is saying and then you can put it all together to make a good choise. For example, if you ask your teacher and your parents for advices on weather you should do your homework or play a video game, your teacher might say that you should do your homework so you can get good grades. But your parents might say that it's importint to have fun and play video games so you can relese stress. Then you can think about both sides and decide what you want to do.

Another reason why it's good to ask mulitple peoples for advices is that you can get more information. If you only ask one person, they might not know everything about the subjet. But if you ask more peoples, you can get a better undrstanding of the subjet because each person might know something diferent. For example, if you ask your friends and your brother for advices on how to make a good fist, your friends might say that you should curl your fingers and your brother might say that you should keep your thumb outside. Then you can put it all together and make a good fist.

Sometimess asking mulitple peoples for advices can also help you to not make a mistake. If you only ask one person, they might tell you something that is not true. But if you ask more peoples, you can check if what they are saying is true or not. For example, if you ask your teacher and your friend for advices on weather you should jump of a bridge, your teacher might say that it's not a good idear and your friend might say that it's a bad idear to. Then you can see that it's not a good choise to jump of a bridge.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help you to make a better choise because you can get diffrent point of views, more information, and you can avoit making a mistake. So the next time you need to make a choise, ask mulitple peoples for advices and think carefully about what they say.",1,llama_70b_v1,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

767A8DA91E69,"No one starts off knowing what to do in life, you can't be sure until you've tried many different things. That's why I think Each student should have to participate in extracurricular activities outside of their classes in school. Extracurricular activities are a great way to engage students brain's in subjects they're passionate about and is also a good way for students to find new hobbies. Without the students being exposed to many different activities they might never find their talent and what they want to pursue in life.

After school activities are a great way to keep the brain working even after the school day is over. Students can stay active whilst doing something they are passionate about like a sport or community service. For instance I do yearbook in school as one of my electives and sometimes I like to work on designs, quotes, and formatting at home. This is a great way to stay active by doing something that I like and something that benefits the school as well.

Putting students out of their comfort zones by encouraging them to try new things is also a great way for students to find activities that want to pursue. Maybe someone has played soccer ever since they were in second grade and they've never tried basketball, however when they get to middle school they finally try basketball and realize they love it. You can never be sure that you dont want to do something until you try it. For instance Lebron James didnt know he wanted to play basketball until he was introduced to it so you never know if your going to be the next star.

If every student did one or more extracurricular activity everyday the school could accomplish so many more projects. Students would be encouaged to pursue topics they're passionate about and would have the freedom of choice and they would also find new things they love doing and create new expiriences. All they need is a little encouagement.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

One example of this is the developement of the diverless cars. For years many creative people have always dream of making this real to help humans' enviorment, transportation, and safetyness. If this developement of these driverless cars is to help humans improve their lives than the developement should countinue.

If people are going to invent something that helps the humans they must as well invent something that helps the enviorment. In todays world we know that there is a lot of chemicals in the air and that many of us are affected. Actually everyone is affected be it. If the amount of gas is reduce in half and maybe we can safe todays' world. Wiht the reducement of contamination in the air the more safer is the air for humans to be able to breath it in.

In today's world transportation is assensional in our lives. Because today's society has made humans move and have faster lives than a human that lived in the 1700s would have we depend more on cars or anything that has four wheels and a motor. Just image being in New York City and not being able to get a taxi or always arriving late to imortant meetings. In this kind of problems the diverless cars are able to fix this since they offer far more flexibility than a bus and finally you are able to get to place on time without a problem.

The most important goal of creating the diverless cars is for the safety of humans. As the years pass people have created sensors. Sensors can causes the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce the power from the engine of the car, allowing far better response and control than and human driver could mange alone. But this is not the end of senors. People have made futher improvements on them and computer hardware and software to make sure to make driving safer also leading to cars that handle more and more tasks on their own.

Eventhough the invention of the drverless cars has a long way to be completed the difficulties are not going to be an obsticle for the people who want to see this dream become real.

81D266D94D6D," Do we ever feel surprised when people's behavior changes over time? This is because our first impressions of them can be difficult to change. While it is true that people can change, it is also true that their behavior is often influenced by their first impressions. This is why it is important to be cautious when judging people based on their initial behavior.

First impressions are not always accurate, and people can change their behavior for a variety of reasons. For example, a person may act a certain way in order to impress someone or to achieve a specific goal. This is not necessarily a reflection of their true character. Additionally, people may change their behavior due to external factors such as stress, depression, or poverty. These factors can affect a person's behavior and make it difficult for them to act in a way that is consistent with their true character.

It is also important to remember that people can change their behavior for the better or for the worse. For example, a person who was once very shy may become more outgoing and confident with time. On the other hand, a person who was once very confident may become more reserved and cautious. It is up to each individual to decide how they want to change their behavior and to work towards making those changes.

It is important to approach people with an open mind and to be willing to see them in a new light. This means being patient and understanding when someone's behavior changes, and not jumping to conclusions about their character based on their initial impressions. Instead, we should strive to get to know people on a deeper level and to form our opinions about them based on our experiences with them over time.

In conclusion, people's behavior can change over time, and it is important to be aware of this when forming our opinions about them. While first impressions can be difficult to change, people can change their behavior for a variety of reasons, and it is up to each individual to decide how they want to change their behavior. By approaching people with an open mind and being willing to see them in a new light, we can form more accurate and positive opinions about them.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

There are many people who you could like a family member or your friends cause those who are the people are the closets to you.

When looking for different people's advises, you want them to see your perspective and see which is the best choice you can do or sometimes maybe you wanna buy a car. You wanna get friends opinion on whether you should buy a car or not cause getting their opinions will help make the best decision. I think it would better to ask a friend for their opinion when making a financial decision cause maybe you have a friend that already has a car. You could ask that friend what its like to get car and the steps to it and they could tell whether its a good decision or not. Sometimes a friends decision might not be that helpful so you could ask your family like your parents or siblings.

Families are better to get an advice because youre parents are the people who already went through what you are going through so they could give you the best advice on how to be better. For example, when making life decision, I think its best to go to a family member because those are the people who can really help you. Maybe you wanna choose a college you wanna go to but you don't where to go, you could ask a sibling our parents where could be the best place for you to go and tell you how its like to go to college. You may have an older sibling who went to college and graduated, so you can ask them how its like to be in college and what are the goods and bad and give you advice on how to get through college without it being hard for you. Some siblings could even recommend you to go to the military or army, anything related to that because there are benefits to that and help you with school. Families are better to get an advice because youre parents are the people who already went through what you are going through so they could give you the best advice on how to be better

They give you the advice to chose what you like to do as a career and then you start to do research on colleges that could be best for the career you wanna take. You finally make your decision on what you wanna do as your career and what college you wanna go to, to pursue that career. You realize that you can't make a lot of decisions on your own without help from others.

For example, if someone was forced to come in to work on a day off, he or she may have to give up spending time with family. Being forced to do something is never a fun experience. Students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not be interested, some may not have transportation, and students may begin to stress.

Students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not be interested. Participating in clubs or groups are not for everybody. If a student does not desire to participate in an extracurricular activity, he or she should not have to. If the student is forced to, he or she may not do any work. For example, a student was forced to participate in an after school club. During the club, the student would talk out and misbehave. The student was disrespectful to the club leader and acted in a disorderly manner. When asked, the student replied, ""I was forced to be here."" If students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, a student may not do any work out of a lack of interest.

It should not be required for students to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not have a means of transportation. This may happen because the student's parent could be busy. A lot of parents have to work late. They don't have suitable hours that will allow them to pick up or drop off their child at school. There have been countless times when students would stand outside waiting to be picked up from an after school activity. The students would stand outside for a long period of time. Standing outside without adult supervision can be dangerous for a student. A parent should not have to worry about getting his or her child home safely because the child was required to stay after school.

If a student is required to participate in an extracurricular activity, it may cause him or her to stress. Some extracurricular clubs and groups require students to conduct a lot of work outside the club or group. In situations like this, students tend to worry about completing all work for their part of the group. For instance, students have different levels of productivity. Some can balance out school work and extracurricular work while others are not able to. If a student does not have high productivity, this may cause him or her to stress about all the work. While trying to balance out all this work, the students grades may begin to drop. This can lead to even more stress than the student can handle. Schools should not require students to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may begin to stress.

Students should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not be interested and may not have a means of transportation. A student may also have trouble balancing out extracurricular work and school work. Though at the end of the day, everyone has his or her own purpose in life. It may be to do big things or some may want to do small things. It is not fair to be forced to do something that an individual may not want to do.

BC5B1BBADA5D,"Dear Principle,

You are reconsidering the use of cell phones and whether or not we should be allowed to use them in school. A few students got together and started coming up with reasons we should be able to have access to our phones at school.

Some parents need to get a-hold of kids and do not feel it is the school's business about what it is their student needs to know. An appointment might have come up and there is no way for the parent to pick their kid up from school. If a student is not allowed to have their cell phone there is no way they would know this. Or vice versa, a student might need to tell a parent something that they do not feel comfortable talking to a teacher or someone in authority about.

They could need their parent to bring them lunch because they forgot it at home, or medicine because they are not feeling well. Teachers do not appreciate when students take up class time with the need to call their parent(s) about a homework assignment or pick up arrangements and most often do not allow students to do so.

Also, there is no way to inform parents of danger if it happens to come up during school. During lock downs or fire drills, parents are in a panic trying to make sure their kid is okay. If something were to happen and a there was a criminal who broke into the school, kids should be able to have their phones to at least let their parents know they are okay or inform them of the situation.

Kids need freedom! There are so many rules at school, and with allowing cell phones at school; there will also be rules along with the new freedom, but consider allowing that freedom. Rights can always be taken away if they are not earned.

After all the students hard work, most of them anyway, they deserve to enjoy one thing they have been working to get at school for years; cell phones. If you give them the right, they will have to follow the rules and expectations and it doesn't mean it is permanent. Try it out and if it doesn't work you can revoke the privilege, but a chance is all they want.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or changed to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. After careful consideration and analysis of the information from multiple sources, including the texts provided, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept for the following reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. It ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote surpasses their share of the popular vote, making it less likely for disputes over the election’s outcome to occur. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner-take-all basis of most states' allocation of electoral votes leads to landslide victories for the winning candidate, thereby reducing the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College fosters the idea of a president being everyone's president. This system requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal since no single region has enough electoral votes to determine the outcome. As mentioned by Judge Posner, a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president as it may leave residents of other regions feeling disregarded and disenfranchised. By necessitating candidates to broaden their appeal beyond a single region, the Electoral College ensures that the elected president represents the entire nation's interests.

Moreover, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, encouraging candidates to pay close attention to the concerns and issues faced by voters in these states. As stated in Judge Posner's text, swing states receive extensive campaign efforts and information from candidates due to their potential to decide the election. This engagement fosters thoughtful voting, as voters in these states have a greater incentive to closely evaluate and consider the candidates' policies and plans for the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some weight to the political balance that large states might otherwise lose due to the Senate's malapportionment. According to Judge Posner, the Electoral College gives large states more attention from presidential candidates, as victories in these states yield a higher number of electoral votes. This ensures that candidates cannot solely focus on the concerns of smaller states, which could lead to the neglect of the interests of larger, more populous states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections by ensuring that a majority winner is always determined. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the Electoral College eliminates the pressure for run-off elections when no candidate secures a majority of the votes cast. This simplifies the presidential election process, avoiding further complications and costs associated with additional voting rounds.

While some argue that a change to a popular vote system would make the electoral process fairer, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks. Moving to a popular vote system would concentrate campaign efforts solely on densely populated urban areas and neglect the interests of smaller states and rural communities. Additionally, it could potentially lead to run-off elections and endless recounts when no candidate secures a majority of the votes cast.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept due to the certainty of outcome, the principle of everyone's president, the focus on swing states, the balance it brings to large and small states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. While improvements can always be made to the system, the Electoral College effectively serves its purpose of representing the diverse interests of the American people. I urge you to consider the valuable aspects of the Electoral College when evaluating potential changes to our electoral process.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to seeing our system flourish while maintaining its integrity.

Sincerely,

BB8DBBD8C4AB,"In today's world, it can be challenging to be yourself. With the constant pressure to conform to societal expectations and the constant need to present a perfect image, it can be difficult to be true to ourselves. However, it is important to learn to be proud of our true selves, as it can lead to greater happiness and fulfillment in life.

One of the main reasons it is hard to be ourselves is because of the constant pressure to conform to societal expectations. We are told what we should wear, what we should eat, and how we should act in order to fit in with our peers. This can be especially challenging for those who do not fit into traditional gender roles or who come from different cultural backgrounds. For example, I have struggled with my weight my entire life, and I have often felt pressure to conform to the societal standard of beauty. This has led me to try various diets and exercise regimes, but I have never been able to achieve the body type that is considered ""ideal."" Instead of accepting my body for what it is, I have often felt ashamed and self-conscious, leading me to hide my true self.

Another reason it is hard to be ourselves is because of the constant need to present a perfect image. With the rise of social media and the constant comparison to others, it can be easy to feel like we need to present a perfect image in order to be accepted. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, as we constantly compare ourselves to others and feel like we are falling short. For example, I have struggled with social anxiety for most of my life, and I often feel like I need to put on a front in order to fit in with my peers. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, as I am not able to be my true self around others.

Despite these challenges, it is important to learn to be proud of our true selves. When we are able to accept ourselves for who we are, we can experience greater happiness and fulfillment in life. For example, I have learned to embrace my body for what it is, and I have stopped trying to fit into the societal standard of beauty. This has led to a greater sense of self-acceptance and confidence, and I have been able to focus on other aspects of my life, such as my passions and hobb",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,4
3716F4794AB4,"Online or video conferencing is seen by schools as an option for students to attend classes from home. I Think students would not benefit from attending class at home than they would attending classes at schools. Students would lose the opportunity to communicate with the teachers and other students about the topics they are learning about. Online classes don't keep up with what the student has learned and what the student needs help with. Online Classes are not a good option for students because they would not be able to communicate and ask questions, Students wouldn't take it as serious and cheat, and students would lose the option of extracurricular activities and to socialize with other students.

Online classes are not a good option for students because they cannot communicate and ask questions that could benefit their learning. For example if the classes were not prerecorded or all written down and you had to listen to a teacher talk online, if you miss any information you wouldn't be able to communicate directly to the teacher for some time and wouldn't be able to ask questions until after the lesson. If the class was thought through notes online then students would't be able to communicate with the teacher directly and would have to email them which would take time for them to respond. Students need to think about the information they are learning and not asking questions and making connections, could hurt students when they are taking a test.

Students would not take online school as serious as being in a classroom and learning and would probably end up cheating because they are in their own home. Online classes wouldn't be able to supervise or restrict students from cheating on an assignment or a test depending on what website or program the students are using to take the class. Students can access any program when they use their own computers unless they are provided b'y the online school. Students could become lazy and skip the lessons because students would feel they have the option because they are in their own home.

Online distance learning also takes away the option for students to socialize with other students and to attend or take extracurricular activities after school that they would normally take if they were at school. Students would not be able to work on any assignments or share any information with other students and would have to work alone. Students would not be able to join school sports, to be part of a team or to just be a little active instead of staying in your house all day, or attend other after school activities that would allow students to socialize and learn about more information that other schools provide after school. Students would lose the opportunity to stay after school with the teacher and ask questions and ask for help.

Online distance learning would not benefit students because it takes away the option of direct communication which is key when it comes to learning new curricular. The chance of cheating and laziness increase with taking online classes because its based on your schedule and you learn from your own computer. Also it takes away from socializing with other students and making new friends to spend time with and also losing the option to try after school activities. Also students could have many issues accessing the lessons which would ultimately disrupt their learning. Some schools may offer the option to attend classes while at home but students wouldn't benefit as much as attending classes at school.        ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

Usi5ng your phone while driving is very dangerous because a lot of people die because of texting and driving. Especially a lot of teenagers who drive use social media while they're driving.

Which is one of the main cause for so many deaths not only in teens but in adults.

As social media continues to progress and now that everything is on the Internet texting and driving isn't the main issue. The main issue is that there is nothing that is stopping people from being on their phones in general. Phones in general are a big distraction and especially while driving. People will tend to look at emails, check social media, or just simply send a text message while they are at stop sign but that can be just as dangerous as well because as the driver hits the gas they are looking at their phones at the same time and then boom that's wen the big accident happens. This is a very common thing that happens with a lot of people who aren't careful enough to put their phones down and pay attention to the road.

A lot like drinking and driving many teens they can get away with texting and driving, but what they don't know is that being behind the wheel and looking at your screen at the same time is a dangerous. While recording yourself behind the wheel is another mistake waiting to happen.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
75707305C76D,"As an 8th grader, I have been pondering the advantages and disadvantages of having a more advanced learning experience. After conducting research and analyzing the benefits, I have come to the conclusion that having a more advanced learning experience can provide numerous advantages in various aspects of life.

One of the most significant advantages of having a more advanced learning experience is the career experience. Graduating early or taking advanced courses can provide students with a head start in their chosen career. For instance, taking advanced math and science courses can prepare students for college-level courses, making them more competitive in the job market. Moreover, graduating early can give students a chance to gain work experience, which can be beneficial in building their resume and making them more attractive to potential employers.

Another advantage of having a more advanced learning experience is the benefits of graduating early. Graduating early can provide students with a sense of accomplishment and pride in their academic achievements. It can also give them a chance to explore their interests and passions without feeling burdened by the pressure of completing high school. Additionally, graduating early can provide students with more time to focus on extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, or volunteer work, which can help them develop their skills and character.

In terms of recommendations, having a more advanced learning experience can provide students with more opportunities for scholarships. Many colleges and universities offer scholarships to students who have taken advanced courses or graduated early. These scholarships can help students cover the cost of tuition, textbooks, and other expenses, making higher education more accessible and affordable.

Furthermore, having a more advanced learning experience can have a significant impact on human society. By providing students with a more challenging and engaging education, they are more likely to become critical thinkers and problem solvers. This can help them make informed decisions and contribute to society in meaningful ways. Moreover, advanced learning experiences can foster creativity and innovation, leading to new discoveries and breakthroughs that can benefit humanity as a whole.

Finally, pre-AP classes are an excellent way for students to prepare for the rigors of college-level courses. These classes provide students with a more challenging curriculum, which can help them develop the skills and knowledge they need",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

52A9658B9B58,"The author states that Venus is a worthy pursuit to go for even though there are dangers present.

While there are some dangerous features on Venus, the author's suggestion might be actually worth pursuiting.

There are many reasons to look forward to see Venus.

For example it was shown that scientist studied that there was some form of life on Venus.

Even though Venus is dangerous, it is still worthwhile to study.

Venus does have many physcial dangers that are present.

The text states, ""A thick atomsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atomsphere"" (Para 3).

There are also mild temperatures on Venus's surface itself.

Text goes on to state, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

Also, notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"" (Para 3).

This explains some dangers when pursuiting to see Venus.

But do not get caught up with the dangers of Venus.

There are still worthwhile things to look for when studying Venus.

The text states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit..."" (Para 4).

This explains the wonderful features that are worth it to see Venus.

There are as well other alternatives to exploring Venus if people do not want to be sent to Venus itself.

For example NASA has been working on other approaches to exploring Venus like making machines and computers.

The text states, ""... some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested ina chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" (Para 7).

Text goes on to state, ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. ...but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.

By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (Para 7).

This shows how these alternatives of exploring Venus can still be pursuited.

Although Venus is a dangerous planet to visit, there are scientist out there that would sitll go and explore Venus because of features that are worth studying for and give an idea of what it is like for Venus.

There are also maybe a possiblity of some form of life there.

Even if it is too dangerous to explore there are still many other ways to explore Venus.

There is much insight to be gained for this planet.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

E7F9A77683D2,"In recent years, schools have been grappling with the question of whether or not to allow the use of phones during school lunch. While some argue that it is necessary for students to stay connected with their families and friends, others believe that it is a distraction that takes away from the students' learning experience. In this essay, I will analyze the pros and cons of having a policy that allows the use of phones during school lunch versus a policy that doesn't allow the use of phones during school lunch.

On one hand, allowing the use of phones during school lunch can have several advantages. For one, it can help students stay connected with their loved ones. Many students have busy schedules and may not have the opportunity to speak with their families and friends during the school day. Allowing the use of phones during lunch can provide a brief respite from the academic rigor of the day and give students a chance to catch up with their loved ones.

Additionally, allowing the use of phones during school lunch can provide students with a sense of autonomy and control over their own learning experience. Many students are self-motivated and may use their phones to study or complete homework assignments during lunch. Allowing the use of phones during lunch can give these students the opportunity to take control of their own learning and make the most of their time.

On the other hand, there are also several disadvantages to allowing the use of phones during school lunch. One of the main concerns is that it can be a major distraction for students. Many students use their phones to play games, scroll through social media, or watch videos during lunch, which can take away from their ability to focus and learn during the rest of the school day. This can ultimately lead to lower academic performance and a decreased ability to learn.

Another disadvantage of allowing the use of phones during school lunch is that it can create a sense of unequal treatment for students. Some students may not have access to a phone or may not be able to afford one, which can create a sense of exclusion and unfairness for these students. This can also create a sense of pressure for students to have a phone, which can be financially burdensome for some families.

In conclusion, the decision to allow or not allow the use of phones during school lunch is a complex one. While there are certainly advantages to allowing the use of phones during lunch, there",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0
126039773F9A,"Dear State Senator,

In my experience, I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. If you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaine. On the other hand, i do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it.

First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some of the regiment in voters. In Plumer's article he says,"" - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with.

So let me explain one of my reasons, I believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attenetion to the votes sent out. Acorrding to Plumer's article, 'The Indefensible Electoral College:' he states, "" In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for who the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. If you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisified and feel that their vote would be fair.

Lastly, the second reason why I believe that  getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in who they vote. If they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article, ' In Defnse of the Electoral College:', Posner states, "" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote..."" With that said, there is support that states people would have beter interest in voting if they had  popular vote and no more electoral college. I believe people would actually spend more of their time on debating who should deserve to be President.

To conclude my reasons, please take them in consideration. Voters would be treated much fairly and pay more attention to voting than they do now. I believe you should get rid of the electoral college so there will be less arguing.

More than half of the people in the house are rushed to the hospital. As you can see there has been an atrocious accident because of that vehicle. Their should definitley be a limiting of car usage because their would be less car accidents , people would be able to spend less money on cars and we would have less air pollution. Also having a car can cause a lot of stress or tension for people.

Obviously we're having a lot of problems with money in this world , if we limit car usage that would really help is us out a lot. See as it states in source one paragraph two '' A car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars , along with a home.'' With those forty thousand dollars you can do a lot to help the world . It aslo says that fifty seven percent of the people who live in a suburban area sold their cars just move where they live at now. Who needs a car when you can just walk ''stores are placed a walk away, on a main street rather than the malls along some distant highway. ''source one paragraph 6.

Pollution is destroying our world and we need to help stop it, so here's an idea lets ban driving due to smog says Paris. Their was an enforced partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Do you agree with that? well I do and here's why . Paris has more smog than other European capitals so if they don't stop the smog it's going to be horrific for their city. Source three paragraph twenty one '' the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.'''Not having cars for one day is brilliant idea because is an improvement to the city of Bogota.

Their is a lot of disruptions an accidents going on because of cars mainly because of the traffic so if their was less cars it would be more peaceful. Usually when there's traffic you hear a lot honking and there's a lot fines for that. The fines are very expensive to pay so you're wasting a lot of money. Also when people are honking they don't realize that other people are sleeping . Everyone needs sleep , some people can't sleep through everything so all it takes is one honk and bam they're awake. Sleeping is really needed in your life imagine notgetting enough sleep because of traffic well yeah that would suck an a lot of people already go through that .

So in conclusion what I'm saying is car usage should definitly be limited at least in some countries or states. Money is a really big problem we have that needs to be solved and this is a great way. People living in a surburan area have to pay more just for extra parking places. Air pollution is very bad for the world with les cars that will stop as well.

D2D9D0C94A14,"a positive attitude in achieving success in life.

Having a positive attitude is crucial for achieving success in life. It is a well-established fact that our attitudes and mindsets shape our thoughts, actions, and ultimately our outcomes. A positive attitude can be the driving force behind our motivation, productivity, and overall well-being. In this essay, I will explore the impact of having a positive attitude on success in life, outline the rewards that come from having a positive attitude, explain how having a positive attitude can help a person overcome obstacles, compare and contrast the consequences of having a positive attitude against a negative, and summarize the importance of having a positive attitude in achieving success.

Firstly, research has shown that people with a positive attitude tend to have a higher likelihood of achieving their goals and succeeding in life. They are more optimistic, resilient, and adaptable, which enables them to handle setbacks and challenges more effectively. For instance, a study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania found that people with a positive attitude were more likely to achieve their fitness goals than those with a negative attitude. This is because they were more motivated, disciplined, and committed to their goals.

Secondly, having a positive attitude can bring numerous rewards, including improved mental and physical health, better relationships, and increased job satisfaction. When we have a positive outlook, we tend to focus on the good things in life, which can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. We also tend to be more optimistic about the future, which can lead to better decision-making and risk-taking. Additionally, people with a positive attitude tend to have stronger social connections and are more likely to form and maintain healthy relationships. Finally, having a positive attitude can lead to increased job satisfaction, as it can lead to better communication, collaboration, and productivity in the workplace.

Thirdly, having a positive attitude can help a person overcome obstacles and setbacks. When we have a positive outlook, we tend to view challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than threats to our success. This can help us develop a growth mindset, which enables us to embrace failure as a natural part of the learning process. Additionally, people with a positive attitude tend to be more resilient and adaptable, which allows them to bounce back from setbacks and continue pursuing their goals.

In other hand , is a good reason for the people still studied, and is not an excuse for say that they do not have time.

The people can recive the classes after, that work. Students can have more time for learn and they can choose when they want recive the classes they can organize their time. Also, it is a good idea for help people that even finished high school , they can be more focus on the differents classes and give the best of them.

Take classes by online it is a wonderful idea, because is something that can be avaliable for all people any time and in the cold days when is to difficult go outside students always will take the classes and they does not miss anything . This also, help to the studesnts to recive classes every day .

I am, completely agree with can take that classes online or video conferencing is a big benefict for students in addiction people that maybe never studied in their lives can take this classes and learn a lot, because some people have to work all day, and do not can in to a school that is a very big tool that can help their.

A lot of people can be agree and can support this great idea. Also, students that want lo learn a languaje or need support in a class can choose the class most need it . and can take and extra time to learn because they gonna take the clases in home and do not miss time taking a bus or driving a car.

Even people that is in school sometimes have to walk and it is so difficult , because sometimes is snowing or raining, and they miss more time and mometimes miss all day of classes . every minute counts and that is another one great reason to support it , because people can have more time.

Seconds can make a big difference, in their lives people can finished their goals and get a diploma for can have a better jod and still helping their families.

In addiction some people can get more adtitude and concentration, for each class they can take it in the living room, dinning room or just sit in the sofa, in the kitchen or bed, every place, where they want and fell more confortable, and if you fell confortable you can give the best you can.

I think that some people work better and get more concentration , when they are alone, because you do not talk with other people you work in your own. people do not can take answer from another people if are taking a online class, so it is another reason that a lot , because you have to doing your work. and you have to be concentrate and pay attention.

people also can take the classes in the wekends . the sudents that are taking classes by online can have the choice if they want to take and extra class or get support . I think that all people ,deserve can have the opportunity that can still studied. all people should have the same opportunity , It is also a good idea, because all people can get that clases and be better proffesionaly, and good citizens and help the world be the change that de world need it, because some people that are so itelligent do not have opportunity to get a good aducation even assist to high school and how i said before .

Some people, can be so proud know that can retake school or begging . thats will be a big hope for the people that is not study but they want to. It is a lot of reasons for can say that take classes by online or video conferencing is like the best idea that someone can have .

In other words take online classes is a great tool for that everyone can have acces to study. and get the same opportunities, that everyone deserve. and also help to learn more people can use their time apropiately. and can have acces to each class that they need it everyone can and can work and after take the classes .

2AF2200F56AC,"When seeking advice, many people refer to a variety of people with different perspectives. There are three reasons that would explain people's tendency to ask for multiple opinions before making a final decision. When we seek advice from more than one person, we do so because it shows us different viewpoints on a matter, provides us with more clarity of what we aspire to achieve, and we know that different people will give better advice in certain situations than in others and we shouldn't rely too heavily on any one person for a matter that they might not be familiar with.

First of all, the fact that no two people will provide the same opinion is inevitable given the fact that everyone comes from a different background and is taught to handle things differently than someone else. If one asked someone's advice and did not take the time to seek a variety of different opinions, they could not be certain that the advice they are being provided is right for their particular situation or that it is relevant. For example, if one broke their mother's favorite lamp and asked their best friend what they should tell their mother, that person is making the mistake of relying on only one person to give them advice in a matter that could need more than one opinion, like their sibling's or their father's. Based on that example, someone could be given bad advice by one person therefore risking making a wrong decision, but with more than one opinion, that person can increase their chances of making the decision that is right for them. Of course, there is also the matter of simplicity and liking. In these cases, asking advice from one person is not likely to provide us with the simple answer we're looking for. Furthermore, anyone seeking advice has a higher chance of being satisfied with their options and their outcome if they ask for more than one person's guidance.

Next, asking for multiple people's advice gives a clearer perspective on what one should aim to achieve or do. If someone asked their parents where they should go to college, they are likely to be given a biased opinion based on which school their parents attended or where they want to see their child go to school, but if this person asks their teachers for an unbiased opinion, they can get a clearer idea of what they could achieve. Advice from only one person could result in the person seeking it being confused or making the wrong choice because of having only listened to one person when others could provide simpler advice. In brief, the main issue with asking the opinion of one person is that the person in need of counsel would end up misunderstanding the person who provided advice or doing something that one told them to do, not to help them succeed, but for the other's own pleasure. So, to make the right decision, it is wise to ask more than one person for advice.

Lastly, seeking the opinion of someone trusted or believable in most cases is not always likely to provide the right advice in other circumstances. As in most cases, some people are better at some things than others. For this reason, relying on one person for everything comes with disadvantages. For example, one person could be amazing in English, but terrible in math. The same thing applies to seeking advice or opinion, like if one always asked their religion teacher what they should do because they trust them to give them moral advice, but then one day they came to ask them how they should study for their upcoming science test, and the religion teacher couldn't provide good advice because they studied to become a religion teacher, not a science teacher. For these reasons, one must be able to determine how the different people they know could help them (or not help them) based on their situation.

In conclusion, one has the best chance of reaching their goal if they refer to more than one person when seeking advice. The reasons that support this are that we can access a wider variety of opinions and viewpoints, can clearly understand what it is we are trying to obtain or achieve, and we can ask different people with different strong suits for the advice we need according to our circumstances.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
falcon_180b_v1_978,"I am a grade 9 student and I believe that summer projects should be student-designed, rather than teacher-designed. This is because it will allow students to explore and learn about their own interests, giving them the opportunity to take ownership of their own learning, rather than being told what to do by their teachers like they usually do during the school year.

When students design their own summer projects, they'll be more motivated and enthusiastic about their learning, leading to better results. They'll also gain valuable critical and creative thinking skills as they'll have to research, brainstorm their own ideas, and plan and implement their projects. For example, a student with a passion for gardening can plan a summer project to create a small vegetable or herb garden in their backyard, learning about soil types, fertilization, and harvesting of the crops.

On the other hand, teacher-designed projects tend to be very generic and often don't align with the student's personal interests. This can lead to disinterest and lack of engagement, which defeats the purpose of continuing learning over the summer. For instance, a teacher might assign students a book report or a research project on a general topic that students might not find engaging, leading to poor outcomes.

In conclusion, by giving students the opportunity to design their own summer projects, they'll develop a deeper understanding of their personal interests and passions while also learning and improving various skills. It will make their summer break more enjoyable and productive, leading to better performance in the upcoming school year.",1,falcon_180b_v1,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

B6572CED6B2E,"Phones and Driving

Phones and techknowledgey have changed a lot through our time. We have had a major impact with phones from being able to call wherever your at and having having access to the internet on your phone. There have been positive and negative effects. One major negative effect is drivers being able to be on their phones while driving a car. Many people feel the need to get that last text off or need to get that quick phone call in at a red light. Sounds quick and simple but this is very dangerous. This is dangerous do to the fact that people can get into car wrecks due to the fact they are worrying about their phone at that moment.

People forget that the road is shared with other people and that it is shared with other people being on there phone. The National Safety Council have estimated 1.6 million car crashes due to phones and nearly 400,000 injured. This is caused by that one text you have to get off or picture that your friend posted you have to like. This isn't only caused by teens this is also caused by parents. But many people have to use there phone wherever there at. Such as businessmen and lawyers. Because of what they due they have be able to answer the phone wherever there at because of their job. But however this is hazardous because of the fact this is more riskier.

People have invented and a new way of answering the phone with a touch screen cars and voice hearing cars. Not only that there have been bluetooth headphones and car tripods. This has had a big impact on car crashes and helping people do stuff without having to grab their phones and loose attention of the road. A lot of hands free stuff is helping it to. Many laws have tightened up on this. If getting caught in certain states such as Georgia you will get in trouble. Under the age of 18 is prohibited for drivers with permits and class-d licence.

You have to be safe on the road because of the law and car crashes. Even if your not the one on your phone that doesn't mean the person behind you is not. Driving is dangerous and everyone should take precaution when driving. People will drive while being drunk or any other reason. Even with the laws that are not going to stop some people from doing it. As a society we should stop and take a chance to prevent anything harming to others because of the fact that we don't know who is all in the car.

C534FA8C0BB5,"Have you ever seen an illusion where it looked like a figure, but then you realize it was just something else?

Everyone has had that happen, and that is because your brain is being fooled. Recently, research shows that your brain assumes something when it looks like what you think of. For example, the pop icon, known as the ""Face of Mars,"" has fooled many scientists as NASA, making them believe that aliens were trying to give out signals. Unlike the other scientists, I believe that this ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform that looks similar to a human face.

First of all, I believe that this peculiar face was made from the winds on Mars. It is true that when erosion occurs on Earth, tiny sediments of rocks are moved away from the original rock. I believe that erosion also occurs on Mars because a rock that looks like a face does not show up all of the sudden. Also, as you can see in the picture Viking 1 photographed, you can see tiny holes on the forehead of this rock. It is my opinion that this rock was eroded at some time and started to form a figure of a face.

Secondly, the picture resolution of the rock was not as clear as it is today. So because of the resolution, the image looked similar to a human face.

Also, at the time of 1976, scientists still believed in the theory of aliens. However, about 22 years later, the workers at NASA captured the image of the rock again, but this time they used higher resolution. Then scientists were putting it all together by finding out that this rock was not a signal coming from Martians. So because of the resolution of the picture, the sceintists assumed that the rock came from aliens.

However, just because this face-like rock is from aliens doesn't mean that the theory of aliens isn't true.

There are still many beliefs that aliens exist. For example, in 1957, there was a group of aliens coming toward a farmer. However, they left Earth and there were no other signs of aliens from then. Then there was the flying saucer in the sky in 2013.

Many people assumed that it was a UFO, and there are still some research about that incident today. So even though that there was no sign of life on Mars, there has to be life somewhere out in the universe.

In conclusion, people still believe that the ""Face on Mars"" still came from aliens. Some people are like me, who believe that the rock was formed from erosion and that scientists didn't have the resolution at the time to figure out that it wasn't really a human face. Overall, the rock was just a mesa on Mars.",0,persuade_corpus,,0

In the passege ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", it states, ""The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"" The reson why the rock formation looks like a face could be from rocks being inside the sand to formate the face and the rocks could have shrunken or have gone away.

B3F18E671DF2,"I believe that deciding to lengthen school hours is not a good decision. From my personal experiences, I can tell that extending the amount of time spent at school would have a negative effect on the overall well-being and mental health of both students and teachers.

Similarly, teachers would be overworked and overstressed by having to teach during longer hours, leading to a decrease in the quality of their job performance.

Rather than extending school hours, I believe that it would be beneficial to re-evaluate the traditional curricular design and increase the amount of breaks during the day.

While i can tell what you are saying, I think that to have a B average to participate in sports is very unreasonable. As you may know an B in a very nice grade to achieve and maintain, but also it may be that most of the student body that participates in sport related activity's cannot achieve such goals. It may be just out of their reach or along ways away, but no matter, they should have the right to play sports just as they have the right to pass with a D average.

Most student who may be having troubles with there school work may not understand or be able to comprehend the material given to them. This is not completely their fault. The teachers should give a better explanation of the material to the students who are troubled.

Don't you think that the students with a C average are already stressed out enough? With all of the extra work they would have to do just to get the B that they need to participate in sports, they would most likely have the sleep they need deprived from them as they would need more time after the strenuous amount of homework given to study for up coming test and quiz's that they need to ace.

FF0FCC95E73F,"Dear State Senator ,

The idea of a Electoral College sounds great at first. In all reality you have to look at the facts. People of the United States should choose who they want to for president. Only having a few hundered out of the billions of people doesnt really seem fair to everyone's opinion, I agree that not everyone's opinion is satisfactory to others.

Each candidate running for President in a certain state has their own group of electors. These electors are chosen by the political party of those candidates running. The state laws get involved by only selecting electors by their responsiblilities. So this means not every elector is involved with the process.

We voters help choose our state's electors when we vote for President. When we vote for the person of our choice we are really choosing the electors in that candidate's political party. The ""winner-take-all"" system used in most states, gives the electors to the winning presidential candidate. this system is used in all states except Nebraska and Maine which have the variation of ""proportional repesentation."" The number of electors chosen for your vote will representing your chosen candidate.

Again with the fact of having a Electoral College, the people are not really voting for the President, they are voting for a slate of electors. Then they in turn elect president.

If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for 34 Democratic electors for Kerry. Off chance that those 34 electors won statewide, they would go to Congress and Kerry would in return get 34 electoral votes. These electors can be anyone not holding publice office. Electors have their own opinion rights as well.

Our votes dont always control who the elctors vote for. This causes confusion and arguements that it is unfair in the Electoral College's ways that the people are not always voting for their president because they are giving a slight chance for electors to change that vote.

Popular vote allows the people of the United States to choose what out of the majority is best for the United State's Presidential candidate. Unlike the rules and rights of the Electoral College, the popular vote allows the voters a absolute vote. Everyone's thoughts are put in concideration instead only 270 people out of like I said billions(and growing) population.

The facts show that popular vote in the long-run will be better for the United State's state of government than Electoral College. Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. We should abolish the electoral college.

With Concideration,

We sit down at the dinner table and do not talk with our families but our ""friends"" on social media.

Are take home projects for students over summer vacation necessary? Yes, students should be given some sort of summer project that corresponds with their class for the following year. students spend roughly eight months in school and once summer comes all the academic knowledge they acquired over the school year is lost the day they walk out the school doors. students should stay in some sort of school environment so they do not fall behind or lose as much prior knowledge about the subject. students could connect with their teachers for the next academic school year and receive their project from them, to turn in the first week of school.

Many students need the extra summer project to keep them in the flow of things. Some students don't need the extra project they are always in a school mindset and keep there grades up. However, that is not the case for every individual student. A summer project would be no ones favorite summer activity but, it would benefit students for their next academic school year. therefore, students would already be in school mode and be more prepared and less likely to fail a semester due to lack of knowledge.

Students should be able to come up with their own creative idea whether it be for a science project or an English essay. Student would be more prone to do their work if they could do their own topic. Students would do topics that they are interested in, maybe a sport they play or the history of a vehicle they like. But, when students receive a prompt or a project of any kind they are not as interested as they could be if it was their own topic. The topics could be submitted to the students teachers to be approved prior to summer and starting the work.

It is necessary for students to receive a take home project or essay over the summer. It will keep students on their feet and in a school like environment. It will also build responsibility, and let your teachers know how dedicated you are to school or how important it is to you. Students would also have something to do over the summer, because most students sit around at home and do nothing but play video games and watch television.

A6EE4F2D0C0C,"Bustling traffic fills every available lane on the highway on your drive home from work. It's rush hour again, and it's more of a slow, steady crawl rather than a drive. You can't roll the windows down to relax and get a breath of fresh air, because the air simply isn't appealing; It's all emissions from the other cars, and the smell of burning gasoline is simply naseauting. It's moments like this when you recall the stories in the news about cities all over the world limiting car usage, and wondering how useful or effective it really is. Banning the use of cars has advantages such as helping to reduce pollution, reducing stress, and conserving resources.

Pollution is a prominent problem in every society today, and often times you witness ""Go Green"" campaigns on the television, with celebrities trying to persuade you, and call you to action on trying to save the Earth. A great way to actually help reduce pollution, is through a ""No Driving"" campaign. In the document written by Robert Duffer, he discusses how Paris partially bans driving in order to ""clear the air of the global city."" A system was put in place that allowed drivers who only had odd numbered license plates to drive on Monday, and only even numbered plates the following day. This helped to reduce congestion on the streets, and reduce the smog polluting the air to a safer amount. Before this was put in place, it was said that ""[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author also discusses how ""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment..."" This is expressing how a lower percentage of car usage compares statistically to a lower percentage of carbon emissions in the air, which stresses a healthier environment. Maybe now we can roll down some windows while on the highway.

Stress is a major factor in everyone's life; It makes things difficult, wavers a person's focus, and isn't beneficial to your health in the slightest. These ""No Driving"" campaigns are actually helping to reduce the amount of stress in people, by giving them a chance to do some stress relieving activities, such as bike riding or rollerblading.  In the first source, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" which is also by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a mother of two and media trainer named Heidrun Walter stated ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walter was able to stroll on sidewalks and smell the fresh air, all while listen to the sounds of nature and children playing, free of the sound of cars. In Andrew Selsky's article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" Selsky informs the reader that Bogota makes renovations in the district on parks and sidewalks, so that during the time of ""No Cars,"" people have enjoyable options as to how to get around the city. With such dedication to a project, it would be surprising to not be satisfied with those results.

Non-renewable resources are what power our daily lives, from gasoline to coal, once it's gone, it's gone for good. With these campaigns to ban driving, we are helping to hold on to what we have, and in a way, realizing what we have before it becomes something we had. In the second article, Paris banned driving to reduce smog, which they blamed on the use of diesel fuel rather than gasoline. The use of diesel fuel may be helping to conserve gasoline, but it's used in Paris because of a tax on gasoline, and is simply a prefferable price. By not driving at all, the citizen reduced smog, and conserved their resources for another day. In Rosenthal's second article, she discusses how Bill Ford put forward a proposal on partnership, hoping to ""create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" With the conservation of non-renewable resources, we are helping to ensure a future for those who success our generations.

There are so many advantages to driving, like being able to travel long distances faster, and being able to carry things with you wherever you go, but they are advantages of circumstance, and ultimately the use of cars is a price we pay with our health. The advantages of using other forms of transportation outnumber the advantages of car usage, both in the health of the people, and the health of the planet. If not using cars can reduce stress levels in people, or reduce pollution in a matter of days in densely populated cities, or even conserve the resources we can't renew, we should have banned driving already!

47C2716D9C5E,"Do beleive in life on Mars? Many people do, they beleive that there is evidence to back up their theory. Such as the photograph, that was originally taken in 1976, of a rock that supposedly looks like a face. Though scientists know that the ""face"" is only a natural landform on Mars such as a rock.

The rock was photographed three times, in a place on Mars called Cydonia, the photgraphings were in , 1976, 1998, and 2001. Each time that picutre was taken it became more clear revealing that the ""face"" is simply a rock with many shadows. The shadows make the rock look like a face giving and illusion of a nose, eyes, and a mouth.

The photo was released to the public in 1976. This lead many people to believe that there really was life on mars. Many conspiracy theories formed. People believed now more than ever that life exsisted on Mars. Scientists knew this was false, it was merely a mesa, or rock.

Another photo was taken above Cydonia in 1998. This photo was taken by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) unlike that of the 1976 photo which was taken by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. This photo was ten times sharper than the original one. The picture provided even more evidence that ""face""

was nothing more than a natural landform.

Though not eveyone was satisfied because the photo had been taken during a cloudy time on Mars. People believed that alein markings were hidden behind the cloudy haziness of the planet. Therefore in the summer of 2001 the MGS snapped another photo of the ""face"". The camera could capture pyramids, small shacks, or airplanes because the image could capture objects 3 times bigger than the pixel size.

The image revelad no such evidence that life once occured on Mars.

Many people might still be skeptical of the ""face"", but there is not enough evidnece to back up life on Mars. The ""face"" is just another conspiracy of life. Scientists know that the ""face"" is only a rock, or other natural landfrom on mars.            ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
8DECBFDC0EB8,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the authors support to his knowledge of Venus is very informative. In the article the author provides information about the planet to inform the reader that even though it may be hard and risky that it'd be outstanding to be able to put humans on the planet, but because of it's ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"" or blazin temperatures no space craft or human are able to last on the planet without getting crushed or burned to crisps. Venus atmosperic pressure is 90 times greater than what us humans and living things experience on earth making it impossible for someone to last on the planet, with all of its cons many would rather admire from a view but some would rather get closer.

The evidence from the article that would make you want to avoid venus as much as it may seem nice and plesent the information provided would make you not want to put a foot on the ground of Venus. In the article it states that the planets weather consists of ""erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface"" not hospitable for any space craft nor human life.

Astronomers believe venus to have been ""covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" According the the knowledge of the article ""the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" stateting that Venus and Earth are and where once similar at a point in time. NASA believed to be coming up with multiple ways for humans to set foot on the planet without any complications, at the moment NASA's only way of getting near the planet with stable temperatures and pressure is by having a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.""

In conclusion the author puts into words that visiting Venus by foot seems impossible but by the rate of the technology and people willing to help with making it happen setting foot on Venus will be sooner than many believe.

975927254400,"My personal belief is that driverless cars should not be allowed on the roads. Driverless cars sound efficient and luxurious but they are really accidents waiting to happen. Many car companies that want to develop driverless cars talk about a world where no ever has to buy a car again because of this new and more efficient form of public transportation. This new form of public transportation would have many flaws due to humans not being in control of the vehicle such as accidents and malfunctions.

Google is one of the companies that want to get driverless cars out on the road to try and make the roads safer. But would that really make the roads safer or more dangerous? Google has tested driverless cars already and they stated,""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" My question is how does the car know when to alert the driver? Does it have sensors on the front of the car that detect traffic, and if so what if the sensors fail and the car continues to drive at a steady speed right into heavy traffic before the driver has time to react because he was relying on a car to alert him? The same goes for the car detecting roadwork or if a person is crossing the street or someone riding their bike falls into the road. There are too things that could go wrong on these cars to have them out on the road.

There are laws that prevent driverless ars being tested because the government believes that these cars are dangerous to pedestrians and other vehicles. If the government believes that these cars are too dangerous for the roads then why do certain companies want these cars to be on the roads? Car companies want these cars on the roads because they would be expensive to buy and they would make alot of profit if they where able to sell these types of vehicles. They are cars out now that have driverless features such as parallel parking and automatic breaking but these features have failed many times. Driverless cars are driven by computers which can malfunction like all computers do at one time or another.

My beliefs are that these cars should never be produced because they are nothing but a threat to pedestrians and other vehicles on the road. I agree with this sentance from paragraph nine,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver."". I agree with this because there are too many flaws with driverless cars. There are alot of things that can go wrong with humans driving cars but there are even more things that can go wrong with driverless cars.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

In this paragraph will be talking about the young man on his way to eroup Luke Bomberger. Some people say that it was dangerous but I say he did a heroic act by bring cattle and horses to war torn countries. Now we think why he did that for so long, it wasent money, fame, or even for himself. No he did that selfless act for those people who had nothing left after war war 2. If you ask thats why he did it to help those women, men, and children, of china germany italy and all sorts of places that were left in ruins.

In this paragraph will be talking about Luke's claims. Such as he knew it was an opprotunity of a life time. That is supported by parts of the story were he may have to work but has fun in between his hard work. Like when in italy he visits such places like Crete or the Acropolis. There were also bad times like when he fell of that slipery ladder and broke some of his ribs in a storm and almost fell over board if it wasent for a small metal bar holding him in.

For a second lets talk about the time he spent overseas. We look at the fun he had in his nine adventures. Such as when he first visted Greece. He went to the Acropolis, soon after he visited the Panama Canal. Those were just some of the places that he got to travel not includeing Venice or Crete or even China.

In the end all you can say about Luke Bombriger is that he tried to help people. He was so selfless that even broken ribs couldnt stop him form doing whats right. There are only words that can discribe his charachter, selfless, kind harted. The number one thing you can call him this and simply this human.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
DB8F7B150495," It's no secret that curfews are a common practice in many cities around the world. While some people argue that curfews unfairly interfere in young people's lives, the reality is that they can actually be quite beneficial. In this essay, we will explore the pros and cons of curfews and argue that, overall, they are a positive force in the lives of teenagers.

On the one hand, curfews can help keep teenagers out of trouble. By setting a specific time for teenagers to be home, curfews provide a clear boundary that can help prevent them from engaging in risky or dangerous behavior. For example, teenagers who are out late at night may be more likely to be involved in accidents, be targeted by criminals, or make poor decisions that could have long-term consequences.

Additionally, curfews can help teenagers develop a sense of responsibility and self-discipline. When teenagers are required to follow a curfew, they learn to manage their time effectively and prioritize their responsibilities. This can help them develop the skills they need to succeed in other areas of their lives, such as school and work.

However, some people argue that curfews are unfairly interfere in young people's lives. They argue that teenagers should be able to make their own decisions and that curfews can stifle their independence and individuality. While it's true that curfews can limit the amount of freedom that teenagers have, it's important to remember that this is a necessary sacrifice in order to keep them safe and help them develop into responsible adults.

In conclusion, curfews can be a valuable tool in helping teenagers stay out of trouble and develop a sense of responsibility and self-discipline. While they may limit the amount of freedom that teenagers have, the benefits of curfews far outweigh the costs. By setting clear boundaries and providing a structured environment, curfews can help teenagers grow up and prepare for a successful future.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

8A7081C962D7,"As an 8th grader, I think it would be really cool if businesses adopted a four-day work week with 10 hours of work per day. I mean, who doesn't love having an extra day off to do whatever they want? But, I also know that this could have some pretty big advantages and disadvantages, especially for students.

One of the biggest advantages is that students would have more time to focus on their schoolwork. With an extra day off, they could dedicate more time to studying and completing assignments, which could lead to better grades and better opportunities in the future. Plus, they could use the extra time to get involved in extracurricular activities or volunteer in their community, which could look great on college applications.

But, there are also some pretty big disadvantages to consider. For one, students might have a harder time balancing work and school. If they're working 10 hours a day, they might not have enough time to finish their homework or study for tests. And, if they're not careful, they could end up falling behind in their classes. Plus, they might not have as much time to hang out with their friends or pursue their hobbies, which could be really tough for some students.

Another thing to consider is how this could affect student preferences for elective schools. Some students might love the idea of having an extra day off, while others might prefer the traditional school schedule. It could be really hard to please everyone, and it might be hard to decide which students to prioritize.

Overall, I think that businesses adopting a four-day work week with 10 hours of work per day could have both really cool advantages and some pretty big disadvantages. It's definitely something to think about, but I'm not sure if it's something that would work for everyone.",1,llama2_chat,"Task:  Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of businesses adopting a four-day work week with 10 hours of work per day for students.

BA0DC6904621,"Missing out or being absent to a class can affect a student immensely. It could cause their grade to go down because he or she was absent. Many students are marked absent daily not because they are skipping school, but because they might be sick or even outside of the country for certain purposes. They could miss out on important learning material in a certain class. Some schools are starting to help out students by offering them a

Distance Learning program. This program allows students to attend classes from home through video conferences, or online. Many might say that with this program, students will become lazy and not attend school leading to a decline in student attendance. If you put it in a student's perspective, it will help them. Offering students an option to attend school from home through video conference is beneficial for them because now they will be caught up with the rest of the class, students can now stop worrying about missing work, and it will help students with illnesses or injuries that don't allow them to attend school.

Knowing the material that they are a teaching you in a class is very important. It can help you get a good score on the unit test, and on the final exam. This program can help those students who can't make it to school to catch up on the material that they have missed. The student can attend through a video conference or can find the material on the class page online. If a student still needs help, the teacher can then help the student when he or she next attends school. Students will now feel more confident and assured when it comes to a pop quiz, or the unit test.

When a student misses a class, they have missing work to complete. If students have the option to have a video conference at home to attend class, they can stop worrying about missing work. Many students have stress about missing work, and it is not healthy. Some might not even turn in the work because they feel discouraged to do it because they don't know how to.

With this program students will feel encouraged to at least try a problem on the worksheet. They will also know when to turn it in if it's a project. With that being said, students will feel more comfortable about missing work because they have the program to help them.

Another reason why this program is helpful is because it helps students who have an illness or an injury that forbids them to attend school. Some students do a sport after school and can suffer an injury. It could be a broken leg or a dislocated hip and that can make them be absent. With the program, the student can attend school from home and have the material that they are teaching on campus. It also helps students that are sick, they could have a severe illness that does not allow them to go to school. The

Distance Learning program will help them learn the material as well.

The

Distance Learning program helps out a lot of students because they are at the same pace as the rest of the class, they can feel less worried about missing work, and it will help students with illnesses or injuries that don't allow them to attend school. For students it is important to know what you are being taught because then you can ace your final exams. Being absent can affect your grades but with the help of the

Distance Learning program, you will be able to succeed in your academic career.                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

Well there is no life on mars. Well you might think diffrent but there are a ton of facts to prove there is not life on mars. So here are the facts to prove this thought

In the article ""Unmasking the Faces on Mars"" gives a picture of what apears to be a face, and that is what they thought until more studies show diffrent facts. ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, sanpping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2 when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the camras from a region of the red planet called Cybonia.""

Requiring at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities is wrong. Students can express themselves more freely if their life isn't just about schoolwork. Sometimes all a student needs is to take the pressure out of school or family by sports or other activities. Maybe a student has a C average even after you take away sports and any other activity.

Sports can also help someone get into shape. They allow us to exercise in a fun way. Also, it's not required to take, which takes the pressure of a grade away. Sports can also help us make new friends and may even provide us with a choice of a career. Either way, sports can benefit you and should not be requiring a certain grade average.

Other activities, like dance, cheer-leading, or photographer, can also benefit people. Some activities like dance can help us stay active while photography can help us socially. These activities give us a chance to hang out with friends and express ourselves in creative ways. Activities should also not be required by a certain grade average because they help us express ourselves in different ways.

Also, if the students feel strongly about their sport or activity, they might cheat to get the grade required for them to get back in. It might pressure them even more if you tell them they need a certain average. Taking away their activities and sports may also make them do worse in school because they are stressed out about grades.

These reasons show why I am against making students have a certain average to do sports or activities. Not letting students participate in activities and sports may stress they out. They will be less active and maybe even less social. You should not take aw",0,persuade_corpus,,9
5FB3B837BB81,"I support policy one because most teachers say school is so posed to be a fun way of learning. The principle should let the students use their phones but only at lunch and free times like policy one said. It sounds like a good idea but if a teacher takes away the cell phone during a class then the student should have to pay to get it back. The students should be glad if the principle allows policy one, because they get to at least use their phone without getting it taken away and having to pay for it. Also like for me instance I would rather have policy one because we get to use our phones at school in stead of not getting to use it at all for like seven hours. I enjoy school and so should other people but if we get to use our phones at lunch and at free times school should be a little more fun.

Policy one is the best policy for the middle schools and the high schools. Because like I said earlier school is and should be a fun way of learning. Also what if something happens at the school like at lunch if someone falls down and gets hurt and there's no one to contact their parents then policy one is the best policy for that situation. Policy two is just making schools boring like you should get use your cell phones at least at lunch because lunch is so posed to be a free time but if you can't use your cell phones then lunch isn't really fun. I mean like you have all your friends at lunch but sometimes your friends could get annoying like some of my are fun to talk to but sometimes they just like messing around with other people like just dising on other people. What if something happens to one of your family members and you can't use your cell then that's when policy one comes in and your family member was in a car crash or something then you won't get in trouble for using your phone at lunch because lunch is like a little break from school.

That's my opinion about policy one. Because policy one is the best policy for schools. Not only will the kids be happy but principle will be happy because the students. So that what I think about policy one and why schools should use policy one. Because like again school is so posed to be fun not boring.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
10E1C7EDACB8,"Firstly, I disagree because some kids around here may not have the money to do a sport, when you do a sport you have to buy the pants,shoes,the shirt everything that goes with that sport you'll need to buy for the activity or sport. But I do recommend trying to find something to do out of school so your not In your house all day long,but do something that you don't have to pay for, for example help out with a church group or ask people to walk there dogs stuff like that. Anyways i disagree most families out here in the real world don't have much money to spend money on everything your going to need for that activity that your going to do,now if you talk to the school or a teacher an tell them that you really would like to try this sport or this activity maybe they'll help you out with paying for the things but most of the time schools aren't very good with helping you with things like that.

Secondly, some kids may have to watch there brother or sister because there parents have to work or just maybe they only have one mom or just one dad. We never know what might happen if we leave them at their house by themselves. For example one time when I use to live In this big white house when I was younger my mom left to go work so I decide to go to a friends place that wasn't very far from my house so I left them there by themselves,my friend decide to pull up a stop sign but I wasn't involved someone saw her do it an called the cops on us,next thing you know the cops was there then I got in trouble because I've left my brother and sister at home with no one there to watch them. So thats why students should have a choice to not do a sport or a activity, so they don't have to leave their siblings at there house by themselves.

finally, most kids like sports and doing fun activities but I've known some kids and people that don't like to do sports or fun activities. The reason Is I've seen kids get Into big fights over who's going to go first an this an that,thats part of the reason some kids don't get out much to do things but the other reason Is maybe they feel like they'll get judge by what they look like or how they dress trust me i understand that problem. The other thing is sometimes kids have to get a job to help pay bills and get food on the table because there mother Isn't making much money so they have to go get a job and help there mother with stuff they need. People all around the world have to do these things It's sad that they have to but they got to do what they have to do. So that Is why i disagree students should have a say In this to not just the principal.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
C1C75CB3BB17,"Hey, I'm like, totally stoked to be writing this essay! 😃 As an 8th grader, I think it's totally fair to say that students with a grade C average or higher should be allowed to play sports. Like, think about it, sports are super fun and they can actually help us do better in school! 🤯

First of all, playing sports can help us get more exercise. We all know that exercise is good for our bodies and minds, right? It can help us stay focused and energized during class, and it can even improve our grades! 📚 Plus, being active can help us feel more confident and comfortable in our own skin, which can totally boost our self-esteem. And who doesn't want to feel good about themselves? 😊

But that's not all! Playing sports can also teach us important life skills, like teamwork and communication. When we're on a sports team, we have to work together to achieve a common goal, and we have to listen to our coaches and teammates. This can help us learn how to work together and support each other, which is super important in school too! 🤝 And, let's be real, sports are a great way to make new friends and be part of a community. 👫

Now, I know some people might be like, ""But what about the academic impact? Won't playing sports distract us from our studies?"" And to that, I say, ""Nah, dude! 😜 Playing sports can actually help us do better in school!"" When we're active and engaged in something we love, it can help us focus better in class and stay motivated to learn. Plus, sports can teach us important skills like time management and goal-setting, which can totally help us succeed in school. 📚🏆

So, in conclusion, students with a grade C average or higher should totally be allowed to play sports! It's not only fun and beneficial for our bodies and minds, but it can also help us do better in school. 💪🏼📚 So, let's get out there and start playing some sports!",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

Over the years many people have complained that voting for a president of the united states is unfair. That they fell that someting should be done to change the voting system. In the articals given to me i have read some resons to keep it and to abolish it. In source one the electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers astablished it in the constitution as a compromise between elections. For the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors but if a majority is 270 electoral votes. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for pourposes of the electoral college. You are choosing an electors when you vote for president because when you vote for a canidate u a really voting for your candidate's electors. There are some little things that need to be done to fix it a little like fir example the part thats stats that smaller states have barly no power and that most presedents dont even wory about then becuse they don't make muche of a difrance. Each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarly betrayed). The other problen that is with this system is that the winer takes all when the are may poeple that vote for ether for the republican or democratic if the oponunt has more votes they won all the electors and the oponunt does not get any votes from that state so its like you didin't even vote. If it was up to me to keep the electoral callege system i would say yes but they just have to make some few changes.

CA3937072A24,"I think that policy 1 is the better choice, because the students are going to bring their phones to school no matter what. If you let us bring our phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free periods the students wouldn't have to sneak around and text people during class. Some people might take advantage of this and use the phones all day long but, you would just have to punish them and let the rest of us use them in free periods. The school will then get more respect and the teachers could teach their class without any distractions and cellular devices going off in class. If you would consider that policy the students would admire you in ways you can` t seem to understand. Giving students the opportunity to carry their cellular devices is giving them responsibility and telling them that you can trust them to do the right things in class and pay attention to the class.

To prevent the students from texting in class the teachers should also put bens or cubbies to hold all cellular devices. That would restrain the students to look at texts from their friends. If you tell students not to bring their cellular devices to school they are going to bring them any way or the other just to see what you are going to do about it. The mind of a teenager is if you tell us not to do something we are going to do it anyways just to see what's going to happen if we do it. If nothing happens we will continuously keep doing it and will eventually start using the phones in class and wherever we want and when we want to.

What i` m trying to say is that if you tell a student not to bring a phone to school is like telling a teacher not to teach on a subject that contains the lesson that the class will be learning for the week. So, you should really consider having the first policy.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Althoe there are some reasons why the Electoral college should change. Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, and plenty of oothers think that it should change because according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortlyafer Al Gore he wonn the popular vote but lost the presidency dur to the quirks of the electoral college. in the Electoral College system people vote not for the prresident but for a slate of electors as i had said in the last pargrraph who in turn elect or the president. electors could be anyon not holding public office. voters sometimes control who there electors vote for. wich makes the voters sometimes get confsed about the electors wich makes them vote for the wrong candidate.

B2DAE4CC6597,"Attending school is the traditional way for students to further their education, but with advancements in technology, distance learning and “school at home” programs are becoming increasingly popular. These programs allow students to keep up with their studies without leaving the comfort of their homes, but there are several pros and cons to consider regarding each option.

One of the main benefits to traditional school is the development of social skills. Students gain valuable life experiences from meeting and interacting with other classmates. They also learn to work together to complete group projects, develop communication skills, and gain essential life lessons. At home, these opportunities do not always present themselves as easily, and a student’s overall development of skills may be affected.

The traditional school system also prepares students for their adult lives. Schools offer resources such as guidance counselors, college prep classes, and résumé and job skills workshops. Students gain technical information from lectures and textbooks, but the one-on-one interaction and collaboration are what truly prepares them for the real world.

For students that are motivated, organized, and independent learners, “school at home” or distance learning programs are a great option, but it is not the right fit for everyone.

The community is in which the place you live, love, respect. So you should not think of it as giving to, but as giving back.

Texting while driving is the more dangerous than talking while driving. You take your eyes off the road for one minute and boom you've gotten into a wreck.

Most of the drivers that fall into this category are teens. These drivers have the highest fatalities behind the wheel due to using a phone. In the state of Utah using your phone behind the wheel , and you cause an accident it can land you in jail for up to 15 years. Most teens use airpods made by Apple inc, instead of holding the phone in there hand. This is even more dangerous because you can't hear your surroundings.

In conclusion: if people continue to use there cellular devices behind the wheel he number of casualties on the roads they will continue to increase.. It is the people's responsibility to not put their own and others people lives at risk due to there horrible actions.                          ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
8415937CA4D9," I believe that a homework club would be an excellent addition to our school. Many students struggle with certain subjects, such as math or science, and would greatly benefit from additional help. With a homework club, students would have the opportunity to receive extra assistance from teachers and peers, which could help them better understand the material and improve their grades.

Teachers are often willing to provide additional support, but some students may feel uncomfortable asking for help. A homework club would provide a more structured and comfortable environment for students to seek assistance. Additionally, the club could offer a variety of resources and materials to aid students in their studies.

While there may be some potential drawbacks to consider, such as the time and energy required to teach slower learners, I believe that these challenges could be overcome with careful planning and effective communication. Furthermore, many students have after-school activities and may arrive late to their commitments, so it may be necessary to offer flexible scheduling options for the homework club.

One potential issue could be a lack of volunteers to lead the club. However, I believe that with some outreach and promotion, it may be possible to find enough teachers and other volunteers to support the club. Additionally, the club could be run as a rotating leadership model, with different teachers or volunteers leading the club on a weekly or monthly basis.

Overall, I believe that a homework club would be a valuable addition to our school. It would provide students with the support and resources they need to succeed academically, while also promoting mental health and well-being.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

7E1386249DA8,"Dear principal,

I think that the students at our school should be required to do community service.

It is a very positive way to get us to engage in our community.

It's a great way to help our society, it makes others happy, and it sets a good example for others.

Firstly, it's a great way to help our society.

One way to help is cleaning up the side of the road.

By doing this, the walkways are clearer and it looks better.

It might be a big task for one or two people, but if everyone helps out, it will be done in no time.

It only takes a little bit of help to make our community a better place to live.

Secondly, doing community service makes others happy.

For example, we could tutor elementary school children.

It won't be hard for us since we already know the stuff they are learning.

It also makes them happy because it makes them feel smart, so they won't get stressed out and have a tantrum.

They will receive better grades which will make their parents proud of them.

You could also help run a daycare for little kids.

It would make the person running it very happy since he/she won't have to do it by themselves.

Lastly, it sets a good example for others.

If we do community service which makes our community happier and cleaner, others who think it's stupid will want to help.

If everyone is doing it, surely others will want to join so they won't feel left out.

If we want to set a good example for our peers, we should start as soon as possible.

In conclusion, making community service a requirement, will help our society, make others happy, and set a great example for others.

With all this put together, we could live in a better and happier place for everyone.

It only takes a few to start something big, so why not start now?

7F697EF803C9,"Some schools today require projects over the summer break to ensure they still remember about the subjects they were taught the previous semester. But should these projects be designed by the student to make the project more enjoyable? Or should they be teacher designed to make sure they meet the criteria needed? Well, students should be given a break during the summer because that is what is is all about and it is a time to relax and enjoy the weather. So I would have to say that students, if required to do the project, should design the summer project. here is why I believe that they should.

Students will be more interested to the project if they got to assign it, because the average student today will most likely forget or just rather enjoy their break. If they were able to design it the way they want to, then they can enjoy project a lot more. There will be some students that still won't do the project, but they were not going to do the project either way weather the student nor' teacher designed the project. But if the student designed the project, then a higher percentage of students will actually do it.

Student designing the project can be a benefit of there own. How can it be a benefit? Well, when the students come together they can explore each others ideas and thoughts about a subject. They can listen to each other and it can be a great way to build on their listing and social skills with the added fact that the can come up with new and brilliant ideas that can be more relevant and unique than a single teacher. Students can also learn more about each other with this exercise and become relatively close with one another.

In lower grade levels such as, second grade to seventh grade, most just get their parents do it. I know about this occurring because in my fourth grade year there were about 32 kids in my classroom, and every project that was assigned to us, every kid had their parents do the project for them. So, kids today havent changed and the project will be irrelevant to them. But if the students make one, then this could limit the project strictly to the student in a way that the parent could not understand the project, therefore unable to do the project for them.

In conclusion, weather the students designed the project or the teacher. Students can have many more benefits than a teacher would. From having a more enjoyable time, to being more effective to the students education. Parents would have to be involved and the student can learn new things without even knowing about it.

I hope this brought a new light to the subject and to influence you to see both sides of the argument.

D0050F9D9621,"Students across the nation often spend their year day dreaming about the summer break, but when they are assigned summer assignments by their teachers, their dreams may feel crushed. Teachers are mostly the ones that create these assignments, but is that the best way to do it? If students were able to design their own summer assignments it might just take some of the weight off their shoulders while completing it. Summer assignments should be student-designed because it will motivate them to complete it, encourage them to be creative, and cater to the minds of the students.

If the students are the ones creating their project, they would be more motivated to complete it. When kids are having fun over the summer they do not usually stop and think about their school work, but if they were to design it, it may spark more interest for them. Students putting their own personal touch on to their assignment would make it less like work and more like fun. Teachers often assign large packets full of information, but by doing so, their students will procrastinate this long chore. Students are more likely to create an interactive and less detail packed assignment. Summer is a time for students to have a break from school, and when they get to make their projects themselves, it makes them not feel burdened about completing it.

When kids are given the task of designing themselves a summer project, they will most likely think more creatively than their teachers. Younger people are known to have a better creativity than their older counterparts. When students collaborate, their minds all put together should create a very interesting outcome. Their ideas would likely be more interactive than information driven. With more interactive projects, kids would also be creative while completing the project. Creativity increases effort which results in better grades. Teachers may think that their content filled assignments will benefit their students academics, but the truth is that kids need room for creativity in order to absorb information.

Perhaps the most important reason students should design their summer assignments is because it would cater to their own minds. The students are the ones that are completing these assignments, so they should know what is best for them. Students know what kinds of assignments weigh them down and which don't. They would create projects that a relevant to their lives. Teachers were all students at one point, but times change very quickly. What was once helpful to a teacher, may no longer be helpful for student in the present. A student-designed project would be made with their best interests in mind. Kids will design their projects to what fits best for them over the summer.

All in all, students should design their own summer assignments because they will be more likely to complete it, they would put more thought into it, and they know what is best for themselves. Teacher-designed projects may have quality information, but students are not often inclined to do heavy work loads over the summer. Since students are the ones that have to complete their projects, they should be the one that design it. ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

You often hear people say that teenagers are costing more problem to other people and for the around them environment. The city council should adoption the 10 p. m midnight curfew for teenagers because teens would stay out of problems, and they would have more time to do school work.

To start, the curfew would avoid teenagers being in problem with the law. For example,teens with the curfew would not be in gangs or cost problem to others. Lets say that teens had the curfew it would expand beyond the level of doing good to others and staying out of gangs or doing bad stuff. They would be able to achieve their goals fast and force on what is next in life. Even though, this curfew sounds bad its not bad because teens would learn that the curfew is just to help them and help the environment around them.

Secondly, the curfew would allow teens with more time on their schools work and have time to force on their work. For example, teens would have more time to focus on their schools work than being on the streets with gangs. With that being said teens would have a chance of achieving their dreams and being successful in live without a bad influences. In this scenario, it show that a curfew is not bad because it has some good way in live and it allow people to do good stuff for others. Ultimately, with this curfew it allows young people to see the better side in life and it would help them to stay focus in schools by achieving their work and doing the right things.

Some people may say that having a curfew is unfairly interfere in young people lives. For example, young people have the right to choose the way they want to be. Therefor, being later in night dose not meant that young people are doing bad stuff or their are in gangs also they are just having fun in their way. Thus, being in a curfew it show young people that their are controlling by other people just because they have a different way of having fun. In this scenario, it show that having a curfew is just unfairly for teenagers just because other teens got in trouble it dose not means that all of the young people needs to have a curfew.

In conclusion, the city council would just being helpful to the young people by add a time limit. And it would help the environment around them and it would give more time and focus to the young people. All in all, it is a good thing to put a curfew because teens would have more time to spent with their family and doing good stuff for the environment.",0,original_moth,Task: Research and write an essay about long-term effects that the city council's adoption of a 10 p.m. weekday and midnight weekend curfew for teenagers would have.

13AAAD860217,"As we get older there are more things we want to acomplish. Taking home classes doesn't always benefit students because the social enviroment is not being developed in a possitive way. Although, some students will feel more comfortable if they recieve distance classes and have video conferences online because whether they are not prepared to atttend to a regular school or they just don't like other students. It is true that being expossed to interact with other students can sometimes be tough, but having the opportunity to learn from a regular school can also be benefitial and some ways attending to school can helps us learn better than taking home classes are having a profesional teacher, meeting new people, and able to show leadership.

First of all, we can find a lot of stuff online now a days, but there is when the issue starts. Not having someone to explain and provide specific information can be difficult in our path of learning. An example from my experience could be when I was still living in Mexico and I had to recieve English classes at home, but the online resources weren't the best ones to learn from. However, when I moved to the U.S., I started going to a regular school and it was easier for me to get along with the English language because the teachers helped me having a better understanding of what it was about and how to overcome in a short period of time.

Another way that attending to a shool can be benefitial is, getting to know new people. As it has been said, becoming a teeneger leads us to want to afford new things. Meeting other students is so helpful because our social enviroment is increasing and the chances to succeed are maximied. In my case, interacting with other students helped me create a better social background and grow in a high standar community as well as having friend because friendships are essential in a teeneger life.

Additionally, being able to show leadership can help our selves as well as others. At a certain moment, most of the teenegers have to go to college and it is difficult to get accepted in because many of the colleges in the U.S. want students that are capleble to maintain in a possition to represent them in their community. For example, from my school there are a lot of after school activities as well as clubs where we can share important information of what is going on in school and out of school. They also prepared us to know how to talk in front of others and without a doubt clarify why we are standing there. This is what most of the universities want to see from a reguar high school student that attends to a regular school.

As shown above, creating new opportinities to grow in our learning skills can be found in a school. Which it is a more possible way to acomplish our goals, rather than being at home without a light of success. In fact, having the opportunity to stablish a stable learning growth it's not something that can be dissmissed because attending to a school can be helpful in ways such as having a profesional teacher, meeting new people, and able to show leadership. Once we take the step of taking classes in a school, rather than taking online classes at home, our lives will be easier.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
B6E9E12159E3,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. I think they ask more than one person for advice because other people can speak there opinion and give the person who wants advice some ideas.

They all said golden and blue would be a good theme for her party. Generic_Name takes there ideas. Generic_Name is now having her party golden and blue!

I also think people ask more than one other person because sometimes people don't have ideas of something they need help with. Some people need a better choice, so its better to ask other people then just think of your own ideas because hearing other people's thoughts can make your ideas better. I think people should always give at least another person's thoughts on what they need help with. It is always best to get another persons idea. It can make the person who needs the advice to gain some confidence on what they need advice on.

3741469BB646,"Is online school the best way for students to learn in this generation? Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. By giving students this option they will continue their schooling through being home schooled. Many parents would most likely have their students take an online class especially if their student is a student who plays sports. I think students should refrain themselves from taking online classes because they could have a lack of focus, if they need help in a subject they can consult their friends or a teacher in person, and they would be better off working in a class setting.

In a general class the max of a high school class is about 30 students. If you're a student who likes to focus in a smaller class they can always make arrangements. Working in a classroom can help you stay in check and prevent you from losing focus. There are so many distractions that can come towards taking an online course. You could be persuaded into watching t. v or playing video games. With that being said, you would have to set a lot of ground rules for yourself to prevent you from falling into those temptations.

Many students tend to find subjects that they are taking very difficult, but that shouldn't discourage them in asking for help. That is the bright side of taking classes in school, because you will always have people to help you. Having that one on one communication with a teacher, in person, is the best way to help. You can never go wrong with communicating with a teacher or a friend. Being able to sit and listen to ways that can give you a better understanding on something you don't understand is a great way on getting better.

Working in a class setting would be better off than online. With a class setting, students can work on their assignments hands on. In that way, the students are familiar with the source and can help them to remember in case they would ever need it again. Also, you wouldn't have to worry about working on assignments by yourself, because you will always have others to help if needed. Although there are benefits of working one on one communication with an online teacher, being that you will always have that teacher there for yourself, a student will not get the same learning skills as they wold in a class setting.

Overall parents and students should communicate within themselves to see which area would be best for their students. When it comes to school and sports there should always be a balance and not one way out. Online school might be tempting to take, but there's nothing better than taking classes in a school. There are also many source if you are having trouble rather that would be with online databases or teacher/student help. There is always a better way to strengthen your education. Taking courses in school is the way to go. Be ready to see your friends and teachers in person everyday! ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

It has been a numerous numbers of crashes while people have been driving and on a cellphone. Some people might feel that driving while on cellphone is okay, but it has been reported to be illegal. Overall using a cellphone increases driver's risk of causing a crash or death to a family, or person. Driver's are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more crashes.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not just yourself. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cellphones whether they want to or not. Driving is a privilege and some people take it for granted.

Driving you have to be very careful for yourself and for other drivers.

Dear, Mr Generic_Name. I am a student who is in attendance at your high school, writhing to you about the changing of our school menu. I for one think it's a grate idea to change our school menu into a much healthier one.

Our current school menu has its redeeming qualities, but it also has a few lose ends. For example; they serve things like pizza, burgers, rice with chicken, nachos, spaghetti, Pb&j , and salad. Do you see the problem with the food items listed above? 99% of the schools menu contain high levels of fat and carbohydrates, which is not a proper meal for a growing student, or any human being. I remember seeing posters like the food pyramid, posted on the lunch room walls of my middle and elementary schools, but not once did the school lunches follow that expatiation. This is the problem with the school menus all over America today, they serve fatty foods filled with carbohydrates and not enough protein, fibers, and good fats.

As growing students, we need food that'll give us energy through out the day, and keep us focused in our classes, but the current menu isn't serving us the food we need; don't get me wrong, they have things like fruits, vegetables, and other good side options, but that's not enough. We need the main meal/ main dish to be the most healthiest thing on our trays, not the side dishes.

The students at our school may be disappointed with the sudden change in the school menu, but they'll just have to adjust to a healthier menu. It'll be nice if the school menu items was a bit more healthier, but the side options must stay the same. The side options our school menu currently have are just fine; they meet the expatiation's of a healthy side option; the offer fruits vegetables and the occasional desert.

The health of your students and my peers are important, and a big part of being healthy starts with what you put in your body, so please continue with the plan of changing the school menu, our future self's will deeply appreciate it. Thank you for our time.

8AA34A4C8BEA,"Imagine you are riding in a driverless car and you see a bright red car heading toward you. Would you panic? Or would you go on as if nothing was going to happen? Imagine having very little control of your car when it crashes into the red car that was coming towards you. Imagine finding out that you had just killed two precious, little babies lives because your driverless car lost control. These are the things that you have to think about when it comes to driverless cars. I believe that diverless cars are not completely safe. I think they should be illegal for many reasons.

Vehicles have mechanical problems all the time. You will be driving down the road and your breaks will go out, or your steering wheel will lock up. These things are hard enough to control when the driver is in control of the car, let alone if the driver was not fully in control. In section seven, it says that the driverless cars are able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. What happens when you are riding along and something goes completely wrong and you end up crashing into the car that was heading your way? Driverless cars would only exacerbate the mechanical problems cars have today. In section nine it says that if the car fails, and someone is injured, who is responsible? The driver or the manufacturer?

Safety is a big issue when it comes to driving. One of the main issues is texting and driving. If you are the designated ""driver"" in a driverless car, you would be even more tempted to get on your phone. I believe that this is not safe at all. If you are in the drivers seat, you need to be paying attention to the road at all times, even in a driverless car. In section eight in the passage, it says that some maufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. I think that having these ammentities in the car are very unsafe. Even though the cars have been tested and have been driven more than a half a million miles without crashing according to section two, there are still possibilities for mishaps and crashes. Because of this, section nine says that in most states it is illegal to even test computer driven cars.

Safety is not the only issue when it comes to driverless cars. Owning a driverless car would be extremely expensive. As I said earlier, mechanical failuers happen all the time in cars today. The cost to fix your car when something happens is already expenxive. If you were to own a driverless car and something happened to fail, the cost would most likely be exorbitant. Driverless cars have so many features and sensors. In section four, it says that there are sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. If one of these sensors were to go bad or to break, it would be costly to fix them.

Overall, I thik that driverless cars should not be legal. They put too many things and people at risk. Even though they have been tested and proven to be safe, there are still many things that could go wrong. In section seven, it says that they are able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. If you believe these things to be true and you get in the car without a care in the world, you will not be filled with much exhilaration when something goes wrong. The issue of driverless cars and safety is a big problem to me. When you are in a car that you do not have to pay attention to the road very much, you could be doing whatever you wanted. Even if you were paying attention to the road and your surroundings, you never know what other drivers are doing. Not being in control of the car can be very dangerous no matter what situation you are in. ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

Then the students can talk to there friends to see what has been going and to see if they want to meet somewhere for they can talk and to see what they have been doing all day and see if they had a good day or a bad day in school so far. so that's what they should do because they students are hurting the class time and there education so why not there still following along in class there still learning and what need to know about what was going on in this world. and learn every thing they need to know . plus if do not then buddies they might tell them what they want to them but they don't they might not following along in class because there wondering about there going to say during and not follow along.

0EE6F614F2F0,"Have you struggled and asked someone to help? People often do this to search for the answer or an alternative. Seeking more than one opinion can provide someone with better choices because it gives them a new perspective and can better themselves.

One way multiple opinions helps to get better choices is gaining a new perspective. First, someone with the help of others can find out new and improved ways to solve the problem. A new way to solve can lead to a completely new and beneficial solution. This can result into the right choice to make. Secondly, someone who knows more than you about a subject can reinforce their idea, so the opinion seems better and more reliable. For example, if someone asked an old science professor about the parts of a plant cell, the professor will be able to answer that question confidently and reliably because they've been teaching science for a long time. This proves that getting an professional opinion can help others with their choices. Thirdly, peers could influence perspective and help with better choices. Others often trust a close and helpful friend rather than a random person. Overall, looking at a new perspective can better someone's choices by finding a new solution, getting professional guidance, and gaining the help of fellow peers.

Another way of improving the choices others make is to strengthening themselves by listening to others. People can improve themselves and the choices they make by listening to constructive criticism and feedback. For instance, I asked people to review my project and I was told some feedback. I learned from that experience, improved my abilities and I now make the right choices when I work on projects. Not to mention, people can help make better choices by getting emotional support from others. Someone could be going through a rough time and not making the best choices, but they can search for multiple view points from others. This can result in people helping that person out and leading them to conduct better choices. Lastly, people can help make improved choices by gaining motivation. Motivation from others could help someone keep pushing forward and make correct choices, so that they can improve and learn. In conclusion, getting multiple opinions can improve someones choices by listing to feedback and criticism, getting emotional support, and gaining motivation.

Getting a lot of ideas and opinions can give someone better choices and opportunities because it gives a fresh view point and can improve ones self. People consult other people to find better choices and in doing so, usually benefits the people involved. All in all, an open perspective and improvement in themselves is why gaining multiple opinions helps result in good choices.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
F0095A6449E9,"The use of the techonology is not valuable in a classroom because students may not want anyone to know how they feel. Students should be able to keep their emotions to themselves if they do not wish to share them. Students shouldnt have to walk in class and automatically tell a teacher or a peer how they feel because their emotions are already known. Emotions are something a student might not want to share because they might be going throught something personal thry dont want anyone to know about. In paragraph three Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" then later on in the paragraph he says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotion and communication..."" So if humans don't communicate their feelings to eachother then they probably don't want a computer to communicate them. Some people may say that that would be a good thing for students because it might help them open up more, but it would just force them to say how they feel because their emotions are already known. Emotions should be privite unless the person wants to share them. Students shouldn't be forced to share their emotions because a computer is there caculating them for everyone to see.

11F4FD622FD8,"The Facial Action Coding System is a very useful tool used to help tell what other peoples emotions are just by their facial expresions. Having this technology can be very helpful in the classrom. It can help define the mixed emotions of a student, how they feel of a topic they are learning, and if a student is telling the truth.

The first reason as to why this technology is useful in the classroom is defineing the mixed emotions of students. In the artical it says ""The software can even identify mixed emotions"" (paragraph 4). Being able to identify mixed emotions of a student can be helpful. Sometimes a student may be stressed and upset over something, making it hard for them to concentrate on their work. You can't just let them not work though, but knowing their feelings you may be able to take it more slow paced for them that day. The student may have felt angry and stressed before they came into class, explaining why they got so upset when they couldn't find their homework.

Another reason this would be useful in class is by defining how they feel about a topic in class. In this article it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson"" (paragraph 6). Having this tool say when they are confused is extraemly helpful. It lets the teacher know they may need some extra help, and the computer know to explain things in a different way. When a student becoms bored of what they are doing it becomes hard for them to concentrate, or causes them to want to rush through.

The final reason Facial Action Coding Systems should be in classrooms is because it can help tell when a student is lying. In paragraph 8 of the article it says ""Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politcian or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This can help a teacher know when an anxious student needs help, but says they don't. Some students may be too anxious to actually speak up when they need help, causing them to lie when a teacher ask them if they do. This also comes in handy when a student has done something and no one knows who it was, like tearing down a poster or putting a tac on the teachers seat.

In conclusion, this technology would be very useful for classrooms to define a students emotions to improve work, help a confused or bored student, and spot out lairs.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
DA1C7D2E4652,"Now trust me I know projects are not exciting and having them in the summer sounds terrible, but what if I told you having summer projects could be fun. If you got to pick who designed your summer projects who would you pick: teacher-designed or student-designed? Having student-designed projects is so unique and a great way to make projects more interesting. How about we switch it up a bit and instead of teachers creating the projects students do. Making summer projects student-designed would make it stress free on students, give them freedom, and it would make learning fun.

I'm currently a high school student, so trust me I know how stressful school projects can be. If students designed these summer projects all the stress would go away. You would get to do the project on your own time and you'd get to pick what you want to learn about. Students wouldn't make the projects super hard or long because it is summer break and that's their time to relax. A teacher would normally give you a rubric or a set of guidelines you have to follow, but now you get to make it how you want.

The possibilities are so endless if students got to build summer projects. You'd be able to pick how you want to do things and you could really bring out your creative side. It's the students break, this is when they don't want to think about school, so they should be able to decide whats best for them. You wouldn't have a list of things you need to follow you would be able to do whatever you wanted to. This would be such a great opportunity for students to enjoy learning and make it interesting.

I know I've definitely gotten a topic to research about and it wasn't interesting to me at all. Having to do a project on something you find boring won't give you the motivation you'd need to push through it. If students got to pick what they wanted to learn, they wouldn't mind having these projects during summer break. Finding something to learn about that really interests you would make the experience as a whole ten times better. Maybe you're doing a poster on something you learned about in history, you get to enjoy learning about it and make that poster however you want to.

Student-designed summer projects overall sound like something that would satisfy every student. Having teacher-designed projects would most likely be more organized and efficient, but students would have more fun and enjoy learning if it was student designed. Lets make learning over summer break something everyone would enjoy while also being able to relax. In conclusion, letting students create their own summer projects would give them the break they deserve, but to also assure they are still learning. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

In the passage it also states that ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This technology could help teacher's drastically with figuring out what lessons students are struggling the most with and what they can change to make there lessons slightly easier and more effective. F.A.C.S technology could not only possiably help improve students grades and comprehension of the material they are learning, but also help in my personal opinion could drastically with school shootings. If the teachers had the Facial Action Coding System in their classroom's then they could possiably save a child's life. Being able to see if a child/student is depressed or not could greatly benefit the saftey of schools. It could also help teachers recognize that a student in their class is struggling and they can get the student/students the proper help they need, which could possibly help prevent a student from taking their own life. In conclusion, the use of the Facial Action Coding System technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable because it could help teachers get students who may be depression, the proper help they need which could possibly prevent a child from taking their own life. The technology could help teachers see if a student in their classroom is forcing a ""fake"" smile to hide that they are upset, anxious, worried, depressed, etc. Or if te student is truly happy and has a genuine smile. This technology could greatly possibly help techers learn what they need to spend more time working on in the classroom. This could also help the teachers learn what they could modify in their lesson plans to make them slightly easier for there students. With this is in mind, the F.A.C.S tecnology use in the classroom could ultimately help not only the students but the teachers, paraprofessionals, subsitute teachers, etc. It could help improve students test scores and overall learning environment.

BA7FDE49E357,"The main advantages to limiting car usage would be less accedents and less polution. People dont really know about how many accedents and how much polution cars are responsible for.

to start off with cars can make you very tense and then posibly resulting in a crash. Without cars people would be less tense and be calm every day as they go to work. For example Heidrun Walter said "" When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. "" In the outskirts of freiburg street parking, drive ways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely car free except for the main thoroghfare. Freiburg does allow car ownership but there are only two places to park, large garrages at the edge of the develoupment, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. As a result 70% of the people do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to be able to live there. People now walk, take the tram, or ride bicycles to school and work, and yet these people are very happy about it. Planes are now taking this concept to the suburbs. They are doing this by putting new building walking distance from those people insted of the malls were people have to drive in order to get there.

in addition to people being less tense banning cars would result in less polution.  Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. After five days of smog rivaled china which is one of the most poluted cities of the world. Diesels were the blame. But finally on monday the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescid the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuseday. This ban also went on to Colombia for three years they have been doing this and they only allow buses and taxies everyone else  gets a $25 fine. Eventually two other colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event. kids now are not even wanting to get a drivers license they would rather walk. these kids get their jobs by looking at the ones that are in walking distance. this is a very good thing because the less drivers the less pollution there is in the air.

in conclusion if we limited the usage of cars people would be more relaxed and there would be less polution in the air pluss people would be gatting exercise so people would benifit from this and our world would be much cleaner.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

People also think that it is a bad idea graduate from high school in three years because they said that is to early, and you don't going to be smart enough to be successful in life but I said "" that's wrong because we still have to go to summer school and take extra classes in summer school and you have to be very smart because you need to pass all you classes you cannot fail any class because if you fail one you need to take it in summer school again and that's going to be a problem so if you want to graduate early you also have to take classes online so you're going to be very busy so they should be ready for the next level.

I know someone that he is from Dominican Republic but he leaves in Generic_City, I went to one of his barbershop and i ask him

"" what did you do to be so successful? he told me this "" when i was 16 years old I graduate from high school' then i ask ""how you graduate so early and he told me that he take classes in summer school and he take classes online"" i said that' s good ""keep telling me how you became succesfull "" and he told me that after he graduate he went to college to take classes the barbershop 3 years later he was only 19 years old so he have to work for one year if he want to open his own busyness then after that he open three barbershops in Generic_City he said if you put you best effort to the thing you, and life going to get better everything.

Another thing is that not everybody make it,

is hard but i have i tip for those type of people never give up just do you best and put you hurt to it and put you best effort because at the and your mom and dad don't going to be there to pay for you food you going to be the man in that house so that's why everybody need to work hard everyday if they one to be successful in life.

9921880270E3,"Have you every though about seeking advice form different people. Seeking advice is a great thing to do and is very helpful. Asking different people for advice helps you get multiple opinions. Getting multiple opinions by seeking advice from different people helps them, because it helps get a better result, helps see the pro and cons of one persons advice, and makes the person which is asking confident.

Asking more than one person for advice and getting multiple opinions helps you make a wise choice. About 50% of the population ends up choosing or making the right choice. Once my father told me a story about seeking help form others. He told me a story about him seeking help to solve his problem. He said that he asked multiple people for advice and told me how that helped him make and do the right thing. The lesson is that by asking more than one Person to solve your issue helps by resulting you making the right choice.

Having multiple opinions form different people helps you see the pros and cons about ones advice. By comparing one persons advice with other peoples advice helps you see the pro and cons. Seeing the pro and cons of one persons advice helps you see how wrong they are. About 75 % of people around the world resulted doing a terrible thing, however, 25% people survived by seeking advice form different people. My mom is one of those lucky people who survived, and now she is willing to help others. My mom told me that she used to only ask advice form her friend Generic_Name. Unexpectedly, one day she talked to her teacher about her problem with her parents, which didn't seem to go away. After telling her teacher what happened and what her friend told her to do, her teacher to told her that her problems are not going away, because she got the wrong advice from form her friend Generic_Name. Meanwhile, my mom acknowledged that she should have seek help form other people. Seeing the pro and cons of one persons advice is a good thing to do and I recommend you to do so.

Lastly, having multiple opinion on a single topic makes people confident.

Being confident on what your doing helps people have no regret. Confidence is gained when working hard. When people get advice form more than one person and work hard to solve their problems makes them confident. About 65% of confident is gained from seeking help from others. When a person is confident that person won't have regrets and won't dawt themselves.

A person seeking advice from one person and a person that has multiple opinions form different people are very different. Seeking advice form more than one person and having multiple opinion on one topic is very helpful, because, helps make the right choice, helps see the pro and cons of one persons advice, and make the person asking confident.

Paris bans driving due to smog""

talks about how after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It says that on Mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day, I think that this should happen all around the world, so the world can be a better palce to live in.

[Last] week Paris had a 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London"".

2B967783327C,"A life without Cars. A life without cars would be a completely different than what most Americans expeirence today. We use Cars for basically everything. Shopping, Recreation, and socialization are all based upon the automobile. As Americans, its the general idea that you go get your license and a car, and its a normal part of life. Not many Cities are based upon the ideals of not needing a vehicle. Places where people can walk to the place they want to eat, or efficent public transportation so they can arrive at the movies on time. Everything they need as components of their lives in in reach.

A smart town is compact, meaning everything you need for a town smushed together. With everything being compacted, resources can be better managed, meaning more resources can be used in a general thing, or just not used at all. Not needing to use enourmous amounts of resources is better for the enviroment, and the tax payer. Tax payer not having the burden of all those taxes, means a happier tax payer. All the money thats not used on on taxes can be used to spend at the local stores, leading to a strong economic outlook. All because we compacted our cities, and limited car use. That's an ideal city to me. Making a compact city might not be in America's future though. We like our wide open spaces, and our huge backyards. So maybe what we need to do is invest in a reliable and smooth public transportation complex. Something that can take the population around the area. Transportation that can get me from my place of residence; to a place where I can get a bite, or have a good time. A intertwined suburban existence. Where there are no engine pollution or loud car commotion.

Without all the engine pollution or noise pollution that comes out of these ideal suburbs; people will be less stressed. Meaning their lives will also be happier and healthier. Imagine it. All because we changed the way we do things, we can be happy, and eliminate pollution. I could see myself waking up in the morning in a nice little home, and getting ready. Then going down the street to where I can take a bus, or taxi wherever I wanted. I would do what I want, and not need a car for it. I can focus on what's really important.

Like how much pollution we were really letting off from our cars. Different settings had different levels of pollution, but it all leads up to be a ridiculous amount. If we limited our car use; we could make a big difference in the amount of greenhouse gases we throw up into our air. Meaning we'll have cleaner air. Can you smell that? Thats the smell of crisp clean air. There's nothing like taking a breath of air out in the wilderness. Where the trees absorbs the contaminated air; only leaving the crisp refreshing air behind. That could be everywhere if we limited car use!

A life where it's normal to not have a vehicle in Amerian Society sounds like it would be pretty nice. I would love being able to take a bus or even walk to something interesting. Maybe it's in our future. It may even be right now. Are you willing to try to give up your car? Are you willing to try to have a social revolution and change the way Americans live their lives?

falcon_180b_v1_250,"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is an article about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that can identify human emotions. The system can detect the smallest movements in the face to determine what emotion someone is feeling. While this is a fascinating technology, it raises the question of whether it's valuable to use it to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

On one hand, the Facial Action Coding System could be helpful for teachers to know if a student is struggling or not engaged in a lesson. For example, if a student is frowning or has a furrowed brow, the teacher might know to check in with them and offer help. This technology could also help teachers identify bullying or other negative behaviors in the classroom.

However, on the other hand, using this technology could invade a student's privacy. It may make students feel uncomfortable or like they're being watched all the time. Additionally, the technology may not always be accurate, and a student could be misjudged based on their facial expressions.

In conclusion, while the Facial Action Coding System is a fascinating technology, it may not be valuable to use in a classroom setting. While it could potentially help teachers identify struggling students, it could also make students uncomfortable and potentially misjudge them. It's important to consider the privacy and feelings of students before using technology like this in the classroom.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

I think she told me that because, people opinions could be good for you and its probably a good idea for you to listen. Or that person thoughts could be horrible and could cost you your future as a criminal and that would lead to you being behind bars. But a positive outcome is that multiple opinions is better than one because what people think is the best idea for you is probably a good idea for you to listen. But also their ideas could be bad and good at the same time so when you apply the advice to the situation and could have a positive and negative outcome.

I personally think when getting advice always go search for it in your most trustworthy friends and family so that they can give you a good opinion. When you ask them and you receive lots of the same response it probably a good idea to listen and take their knowledge in and use it. Most importantly if you receive other information not like the other information your family and friends gave you its good to try the advice. Only to see if they give good advice or just to see if it was a better idea.

Also not all advice is good advice. Receiving advice from people that you know will lead you down a bad life or a bad lifestyle could get you into a lot of trouble or you could get hurt. When seeking advice make sure they know what they're talking about and if it doesn't seem right most likely their opinion is bad.

a3405a91,"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. This idea is supported by various articles, including ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, and ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. These articles highlight the benefits of reducing car dependency, such as improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased physical activity.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. Cars are one of the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a significant cause of climate change. According to the article by Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and mitigate the harmful effects of climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. In the article by Duffer, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to combat intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and a reduction in particulate matter per cubic meter. Similarly, in Bogota, the car-free day initiative led to a significant decrease in traffic jams and a reduction in smog levels, as mentioned in Selsky's article. These examples demonstrate how limiting car usage can contribute to cleaner and healthier air for citizens.

Another advantage of reducing car dependency is the promotion of physical activity and healthier lifestyles. When individuals rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or using public transit. This increased physical activity can lead to numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, increased muscle tone, and weight management. As stated in Rosenthal's article, cities like Bogota have seen the construction of miles of bicycle paths, the creation of parks and sports centers, and the replacement of pitted sidewalks with smooth ones. These changes encourage an active lifestyle and contribute to the overall well-being of citizens.

In addition to environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to more efficient transportation systems. In the article by Rosenthal, it is mentioned that Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, has stores placed within walking distance on a main street, promoting a compact and accessible layout. This approach reduces the need for large parking lots and encourages the use of public transportation. By adopting similar strategies, communities can improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and make transportation more efficient overall.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. This approach can lead to improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased physical activity, and more efficient transportation systems. As highlighted in the articles, various initiatives and experiments worldwide have shown the positive impact of reducing car dependency. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation and promoting smart planning, individuals and communities can contribute to a healthier environment and enhanced quality of life.",1,radek_500,,3

According to the text,""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

Second, when we took a picture of the Face in 1976. It was because of the weather that it looked like a face. Another reason is because of the angle that we took a picture in. It might also have been the camera. Because of the angle that in took the picture in, the shadow of the mountains made it look like a face. According to the text,""The caotion noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth.""

Next, in 1998, we decided to take another picture of the Face. The tecnology became better and so we got a better view of the Face. It does't look as much like the face we took a picture of in 1976. This time it looked more like a crater. It wasn't a face after all.

8E4BBBA4018F,"Students think of school as a stressful and challenging obstacle. The amount of work put on them causes them to think that school is not a place for them. School is supposed to be a place where we can identify our future career path. Having these classes can help students think of school as a nurturing environment and not a terrifying world of homework. I definitely agree with the principals choice of making a mandatory extra-curriculum class, since it can have a lot of positive effects on the students. Having these extra classes will help the kids control their mental health and help them pursue their future career goals. It will also encourage them to try new activities.

Having extra-curriculum classes will help the students control their mental health. School can be very stressful and this is one way to overcome the stress. These classes will help them forget about the other class for a while and relax the body. For example, for students who enjoy to do art and work with their hands freely, pottery classes are excellent. Pottery class can help them forget about the stress they had in their other classes and let out the stress in a calming way. Next, students take tests as a terrifying piece of paper and that can make them worry for the whole day. The extra classes will help them forget about the test for a while and clear their mind. Science has shown that doing an activity that we enjoy can help us do better on the test, since we have a clear mindset. An example is I had my writing sol and circles quiz on the same day. I had two major things to worry about and that was really scary. Once I was done with my writing sol I still had band and math to go to. When I went to band, it helped me forget that I had a math quiz today and cleared my mind before. When I headed out to math and started taking the quiz I thought the quiz was really easy and I don't know why I was so terrified of this quiz. Finally, the extra classes lets the brain stop taking in information to just rearrange the ideas and to relax it. Having so much information in the brain can cause the student to forget important factors. If a student is playing a sport he or she enjoys like soccer, taking a class on soccer can not only let the student have fun, but also relax the brain and be free. The extra curriculum activities can help fix these three mental health weaknesses.

Secondly, these classes can help pursue their future career goals. Some students already know what they want to go into when they grow older and they want to take classes that will help them lead up to their dream career. Letting the kids have a mandatory extra-curriculum class can help the kids lead to reaching that goal. For example, if a student wants to major in culinary arts, doing a cooking class would be good. It can teach him or her new skills that will help him or her get better. Another reason why extra activities help pursue future goals is the classes will go deeper into the topic the student wants to pursue. If a student wants to go into Microbiology, they not only have to take life science, but they need to take a class about biology. This class can go even more deeper about microbiology. Taking these classes or activities can go further into the knowledge of the topic. Lastly, for students who don't know what career path they want to go through they have a chance to see what they might like. Having these classes opens up a wide variety of activities that students can do and they can see if they enjoy it or not. Depending if they like it or not they have a choice of going through that pathway in the future. As shown, having these different classes can help pursue or find future career pathways and goals.

The last reason why we should have these extra activities or classes is it helps us try new activities. Some students are very quiet and are a introvert. They don't really talk to people much and they keep their thoughts inside most of the time. For someone like them having these classes will help them open up more and try something new like being part of a student leadership council. Another way these activities help us try new activities is they will help the student see their likes and dislikes of a topic. For example, I never enjoyed sewing and during seventh grade we had to take FACS which was a class where you learn about family, cooking, and sewing. When we came to the sewing topic I wasn't very interested with the machines and the idea of sewing in general. Once we started our first project which was building an ear bud pouch I started to enjoy doing things with the sewing machine. I soon fell in love with sewing and one of my likes is sewing. This shows how trying somethings can be positive. The final reason that extra classes help us try new activities is it can open up many ideas or thoughts about the activity and opens up pathways to go through in the future. For example, if a student tried leadership council and enjoyed it, they might want to continue being a leader and become a lawyer in the future. In conclusion, this shows that having these extra classes can make students try something new and different.

I agree with the principals choice that each student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Having these classes will have a big impact on the students, such as controlling their mental health, pursuing their future career goals, and encouraging them to try different activities. Having the extra classes will help the students have a better view of how school is and why we come here. ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
6D3D5F619A29,"To keep students learning, schools are requiring students to complete summer projects. Students are very busy over the summer, so school work is not their first thought. Summer projects should be student-designed so the students can have fun while they're learning and not feel pressured to complete the projects.

When students have fun learning, they are able to learn more. This makes information easier to understand. Comprehension also becomes less difficult. Therefore, if learning is exciting, it won't feel like such a task. Students will be more willing to be educated and learn.

Also, pressuring students to complete projects can cause them to become overwhelmed. If projects are designed by the students, they won't feel forced to complete them. Students are more likely to do the assignment this way. Since students don't feel rushed to complete assignments, it won't feel like homework and students will be more willing to finish.

There's so many ways students can have fun while learning and not feel pressured to complete work, however, making projects student-designed is just one of them. Students are young adults wanting to be educated. Once students are able to fully understand the task at hand, completing it is not a problem.

C7A28C7A3786,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is important for people to push beyond their current abilities in order to grow and develop. This can be achieved through setting goals, taking on new challenges, and constantly learning and improving.

Firstly, setting goals is crucial for personal growth. By setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals, individuals can focus their efforts on areas that will help them improve. For example, if someone wants to improve their physical fitness, they could set a goal to run a certain distance in a certain amount of time. This will help them to stay motivated and work towards a specific objective.

Secondly, taking on new challenges is an important part of personal growth. By stepping outside of their comfort zone and trying something new, individuals can learn new skills and expand their horizons. For example, if someone has never tried public speaking before, they could take a public speaking class or join a debate team. This will help them to develop their communication skills and gain confidence in their abilities.

Lastly, constantly learning and improving is essential for personal growth. By staying curious and open to new ideas, individuals can continue to grow and develop throughout their lives. This can be achieved through reading books, taking classes, or seeking out new experiences. For example, if someone wants to improve their cooking skills, they could take a cooking class or experiment with new recipes. This will help them to develop their culinary abilities and learn new techniques.

In conclusion, I believe that people should push beyond their current abilities in order to grow and develop. By setting goals, taking on new challenges, and constantly learning and improving, individuals can continue to grow and become the best version of themselves. It may be uncomfortable at times, but the rewards of personal growth are well worth the effort.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,7
83C48C5697AE," Living in a place with frequent demands to provide my best is one of the most important achievements. I agree with Emerson's statement that individuality is key to achieving our goals.

Individuality allows us to trust in ourselves and our abilities to become the best. When we work alone, we are more likely to put in the effort and dedication required to achieve success. Working by ourselves also provides us with the opportunity to explore different options and find the best solution to our problems.

Competition can be a good way to motivate us to work harder and become better. However, it can also lead to a decrease in teamwork. Individual competition, where we are pitted against each other, can be especially motivating. For example, when a person starts working in a new job and receives more money because they are doing a great job, it can motivate others to work harder as well.

However, competition can also lead to jealousy and resentment, especially when others feel that they are being unfairly rewarded. In such cases, it is important to remember that our accomplishments are based on our own efforts and abilities, and not on the efforts of others.

In conclusion, living in a place with frequent demands to provide our best and working by ourselves can help us to achieve our goals and become the best version of ourselves. Competition can be a good motivator, but it is important to remember that our accomplishments are based on our own efforts and abilities.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

F1270F8362F8,"Math is an essential part of our daily lives, and it has been an important part of mine too. I have always found math to be a fascinating subject, and I believe it has played a significant role in shaping my life.

One of the most obvious ways math is used in daily life is in financial transactions. For example, when I buy groceries at the store, I need to calculate the total cost of my items, including taxes and any discounts I might be eligible for. Math is also used in budgeting and saving money, which are essential skills for financial stability.

Another place where math is used in daily life is in technology. Math is the foundation of many technological devices, including computers, smartphones, and cars. Without math, these devices would not be able to perform the complex calculations required to function properly. For example, when I use my GPS to navigate to a new location, the device uses math to calculate the shortest route based on current traffic conditions.

Math is also used in science and engineering. For example, when scientists design new drugs or medical devices, they use math to calculate the properties of the substance and ensure it is safe for use. Engineers use math to design bridges, buildings, and other structures, ensuring they are safe and efficient.

In terms of preparing for success in the future, math is a crucial subject. Many careers require a strong foundation in math, including engineering, science, and finance. Additionally, math skills are transferable to many other subjects, such as physics, computer science, and even art.

However, math is not always perceived positively by others. Some people view math as a difficult and tedious subject, while others see it as a necessary evil. However, I believe that math is an essential skill that everyone should have, regardless of their interests or career goals.

In conclusion, math is an essential part of our daily lives, and it has been an important part of mine too. Math is used in financial transactions, technology, science, and engineering, and it is essential for success in many careers.

In our day and time phones have become the main problem in this world. Phones have made it so easy for people to get in trouble and into wrecks. Why are phones so important that we can't even put it down while there driving? So, what can we try to do to prevent people getting distracted by their phones while driving?

Why are phones so important that we can't even put them down while driving? Well for one it is because social media, social media has impacted this world to where people think that they must be on it 24/7. This is getting to the point to where people are having to many wrecks and losing lives over their phones. Phones while driving is just another way to say an accident waiting to happen. So, let's try to not let our phones be a distraction while driving, its not worth the consequences.

What can we try to do to prevent people getting distracted by their phones while driving? The best way possible is to put your phone on silent mode, that way it will post pone all notifications until it is turned off. The second good way is to put it out of reach (glove box, trunk, etc.) that way you will have no tendency to grab it and look at for a distraction. We need to make the roads safe as possible. If you have something that is going to distract you then you are putting yourself in danger and most importantly other drivers around you. Lets just put them away while driving it will not kill you to leave it alone until you have reached your destination.

I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving. I have given you a lot of ways to why I think it shouldn't. Most states have already made the law to where if they see you with it in your hands they are going to give you a ticket. I just don't understand why people would want to put their life and others in danger just because they are phones addicts. So, try not to be to inconsiderate people. That is what I think about driving with phones, I would love to hear your side of the story.

For example, people will not have to take a bus to visit other people, or walk miles to see other folks, instead they can just call in their phones and have a little chit chat by using tecnology.

Second, is that the tecnology can do part of the work, for example you are writing a note for a paty, ceremony, marry, whatever, and it have to be one for each person, what are you woing to do? just by using the technnology you can print evrithing you want, it makes easy your work, also have more time to do something else.

Third, some benefits of the technology is the time that you spent looking for sonthing or deciding, another benfit is the things that you can learn with all the information that is in the web, ofcourse if you use it properly like it is.

Asking more than one person for opinions will have a lot of different thoughts, and opinions will also help because it will tell you what other people think of what ever situation you are in.

This list will be baised on reasons and facts that i think will be sutible for my reason you may have your own facts and opinions but remember anyone can say what they think so this is what i think. Now let us begin.

First off i want to start with on how it will allow votes to have a certainty of outcome. In the source 3: in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president by:  Richard A. Ponser he talks about that a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Also he talks about winner-take-all basis, and that even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in the state. From what i understand is that electoral college helps create a winner-take-all basis.

Second i would love to disscuse how it requires a trans-regional appeal. In source 3 he talks about how the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (south, northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful    ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

E730AA199FB6,"Imagine that your summer has begun and school is finally out. As months pass, you aren't concerned with work. Although, that is, until you remember your summer project for school! If only the project was student based, where there is more freedom in thinking and idea making. That said, Summer projects designed by students would be most beneficial because students can show what they know, develop independent and creative ideas, and can apply their strengths and weaknesses according to how they learn the best.

Teachers and parents alike may agree that it is more beneficial to have teacher designed projects, since they have more structured experience as well as having mastered the material. While this is a valid argument, with teacher designed projects, not all student's learning needs can be catered to. This is because every child has different strengths and weaknesses with different thought processes, especially having been away from school material for that period of time. Also, although teachers may have better structure and organization with their ideas having more experience, students need to develop those independent thinking and idea making skills for their higher education and overall knowledge. This said, teacher's should not be the ones to design summer projects.

To begin, students can show what material they already know and or have mastered by designing their own summer projects. Although projects can be designed to challenge students, having students show what they know and have mastered can help the teacher understand where they stand on certain issues and in different subjects.

Take a professional athlete for example, such as Olympic gymnast, Gabby Douglass. In her years of practice, Gabby has been asked to make up her own floor routines to show off what skills she has already mastered. When competing, this gives Gabby a chance to both show her instructors and judges what she knows, and therefore, what new skills she can work on later, after she has mastered those demonstrated skills. This can therefore be applied to a summer project in the way that after practicing a skill for however long, a student can show off their mastery for that skill, as well as setting aside the skills they will need to work on in the future when designing their own projects.

Secondly, with student designed projects, students can be independent and creative in their thinking and ideas.

This independence is valued by students, as it gives them a chance to think for themselves and come up with new and valid ideas that they may not have been given otherwise. For example, when women were granted the right to vote almost one hundred years ago, their thinking and ideas did not fit with the structure already in place in society for hundreds of years. For those hundreds of years, women were not given the chances and opportunities to be independent until they worked to prove their ideas to be valid. Although this does not directly relate to school, it provides a great example as to an individual student being able to use their independent thinking to create great ideas that can benefit them now and in the far future.

Finally, students know their strengths and weaknesses and can apply these when designing summer projects, depending on how they learn the best. Once summer has begun, students are away from their normal learning environments, which may make it challenging to succeed in some areas of their learning. This is also because every child has a different or varying learning style. For example, I am a very visual and hands on learner. I prefer writing on paper and being artistic in the way I present my work, and learn best that way. If the project designed by a teacher is using computers to do math online, I'd be at a disadvantage compared to another student who may excel in math and using technology together. This makes it harder for each student to be learning and succeeding at the same rate. Therefore, projects designed by students can be self paced, catering to each individual's learning strengths, weaknesses and differences.

During summer, students should be able to be independent in their own ideas and thinking regarding school material. Schools and administration should grant students that independence in their individual learning and let them take the initiative of showing what they know, how they can form ideas and prove their overall independence in designing their own summer projects as they grow in their school careers.",0,persuade_corpus,,8

llama_70b_v149,"I think that schools should not allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. First of all, it's not fair to the students. We deserve some privacy, and being able to see our grades and attendance online would be like having our parents breathing down our necks all the time. It would be really stressful and would make us feel like we're being watched all the time.

Another reason why this is a bad idea is that it would make it harder for students to make mistakes and learn from them. If our parents can see everything we do, they might try to fix our mistakes for us instead of letting us figure it out ourselves. This would make us dependent on them and wouldn't teach us how to be responsible for ourselves.

Also, this would take away the trust between students and teachers. If parents can see everything, they might start to question the teachers and their methods, which would create a lot of tension and conflict. This would make it harder for the teachers to do their job and would create a bad learning environment for the students.

Furthermore, some students might not have access to the internet or a computer at home, which would make it unfair for them. They would be at a disadvantage compared to other students who do have access to these things.

In conclusion, allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online is not a good idea.

A47EBEEF081E,"Summer projects can help students continue learning during summer break. However, there is a debate on whether they should be designed by the teachers or the students. I think they should be designed by the teachers for several reasons: teachers' experience will help them create more engaging projects, teachers will know what their students struggled on throughout the year and will be able to address those topics in the project, and teachers will assure that the project is on the student's grade level.

First of all, teachers have way more experience creating assignments than students do. This superior knowledge will help them create a project that will go deeper than the surface level, which students might not be able to do if designing their own project. This more in-depth project will be more engaging in the students and should help them learn better over the summer break.

Second, the teachers have been with the students for at least a year. Throughout the year the teachers have been seeing what topics students are doing well in or what topics they need more help with. If a student is struggling in a area, then the summer project should be about that topic to ensure that the students jumps back into learning prepared. If a student were to design the project them self, they would want to make it about easy topics or topics they are already good at, not the ones they really need help in. Having teachers create the projects will ensure that the most needed topics are covered and will help students get back to learning with less confusion.

Finally, If a teacher designs the summer project it will definitely be on the student's grade level. While a student might be able to create a project that they would enjoy doing or is engaging to them, they will most likely make it easy for them self which will hinder their learning. A summer project should challenge the student's knowledge on their grade level, and only a teacher can ensure that that happens. A on grade level project will properly challenge the students without being to easy or to hard which studies have shown to be more effective for the students learning.

Overall, summer project should be constructed by teachers and not students because the teachers can make the projects engaging, specialized, and on grade level. Students will learn better over break, come back to the classroom with less confusion, and will learn more effectively. While it might be fun for the student to design their own project, students should be given the best possible opportunity for learning and only a teacher can guarantee that. That is why teachers should design summer assignments rather that students.     ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
falcon_180b_v1_539,"Arts education plays a crucial role in providing a well-rounded education. It allows students to express and explore their creativity, while also promoting critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Therefore, I believe that arts education should not be optional but rather an essential part of the school curriculum.

First and foremost, arts education provides a platform for students to express their emotions, thoughts, and ideas creatively. It allows them to develop their unique voice and perspective, which can be beneficial in various aspects of life beyond just art. For instance, a study conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts found that students who participate in the arts are more likely to engage in community service and volunteer work. This demonstrates how arts education instills values such as empathy, compassion, and social responsibility.

Moreover, arts education encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Creating art requires students to make decisions, solve problems, and think outside the box. These skills are not only relevant in the arts but also transferable to other subjects like Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). In fact, a report by the STEM to STEAM initiative revealed that integrating arts into STEM education leads to increased innovation, creativity, and engagement among students.

Lastly, arts education promotes cultural understanding and diversity. Through exposure to different forms of art, students learn about various cultures, traditions, and perspectives. This fosters respect, tolerance, and appreciation for diversity, which is essential in our increasingly globalized world. Additionally, it provides an opportunity for students to explore their own cultural heritage and share it with others, contributing to a more inclusive and harmonious school community.

In conclusion, arts education should be an integral part of the school curriculum because it fosters creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving, cultural understanding, and diversity. These benefits extend beyond the arts and contribute to the overall development of well-rounded individuals who are equipped to succeed in various aspects of life.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Many people believe that arts education is essential for a well-rounded education, while others think that it should be optional.

For our essay, I researched the benefits of having a summer break for students. I think it's super important to have a break from school after the long year we have. Here are some pros and cons of having a summer break, and I'll support my argument with evidence.

Pro: Relaxation and recharge
Summer break gives us a chance to relax and recharge after a long year of learning. It's like, our brains are tired from all the studying and taking tests, and we need a break to chill out. Studies show that students who get enough sleep and relaxation during the summer break perform better in school than those who don't. (Source: National Sleep Foundation)

Pro: Exploration and fun
Summer is the perfect time to explore new things and have fun! We can go on trips, hang out with friends, and do stuff we wouldn't normally do during the school year. It's like, we get to experience life outside of school and learn new things.

Pro: Learning and skill-building
Summer break isn't just about relaxation and fun, it's also a time for learning and skill-building. We can take online courses, attend camps, or participate in other activities that help us develop new skills. For example, I'm taking a coding course online this summer to learn how to code. Research shows that students who participate in summer learning programs have better academic performance and higher graduation rates. (Source: Harvard Graduate School of Education)

Con: Loss of learning
One con of summer break is that we might lose some of the learning we did during the school year. If we don't keep learning and practicing what we learned, it can be hard to remember everything. Research shows that students can lose up to a month of learning over the summer if they don't engage in activities that challenge their minds. (Source: University of California, Irvine)

Con: Social isolation

F01C08F2B1C8,"Many people feel that the president plays a very imperative role in the United States. He has much responsibility and an enormous influence on what this country stands for. So, surely, this president must be carefully sought out from the abundance of other candidates. It is quite contreversial as to what method is best for selecting them. Although an electoral college may appear as the right path, the countries interest unvariably lies with the popular vote because it is fair and unstressful unlike the electoral college.

Firstly, the electoral college is quite unfair. It is mentioned by Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" that some of the states do not even get to see candidates under the electoral college system. Candidates don't even bother with the states that they don't have a chance of winning over. They focus all of their attention on swings states. This means that some states have to vote based on just what they have heard. These people could have heard rumors and now are voting under false impressions. They deserve their own fair share of information from the candidates themselves. Also, under the electoral college the people of this nation aren't even voting for their president. They are voting for the electors. All that they can do is hope that the person that they voted for votes in their favor (Plumer). There is no guarentee that they will, so people have little say in who is president. This is their country, they should be able to decide who does and doesn't govern it. It is mentioned that with the popular vote larger states get more attention than little ones (Posner). The popular vote may not be entirely fair to all states, but it most definitely is better than the electoral college. Even Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO agree that the electoral college should be abolished.

As if this wasn't enough to get rid of the electoral system, the popular vote is also much less stressful. First off, the there could be a tie. If there is a tie, the decision goes to the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is likely that the result of their voting will not be at the will of the people (Plumer). Isn't it just easier to have their load lightened and take the stress of thep possibility off thier back? Although the outcome of a tie is unlikely (Posner) it is still possible and causing unnecessary stress. Additionally, the electoral college results in the presence of the disaster factor (Plumer). If a repeat of the 2000 fiasco (the biggest election crisis in the past hundred years (Plumer)) is what America is looking for then by all means choose to stick with the electoral college.

In summation, it is prominent that the most potent option for this naiton is to elect the president of the United States by popular vote. Even though the electoral college does have some pros, the ultimate candidate is the popular vote as it ensures fairness and a virtually stressless voting process. Who doesn't want that?

But a town in Germany named Vauban has given up their cars. Vauban's streets are ""car-free"" - except the main thorughfare, where the tram to downtown Freibug runs, and a few streets on the edge of the community. America has been making some changes to the modern day car suck as hybrid and energy efficent. ""All of the development since WWII has been centered on the car, and that will havet o change"" said David Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg also added "" How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.

Paris has had some pollution problems, because of this tey enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. People that owned cars would be on a rotation. Even number license plates would drive on day and not the next, same when for the odd number plates. It took almost 5 days to life the smog. A good reason why are not so good to the envoirment no matter how we change them. Did you know Beijing, China is one of the most polluted cities in the world.

Heres a great story writen by Andrew Selsky. Bogota, Columbia- In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hikes, biked, skates, or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. That was the third striaght year that Columbia had a car-free day. So many citys are starting to have a car-free day just to cut back on pollution, i think that is amazing, i wonder of we can get Florida to do somwthing like this one day.

The End of Car Culture. Studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses each year. Transportation is the second largest source of American's emissions, just behind the power plant. New York has a new bike sharing program that has skyrocketed in the last few months.

There are just little things we can do to helo the enviorment, like not driving a car for a day or buy a new hybrid to cut down pollution, Or maybe you have an idea small things can change our world for the better. We can start small then work from there, it doesnt have to be big to affect out planet.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

The machine reads your face and uses muscles to sense what you are feeling. I am against the Facial Action System And I will tell you why.

In the article it says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Kids might not be comfortale in a classrrom that has a machine that can identify their emotuons. That is very nerve-racking and would make it hard to focus and learn.

falcon_180b_v1_680,"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows them to gather different perspectives and insights from various individuals. When people seek advice, they often have a preconceived notion of what they want to do or what they think is best. However, by talking to multiple people, they can gain a more well-rounded understanding of the situation and consider factors they may not have thought of before.

For example, if someone is trying to decide which university to attend, they may have a clear idea of which school they prefer. However, by speaking with multiple people, such as current students, alumni, and admissions officers, they can get a better sense of the academic programs, campus culture, and financial aid options offered by different universities. This can help them make a more informed decision and choose the school that best fits their needs and goals.

In addition, seeking multiple opinions can also help someone identify potential blind spots or biases in their thinking. When we are too close to a situation, it can be difficult to see things objectively. However, by speaking with others who have different backgrounds and experiences, we can gain new insights and perspectives that we may not have considered otherwise.

Overall, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by providing them with a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and allowing them to consider different factors and perspectives before making a decision.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

C75471F5ED96,"Summer projects allow students to have the opportunity to learn while they are not in school and it can benefit them in many ways. Summer projects should be designed by students because it gives students the opportunity to learn more about something of their choice, it shows that they have a connection with the project, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things.

Students should be given the opportunity to create a project about something of their choice. It gives them independence and the ability to rely on themselves. It is good to give students independence starting at a young age because it allows them to be self reliant. Giving students the opportunity to create a project based on their own ideas and their own planning, will allow for success later in life.

Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it will show the teacher how much of a connection they have to the topic. Teachers love when a student creates a well designed and well thought out project. If a student were to be given a project designed by the teacher, the student would feel like they couldn't do much with it because they have no connection with it. When students have a connection with something it makes them feel more enthusiastic about the project or assignment given to them.

Students are more eager to learn about new things after they researched something of their choice. When students have a choice, they would rather research something that they don't know too much about. After that topic is researched they feel enlightened. Students also tend to branch off of the topic that they first researched as well. This technique is often used by students because it makes research easier for them and they like to make things easier for them rather than harder.

In conclusion, Students should be able to design their own summer projects because it gives them new opportunities, it shows that they can connect to something, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things. Although teachers can provide students with a base and a template for their project, it would be best and beneficial for students to be able to create and think of something on their own. Students are more prepared for college and high up positions in life when they are given the opportunity to create something of their own. It allows students to have independence and other useful tools for their future.              ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

I believe that implementing a policy that requires students to have a minimum grade B average in order to participate in sports or other extracurricular activities is a positive change. I think that students are more likely to put in their best effort when they know that their hard work will be recognized and rewarded. By setting a high standard, we can motivate students to strive for excellence in all areas of their lives.

However, I understand that not every student may be equally skilled in every subject. If a student puts in their best effort and still does not achieve a grade B average, it may not be fair to exclude them from participating in extracurricular activities. In this case, I suggest that an alternative approach be taken, such as offering additional support or resources to help the student improve their grades.

While changing school policy can be a difficult decision, I believe that it is ultimately necessary in order to promote academic excellence and personal growth. By setting high standards and providing the necessary support, we can help our students reach their full potential and achieve success in all areas of their lives.

One of the main advantages of graduating early is that it allows students to gain valuable experience in their chosen field. By entering college or the workforce a year earlier, they can gain practical knowledge and skills that will be useful in their future careers.

Some students perform community service. Some tutor elementary students and others clean up litter. They take this task seriously. However, many other students who do not wish to partake have the perspective that community service is time consuming, and unnecessary to complete. For this reason, I do not believe that community service should be mandatory and required. For example, many students feel that this duty will take away their privilege to get what they need and what they want to do. For the unwilling students, I think making community service mandatory will also effect their work performance in school, since all their time would be invested into this service and not into their studies. However, for the willing individuals who insist in participating community service, they have their own choice and judgement to join or not, therefore the decision was none other than their own.

The answer is all of them it is much better to ask multiple peoples opinions than just one for multiple reasons. Keep reading because I'm going to explain them to you so that you can a better under standing of it.

The first reason is that you are you and not every one thinks the same way. By asking more people you will have a solution that works best for you. Remember that you don't have to take any one persons advise you can use the the advise given to you to form your own solution. Over all you get a more personalized response to your problems or question.

Another reason is that not every one has the experience and knowledge on your situation. Not everyone knows how to do it or what to do. If you ask your dad and he knows nothing about it you cant just give up. you have to ask multiple people someone will give an answer. However you cant stop there you need something that works for you and some body who might have more experience in that area of life and give something that works better for you.

Last but not least if you have a question and you ask more than person you are going to get a more valid response.

What do I mean I mean if the majority of people give one response it probably the correct answer. You dont to ask one person only to find out that they're wrong. I would also advise you to ask the person why they think what they think. asking more than one person will help you better stand the problem and by doing that we can narrow it down to give the most valid response.

Thats why its better to ask multiple people. You will have a valid and personalized response from people of all different backgrounds. So next time you need help finding a solution use this advise.

7740DF009E10,"Okay! Here is an essay I came up with:

Staying active is super important for achieving our goals. It's not just about getting exercise, it's about gaining knowledge and experiences too! When we stay active, we learn new things and develop new skills, which helps us grow as people. It also helps us build our self-esteem and confidence, which makes us feel more comfortable in our own skin. Plus, when we stay active, we're more likely to keep going after we face obstacles, which is important for achieving our dreams.

For example, if you want to be a scientist when you grow up, you should try to do experiments and projects on your own. You could even start a science fair project and show it to your class! By staying active, you'll learn new things about science and develop skills that will help you in the future. And, when you face challenges, you'll be more likely to keep going and reach your goal.

It's not just about school either. When we stay active, we're also building our self-esteem and confidence. For instance, if you like to play sports, you'll learn how to work as a team and communicate with your teammates. You'll also learn how to handle losing and how to be a good sport. These are important skills that will help you in life!

Also, when we stay active, we're preparing for the future. Whether it's getting a job or starting a family, staying active will help us be more successful. For example, if you want to be a doctor when you grow up, you should start reading about different illnesses and practicing how to examine patients. By staying active, you'll be more prepared for your future career.

Finally, daily activities have a big impact on our lives. For instance, if you like to draw, you should keep practicing. You never know when you might become a famous artist! And, if you like to read, you should keep reading. You might discover a new favorite book or author. By staying active, you'll be able to enjoy your hobbies and interests more.

Nasa has taken photos of the land form whe never they have been able to get a good shot of it, which is not very often.

Skeptics were far from convinced by the 1998 photos, many of them claimed that NASA had chosen to take the picture during a cloudy period of Mars' year to cover up an ancient alien artifact, or possible markings. Skeptics did not realise that NASA would benifit monumentaly from the discovery of an ancient alien monument on the surface of mars. In 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor again was close enough to catch a pitcure of the Face on Mars, the picture spanned a total of 1.56 meters compared to the Viking's 43 meters per pixel photo, The Surveyors photo revealed simply a landform similar to that of a mesa of butte.

AB5EBB04C48D,"If someone were to ask multiple people for advice, they are most likely trying to get different peoples perspectives or different opinions to either decide which one is more logical or makes more sense in the situation. Because for example, if someone needed help with a friend, one person might know the friend and had a past with the friend and their response could be more bias compared to someone who doesn't know your friend.

Say someone asked me for advice. I would first, figure out the issue, second think about it for a while, while thinking what would be best for the person to do, and third, give a non-bias response. When people give bias responses, it's typically not the best advice. Because usually, when the response is bias, it's based off something that happened with the person who you're talking to and it could conflict with your situation.

What I typically do is when I hear multiple peoples advice is, I usually collaborate them. If I hear two peoples advice I always think about them both, if they both seem like a good idea and I try my best to collaborate them together while still adding in my own opinion because I don't just want to use other peoples thinking, I want to use my own in these cases.

Sometimes people could ask the wrong people for advice and it could influence you make make a not-so-smart choice. It's always a good idea to be open minded but you just have make sure to always be aware that sometimes people don't really know what they are talking about. That's why it's good to get a second source to help you balance or decided what final move your going to make.

Last, I think it's a good idea overall to ask for help. It shows that you are strong and confident enough to ask and it shows you want to take action in your life. asking multiple people is a great way to get a good answer and be confident with it. ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
7309980B7A6F,"Dear Principle

I do not agree that it is fair that students are not allow to participate in any sports or school activities unless the student have a B average. One reason is because lots of students love sports. Some people want to go to college to play sports and be able to go to the pros. If you don't give us the chance to learn and play and have fun in high school , then some of us are not going to play any sports.

Another reason why you shouldn't take our fun away because of our C average is because students love to join clubs and go on field trips and help out offices and ad for other teachers and lots of other stuff.

Now if you take all that away just because of our C average than this school will be so boring and students will start switching schools and the school will be known as the worst school in the U.S all because our principal decided to take our sports and activities away.

My final reason on why you shouldn't take our sports away or our activities is because a C average is not failing . A C average is passing . Now I see if students that really wanted to join in activities and play sports had a D or an F average then ill be like ""yeah, we don't need our sports or our activities because our grade is low and we re not passing , so we need to focus on our grade"" but students have a C average and a C average is passing and I believe students will work hard to get that C average up and still have a chance to play sports or/and join activities.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
F17DDEB77A2A," The summer vacation is often viewed as a time for students to relax and recharge after a long school year, but some educators believe that the summer break is not the best time for students to have a break. While it is true that some students may not retain information as easily when they return to school in the fall, overall, the summer is a great season to have a school break because of the many opportunities it presents.

One of the biggest advantages of the summer is the great weather. The warm and sunny days provide a perfect opportunity for students to engage in a variety of activities, both indoors and outdoors. From amusement parks and beaches to sports and outdoor adventures, the summer offers something for everyone. Additionally, the summer is a time when families can come together and spend quality time together, which can be especially beneficial for students who may have been feeling stressed or overwhelmed during the school year.

Another advantage of the summer is the opportunity for students to gain work experience. Many companies offer summer internships and part-time jobs for students, which can be a great way for them to gain valuable skills and experience. This can be especially beneficial for students who are looking to pursue a career in a particular field. By gaining work experience during the summer, students can gain a better understanding of what they want to do in the future and can make more informed decisions about their education and career goals.

Despite the many advantages of the summer, some may argue that summer vacations are too long and that year-round schools would be a better option. While this may be true, it is important to consider the impact of a constant school schedule on students. If students are constantly over-pressured and studying all the time without any breaks, they may become burnt out and may not be as effective learners.

In conclusion, while the summer vacation may not be the best time for everyone, it is still a great season to have a school break. The great weather, opportunities for work experience, and time for family and relaxation all make the summer a valuable time for students to recharge and prepare for the next school year.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

Throughout his life, Michelangelo faced numerous challenges and setbacks, but he never gave up on his dreams. In fact, he believed that setting your aim too high was a greater danger than setting it too low.

Michelangelo's quote, ""The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark,"" reflects his belief that it is better to aim high and miss than to aim low and succeed. He believed that if you set your sights too low, you would never truly achieve your full potential. On the other hand, if you set your sights too high, you may not always succeed, but you will at least be striving for greatness.

Michelangelo's own life is a testament to the dangers of setting your aim too low. Throughout his career, he faced numerous challenges and setbacks, but he never gave up on his dreams. He believed that if he set his sights too high, he would always be pushing himself to achieve greatness. This mindset allowed him to create some of the most iconic works of art in history, including the Sistine Chapel ceiling and the statue of David.

In contrast, those who set their aim too low are often content with mediocrity. They may never truly achieve their full potential, and they may never experience the joy and fulfillment that comes with striving for greatness. In short, setting your aim too low is a greater danger than setting it too high.

The ""Driverless Car"" will reduce car crashes, gas, money on transit, and will be able to mobilize the unmobilized. People's lives around the world would change for the better; and that's why this car should be used.

There are hundreds of car crashes everyday around the world due to careless drivers. Using the ""Driverless Car"", crashes could be be significantly reduced if not gone. This car could also take a normal tank of gas and cut it in half. With these two benefactors, pollution would be drastically reduced due to less fumes in the air due to gas and leakage when a crash happens. These would all be important factors people have to think about when buying a car and they should want the one that has the power to help the Earth. In the reading the narrator tells the readers that ""He believes such cars would fundementally change the world.""

Using this car means that the average person can now save money on transit. Then people wouldnt have to spend as much money filling up the tank of their cars or spend half of their paycheck for a car payment just to get from point a to point b. The narrator exclaims to the readers that, ""He envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system."" If these cars start being used, buses would soon disapear; making the air safer to breath due to the Diesel gas and the pollution buses set off.

Lots of people who are not able to drive take the bus, this may be because in their town there are not taxis. There are people who are unmobilized due to not own a vehicle because they're too expensive; or that they could have a medical condition where they cannot drive. These people now will not have to worry about making it to the bus stop on time or making sure the bus is going where they need to be. People could then save time of being on a bus for an hour, to go somewhere 10 minutes away; and be able to be picked up at their doorstep and dropped off at their destination. The narrator tells the readers that, ""The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.""

These cars would make the lives of everyone a lot more simple and efficient. Imagine a world with no traffic because there are no accidents; a world without pollution due to less gas use and buses, and a world where everyone has more money to spend on their families and on themselves. Unmobilized people could then feel more independant because they could then get themselves around. The world would be much better off using the ""Driverless Car"", it would be a perfect way to keep the Earth revolving.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
B3F0F2F6487F,"should the school extend the school day two hours and four-day a week?

people have different opinion about being ten hours in the school day. some people think it is a good idea for their kids to be ten hours at the school day. However, I believe that being ten hours in the school day it is not a good idea, because it dose not help for the energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid.

First, being ten hours in the school day dose not help in the energy and the resources; Because we spend the same amount of time at the school, But instead of spending an eight hours a day in five-day a week we will spend ten hours a day in four-day a week. so we are going to spend the same amount of energy in both.

Second, everyone's brain needs to a break. If we spent ten hours of our day at the school we are not going to be having that much time to live our lives, do our work and see our family. everyone needs to relax and sleep enough during the day to focus more and do more good at school.

Finally, ten hours is too much for a kid to spend in a day at the school. kids will dislike going to school. they will get tired. for example when my sister stay a little longer after school for extra work, she comes back home so tired, not talking to anyone and doing noting, because she is tired of being a little bit longer at the school.

In conclusion, as you have read. extend the school day two hours a day in four-day a week is not a good idea because it dose not help to conserve energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid. so what we can do is not extend the school day two hours a day, so all the kids can do good at the school, focus more and live their life happy.",0,original_moth,Task: Write an essay discussing the pros and cons of extending the school day two hours and four days a week.

4F2CC610F271,"School is a sacred place for learning, making new friends and becoming more confident in yourself. Many students however, may not have the ability to be open and confident with situations in school. Having more availability to online classes can be a benefit for those students who struggle in one or more specific areas. As an anticipated result of online classes, students will find a way to be more comfortable in their academic studies. These classes will benefit all reserved, exhausted and visual learning students.

First of all, some students are very reserved and as a result they tend to be shy as well. Unfortunately, many other students have been bullied and stay to their selves. These events can lead to a student not being comfortable in their own skin, nor school. With a situation like this, online school would be a great option for these students. Not only can they gain comfort but they can be at peace with their academics and mentality.

In addition to, school starts early there's no doubt about that. With the early starting time, many students have a hard time getting their day started, driving their cars to school and may not have the time to stop and eat breakfast. This can cause students to become groggy and have a hard time focusing in school. With the virtual classes being available, students can work on their studies on their own time. Willingly, this will increase attention spans and students will be more studious.

Nevertheless, with the new era us students are more prone to learn easier on technology. I've had personal experience where taking an online English class was more comfortable than being in a classroom. Students are more likely to be visual learners. Having a computer to their face and being able to have their own visual of the work they are doing may become more helpful in the long run.

In argument, a good majority of students may not have internet access or even a computer. Libraries are convenient but not everyone might have time or access to a near by library. My community is lucky and grateful to have something open to everyone. Unfortunately, not many can say the same. In addition, students may face losing personal experiences as to school dances, meeting new people and having a face to face friendship.

In conclusion, online school can be a great benefit to students who need it or may just feel more comfortable with the virtual classes. With the online classes students can become more studious, comfortable and even increase in their academic studies. These virtual classes will be in style to the rising generations and become a great opportunity to students who want to prepare for the working world.                 ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
6DA0FDDBAFB1,"Unreal Theories & Magazine Believings

I believe the face on mars is a natural landform. I believe this because, in a few paragraphs, they say that it can't be possible and that they took a picture and that wasn't the case. My three examples from the text are in paragraph 11, paragraph 7, and paragraph 9. The face on mars is a landform, and i could prove it to you.

In paragraph 11 it shows that this so called ""face"" is actually not a real face. It says in paragraph 11, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see wat they were"". I think that this ""fact"" is actually kind of unreal. For example, if you take a picture of the sun, and you make the picture 3 times bigger than that size, you wont see how the real sun looks because the picture doesnt have all the good pixels you need to get a perfect picture. Its almost to never when someone has a perfect picture and you can see every detail of the picture.

In paragraph 7 it states ""Thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared in a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"". Thats one of the best examples i have so far because, if they went up to mars to check out if this face was real or fake and it ended up to be fake, AND they have proof, of course its not going to be real. some people still believe that the face is still real as it says in paragraph 8. Some people were so anxious to have the answer, that they started to have theories about the planet. as it says in paragraph 8,""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze"". If anyone has heard me, i have said SKEPTICS. They said that for a reason to let people know that answers is better than a hypoothesis.

My last example is from paragraph 9. In paragraph 9, it says that "" Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. ""We just don't pass over the Face very often,"" he noted"".

They dont pass over the face very often because if you think about it, they just look straight down and scan the planet. The planet doesn't swirl on different sides. it stays in something that is called orbit. Orbit is something used for the plant to go in circles. it doesn't go everywhere like a regular sphere on earth, it has to stay in one place.

I believe that the Face isnt a real face, but actually a landform. I have chosen Those few examples to change your mind about how you feel about the Face, when, in all reality, its a landform. I believe I can change your mind about the feeling of knowing that this Face is a natural landform, most likely made by a meteor hitting the planet.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
72DF5D84477A,"Many students prefer to attend online classes to improve their knowledge. Why they choose online classes instead go to school everyday? There are many benefit and reasons they prefer online classes. Firstly distraction in classroom, students use to distract with others friends in class while the teacher is talking. Secondly the transportation is very important because a lot of students live far away from school. Finally taking online classes students get the same credit as taking the class inside the school.

In many schools, students have the option to choose online classes or classes in school. Firstly the benefit of taking online classes is students are able to do their work without distraction of their friends. For example, when the teacher is explaning the concept in the classroom some students like to talk and disctract others in classroom. However in online classes is only the teacher and there are not students distracting others in the class. Secondly students can ask any question about the concept of the class to the teacher. For example in class there is always something that students don't understand really well.

During the last decade students have been distractived with many king of technology like cellphones and video games on computer. But some schools also are taking advantage of this technology by offering online classes and creating opportinies to learn from home. Students can watch videos about explanation of classes on their phones. Basically this opportunity is helping many students give them knowledge and preparing them to the future.

The most important thing about online classes is that students get their credit as they were taking the regular class. Last year I had two option to choose, the first option was go to an academy to learn about marketing. The second option was take the online course from the academy. So this opportunity is great for everyone because students can improve their knowledge with online course and we still get the regular credit as we take the class in the academy.

Another benefit is in video conferencing the students can go back anytime they need in the video. In the other hand the students do not worry about transportation. Since many students arrive late to school they are not there when the teacher is giving the explanation to the class. Because the bus arrive late to school. In rural areas the schools are far away from the studen's home. So taking online classes they don't worry about it. Because all they need to do is log in their computer and to the class.

In conclusion, online classes is a great option to students. Studesnts get the same credit as taking the class in the school. Also there is not transportation to worry or the trafic to arrive late to school. Lastly there is not distraction in online class. Also the online class count as the regular class of the school. Finally there were some benefit that students get when they enroll in online classes. ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

3CFA497859E6,"Dear principal,

I don't think it's fair that you can't participate in a sport unless you have a B average. One reason why a student may have a C average is because it's in a subject they struggle with. Personally, I'm not very good with science. The past few years I've been getting C's, and I would have been devastated if i couldn't play the sport I wanted.

Another reason why a student may have a C average is because of stress at home. Many children, kids, and teens stress at home because of a death in the family, a divorce between parents, or may be their parents are just plain jerks. I feel I am lucky to say none of these go on in my home.

I do understand some reasoning for why you want students to have a B average to play sports. Some students try to depend on sports for getting them jobs or into colleges, so they decide to slack off in subjects.

Although I still believe a B average is too high. A C seems to be much more in the middle of grading. A's and B's are the spectacular grades, and D's and F's are the not so spectacular grades, and a C is just in the center.

In the end i do realize you make the decision of the grade needed, but I would be pleased if you would just take my words into consideration.

7600F1C7D884," In today's world, technology has made it easier for students to learn from home. However, I believe that attending classes in person provides numerous benefits that cannot be replicated through remote learning.

Firstly, being taught face-to-face allows for a more interactive and engaging learning experience. Students can ask questions, clarify doubts, and receive immediate feedback from their teachers. This type of interaction helps students to better understand the material and retain it for longer periods of time. Additionally, face-to-face learning allows for a more collaborative environment, where students can learn from each other and work together on group projects.

Secondly, attending classes in person provides a sense of community and belonging. Students are surrounded by their peers and teachers, which can help to reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness. This sense of community can also provide a support network for students, where they can share their struggles and receive encouragement from their peers and teachers.

Thirdly, attending classes in person provides a structured learning environment. Students are required to attend classes at specific times and follow a set schedule, which can help to promote discipline and responsibility. This structure can also provide a sense of routine and predictability, which can be beneficial for students who may struggle with time management or organization.

In conclusion, while remote learning has its advantages, attending classes in person provides numerous benefits that cannot be replicated through technology. Face-to-face learning allows for a more interactive and engaging learning experience, provides a sense of community and belonging, and promotes discipline and responsibility.

We are not voting for our own president, but choosing an electorss for our own state to go on and help us vote for our United States of America's president,but with an Electoral College every state get two Senators and one House of Representatives. Which divide everything equally. Our votes are counted by our population of people. So, the Electoral College shouldn't be change.

Mainly, Electoral College help us vote for our president. In the source ""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register assert that the winner of the president is ""election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The more popular votes our states is given the higher chance that president is going to be elected.

Who or what created this ""face"" on Mars? Was it aliens, or just nature doing its thing? The answer has been debated ever since it was discovered and the truth has been found. Although there's proof out there like the picture that was taken ten times better than the Viking's pictures, skilled scientist themselves don't even think it could be made by aliens, and there are similar landforms on Earth some people still find ways to argue. These people might say ""the markings were hidden under the haze, but just as much as that could be true it could also be wrong. This ""face"" was created by none other than Mother Nature herself.

To start, the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001 were much clearer than the original Viking pictures and unmask the face for what it really is. In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it states, ""...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos."" To illistrate, the article is saying that this new picture was so much better and much more revealing. The day this picture was taken (April 5, 1998) was completely cloudless. This means that there couldn't have been any alien markings hidden somewhere. Garvin said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size..."" He's hinting that even small things that show us there was civilization there could've been seen in this picture. To conclude, the new picture was proof to the world that this was just a landform.

Not only did a picture tell us this was no sign of alien life on Mars, but so did skilled scientists. When the picture was first taken, ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" We all know that scientists know their stuff so why doubt them? Their first intsinct was that it was just another landform, so why can't we all just agree with them and get on with our lives to worry about something more important? Even the caption for the picture (when it was released for everyone to see) noted that it was just a huge rock formation. So why can't we just see this ""face"" for what it is?

Lastly, there are landforms on Earth just like it. They're called mesas or buttes. Garvin says that "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of Mars."" If these landforms can naturally occur on Earth can't they also occur on Mars? Garvin sees that this landform is just like something we have at our own home.

Some people might say that when the picture was taken of the ""face"" in 1998 that it was probably cloudy that day and some alien markings were probably just covered up by the clouds. They must have done a lot of research because normally April is a cloudy time on the Red Planet, but that day was completely clear and ""sunny"". These people might just be the kind who believe in the supernatural and say that they've been ""obducted by aliens"". There is much more proof to this face being a natural landform compared to it being a alien made landmark. Where one side would say that ""scientists don't believe there is a chance of this"" the other side would say it was cloudy the day that picture was taken. Overall, there is no excuse for the fact that this is naturally occuring.

All in all, this face is a natural landform that has nothing to do with extra terrestrial life on Mars. There is proof behind it like the picture taken in 1998, the fact that actual scientists don't think there's any chance of it being alien related, and there are landforms like this one on Earth called a butte or mesa.

20c62af5,"It is often said that ""change is good."" This saying is one way to describe my feelings towards the Electoral College.

Posner show the pros and cons of the Electoral College. The Electoral College should be taken over by popular votes because all Americans should have a say in who their next leader will be.

The Electoral Collegemay disregard what their voters say and vote for another candidate to be our next President. In paragraph 11 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it is declared that ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate."" Voting citizens of America vote for a reason. They vote for who they want to be President, not who the party's electives want to be President. Voters should be able to trust their electors, otherwise their votes are going to a candidate they voted against. Another key point of this unjust way of voting is that people have to put their trust into unknown electors. It is stated in paragraph 16 of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner ""each of the party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee."" These electors may be ""trusted"", but to the unknowing voters of America they are ordinary people who could betray someone very easily. All it takes is one elector disobeying his promise to the candidate he chose to represent to have the fate of American changed.

The winner of the election may lose by popular vote and win by electoral votes. This is an unfair advantage that the Electoral College has to the common voters. Voters expect to vote for who they selected, not who the Electoral College selects. It is emphasized in paragraph 10 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer in which ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors."" In simpler terms, this is saying you don't vote for the next leader, you vote for people who may choose the next leader. The people of America vote for a reason, to choose our next leader who will support our country. They don't vote to have a College of unknown Electors choose the next President. It should also be noted that you're technically not even voting for a President. It is disputed in paragraph sixof ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" In other words, you don't even choose your candidate, just people who are trusted to vote for them. American voterswant to for the nex president, not a board of Electors that they are unsure will trust them.

On the contrary, there is the possibility of it being a very close election where it would require the Electoral College to choose a President. In paragraph 18 of the source ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""Richard A. Posnerstates ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The popular vote might be back and forth between the Presidents, but an electoral vote would create more of a landslide win. In the end, the cons of the Electoral College outweigh the pros of it.

The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing our country's next leader. The change of this ancient voting would be a very good and appreciatef one.If America really let the people of America choose, they would let the popular vote be the deciding factor for our next President of the United States.",0,train_essays,,3
DAFC6168319E,"Most likely im in a car every day of my life and the odds are so are you. But What if cars were never invented how many lives would be saved? how much money could we save? And over all how much better and cleaner our world will be. These things are just some of the advanatges that pertains to limiting our car usage. Have you ever heard of the good out weighs the bad? well in this situation the good defiantly out weighs the bad.

Our life source is breathing we need to breath air and at that fresh air, but we never are, not with fumes from millions of cars roaming around. Stated in (source3 par24) ""Its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution"". That to me sounds like two gains already, whats better than fresh air and less stress. Things just as simple as car pooling makes the world better but what really would is not useing you'r car daily. No, i dont mean walk every where you could use bikes, eletric operated golf carts which are all fun but much better for the air. By useing these we have fewer fumes in the air which makes for better air. If we all began useing these instead of cars in just towns it would become normal to ride bikes and, golf carts rather than big bulky air killing machines. For an example in (source4 par29) ""Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". It just starts with one to make something drastically change. Now i know were not gonna take family bike trips all the way from florida to georgia or drive a golf cart that only goes to 40mph,but thats when it would be decent to make a ""car trip"". Im not saying stop useing cars completely just only when its not neccassary. Just think about the world you live in the world that God has created is being pulluted every day, but we can all change that.

Money, money ,money Seems to be the big talk in America weather its the money were making, the money were loseing ,or the money we just dont have. But Wouldent you rather put your money towards the mouths of your family or the roof over your head, rather than in your gas tank ? Useing less cars would give us more money on more important things in life and, would cause more people to become happier . Just by useing things like bikes can make things more smoother in your every day life for an example(source3 par28) ""Rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"". No one i know loves sitting or, nearly wrecking during traffic with this mehtod of less cars we could cut deaths and, stress in half . And i know you would say, but millions of people would lose jobs big money by car usage being reduced,but think of all the new things they could make their money from . People are always looking for the next big thing , well this is it. Dealerships that promote this could now turn into safer mobility shops and, make nearly as much. Stated in(source4 par32) ""Americans could not afford new cars and the unemployed wernt going to work anyway"". This goes to show that were already leaning towards the idea of less cars we just need to be pushed. All the new inventions that will arise weather its cute bicycle covers to built in tops to block the rain people will be gaining and saving just as much. But what were really gainig is the saftey of people. Kids fall off their bikes everyday and probably get hurt but, a scrape is better than taking your last breath. We all gain from this , and our human nature is to want whats best for yourself, well this is surely better for every one.

Almost every day im in a vehicle, but maybe that could soon change. We could gain so much from losing just a little bit of driving time. We would absolutley gain lives,money,and happiness from useing less car usage. Im a firm beliver in useing this method i couldent imagine a better world of things going just so smoothly all of the time. But It takes getting on that bike or walking to the corner store to strike a revolution like this. So get out of your cars and, go make a better place for you and for the world.                                                                                                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
A8FD11F16108,"This painting is was made a long time ago. Many people found this painting weird because, back then there wasn't a lot of people happy, also poor. So when you see this picture this girl is happy and looks like she has nice cloths on. People took this picutre into inspiration. And brought a lot to the picture.

In my perceptative I like this idea but then I don't. It is pretty nice that we have a software that can be able to do something like this. it is pretty cool to tell people that we need a picture of you or someone and we will see how happy you are, how mad you are, etc. But I'm really not for it that much. There can be more things we can do instead of doing this. But doing this picture was preety cool.

In paragrpah 5 it states that people can tell how your friend is feeling simply by the look on their face. I totally agree with it. If this is your best friend and they are the same to you when you see each other you should smile. But when they don't and still look down then you know there is a problem. Friends are there for each other.

One thing that I argue about this is on paragrpah 6. When you are happy then when a ad pops up then it should be happy. Same way if you were mad then a mad or something down ad will pop up. I don't really agree to this because when people see ads they dont really pay attention to ads. When they see an ad they look at the close button for it and they close it. But if there is an advertisment they of coarse people will have to watch it until the ad is over. I don't like the idea that computers should have computer appresions on what we do.

This article is very good. I like this but of coarse there are some down falls to everything. I like how they did this software on ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" becuase this picture inspired other people. But the computer expressions isn't a good idea. They aren't doing this for a good cause. When people have a chance to skip an ad or an advertisment they will. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
F584D9BB5F5C,""" Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had a positive or negative affects on people's lives?"". As we know, technology has became one of the most important things in our lives, and people now are abusing the use of technology and forgetting to contact with the others around them. Although it has both positive and negative affects on people, but we cannot declaim that our lives have been easier and better since we have had techonlogy.

First, technology are used everyday by people at all ages because of its functions. We can complete many things online by using technology such as study, entertain, shopping, etc. For example, students use technology to serve for their learning like stuyding online or researching important things for their lessons. Lots of people also use it to play game, chat with their friends, or shopping online to relax after a hard-working day.

With technology, we can find and do almost things we need so we can save our times and will have more times to do the other activities like spending time with family, or hanging out with friends.

Second, technology helps us adpot hot problems, new informations of society faster and easier. We can read news on the websites, or watch the agenda to update more things everyday so we can have better knowlegde about things around us. Besides, many poor people have been helped by the others because the news about them have been shared wide-spread. This showed the major of technology and the care of people give to the others.

Many people said the use of technology has the limitation of human contact, and it's not all right. We can easily contact to the others by texting, calling as technology is developing . Using technology in general and social media in particular also can help us make friends. People often use Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat to add friends over the world and follow them. It is a best way to know our friends, family members' activities without asking because we don't have too much time to speak with them everyday. Otherwises, we still have to speak face to face to the others as much as possible so we can understand them better, and it also shows our care to them.

Not only technology, everything in the world also has both positive and negative sides, and the main idea is ourselves. If we use technology for the right purposes, and can limit the time of using it, technology will be very useful to our lives. In short, technology can limit human contact or not based on us so let's try using it as limited as we can and don't forget to use it right ways, right times, and right purposes.",0,original_moth,Task: Write an essay exploring the effects of technology on human contact and the lives of people.

3A00AE848492,"The Face of Mars isn't a face at all! It's just the shadows that gives the eyes, nose and mouth a look. It could be possible for the aliens to create the Face of Mars but it'll take ages for the aliens to perform a task like that. The Face of Mars is only a Natural Landform that has been around Mars since it was created.

The Face of Mars is located in Cydonia in Mars. Since Mars is mostlikely cloudy, the photos were taken when Mars was cloudless and was in open in Cydonia. MGS had took enough pictures during those times when it cloudless. Pictures were taking for many reasons. One of the reasons was for taxpayers. Jim Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, wanted this to happen for profit. But, some other reasons were to learn about Mars and it's surroundings for the next ship to travel there.

It really wasn't build by aliens nor any other creature out in space. The Face of Mars was made 25yrs ago. No one knows how it was made but it was located in Cydonia on Mars.

The Face, however, is an illusion using the shadows as the eyes, mouth, and the nose. One day in Sept. 1997, MGS, or Mars Global Surveyor, had landed onto the Red Planet had confirmed it as a natural landform. Not everyone was satisfied since they wanted more proof for this. It was April '98, cloudy time of year on Mars, where people couldn't use their telescopes to see the Face for themselves. So, on April 8th, 2001, MGS gotten close enough for another look. They've took another picture using a better camera that could see anything clear like a airplane, a truck, or a Egyptian-style pyramids! Once they've gotten the picture, People were satisfied.

Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face.

EBCDED6944ED,"People have been battling to find the best learning method, which can serve humankind well and move us closer to the future. One of the ideas out there is distance learning, an option for students to attend classes from home and to learn by watching online videos. But does this method work? No. Distance learning is one step backward from the future because it is not the most effective way of learning, it decreases the work rate of students, and it causes mental health issues for both students and educators.

First of all, distance learning is not the most effective way of learning. So what is the most effective way? Face-to-face learning, or also known as observational learning. Scientists and psychologists proved that it is the most effective way of learning. How come? Let's visit the past. Thousands and millions of years ago when human first developed, our first learning way is to learn face-to-face. We drew symbols in caves, made fires, hunted animals, and grew crops, all thanks to observational learning. But observational learning has proved its magic on other occasions as well. For example, the famous experiment called Bobo Doll, conducted by Albert Bandura, had shown us that children are more likely to copy the behaviors of adults when they are presence. It is the first learning way children are exposed to at a very young age. Some will argue that they can learn by observing the actions online, so the traditional way of learning is unnecessary. It doesn't work that way. Psychologists proved that students are more likely to remember information if they are in the appropriate environment, which is the classroom. When students can remember information, it means they can perform the given tasks well.

Second of all, distance learning decreases the work rate of students. Not every students are alike. Some work hard no matter what, some prefer not to. By offering the option of distance learning to students, they will take advantages of the technology and most students will choose the ""online"" way to make their life easier; consequently, distance learning will results in laziness, lacks of motivation to strive for the best, and low employment rate in the future. On the other hand, students who are used to observational learning will do much better in life compared to those who prefer online learning. Scientists said people who prefer observational learning will be more open-minded, more forgetful, and higher chances of succeeding in life.

Last of all, distance learning causes mental health issues for both students and educators. If distance learning is widely used, it will results in the lack of communication between peers and educators, which means students and teachers don't get the best experience and relationships between them will be weak. The main point of education is to make students understand lessons and to collaborate with peers. If there is no collaboration, there is no meaningful relationships. In this modern world, collaboration beats the technology. We got here because of collaboration, so why would we do such things to turn students away from collaborating with others? People said that they want to change the educational system. They said by offering distance learning, it is one big step for humankind toward the future and it benefits students. But is the ""big step"" they said worth it? No. We, as humans, do not need distance learning. Observational learning has served us well and make miracles come to life. For example, Neil Armstrong took the big step for humankind, thanks to observational learning and the appropriate environment that NASA chose to follow. Steve Jobs did the same, thanks to observational learning. Former President Barack Obama made history as becoming the first African-American president of the United States, thanks to the observational learning. He won voters by talking directly to them. That is not the magic you can replicate through a computer screen.

Students deserves the best education because they are the future of humankind. Although they are only 20% of the world's populations, but they are 100% of our future. You want to make history, history is already there to guide you. Don't make the unnecessary change, let the past embraces us, teaches us lessons, and sticks to the traditional way of learning. I don't have faith in our educational system, but I have faith in humans. Distance learning are one step backward from the future. ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

A46DA0EA4F5D,"Advantages and Disadvantages of Four-Day School Weeks

In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards four-day school weeks. While proponents of this idea argue that it has numerous benefits, others believe that it will have negative consequences. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of a four-day school week, and discuss potential solutions to any potential problems that may arise.

One of the main advantages of a four-day school week is that it would give students more time for extracurricular activities. With an extra day off each week, students would have more time to participate in sports, music, clubs, and other activities that they enjoy. This could lead to increased engagement and motivation, as students would have more opportunities to pursue their passions outside of the classroom.

Another advantage of a four-day school week is that it would give teachers more time to plan and prepare for their lessons. With an extra day off each week, teachers would have more time to collaborate with their colleagues, reflect on their teaching practices, and develop new strategies for engaging students. This could lead to more effective teaching and better student outcomes.

However, there are also potential disadvantages to a four-day school week. One of the main concerns is that it could negatively impact student learning. With fewer days in the school week, teachers would have less time to cover all of the material they need to teach. This could lead to rushed lessons, inadequate instruction, and a decrease in the quality of education.

Another potential disadvantage of a four-day school week is that it could put additional stress on parents. With their children out of school for an extra day each week, parents would need to find alternative childcare arrangements. This could be difficult and expensive, and could put additional strain on working parents.

To address these potential disadvantages, schools could implement a number of solutions. For example, they could reduce the amount of homework assigned to students, or they could provide additional resources and support for parents to help them find childcare. Additionally, schools could work to ensure that teachers have the time and resources they need to plan and prepare for their lessons, even with a shorter school week.

In conclusion, a four-day school week has both advantages and disadvantages. While it could give students more time for extracurric",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,5

There are also other types of way to attend classes at your home. For example, taking it online and video conferencing with your teacher and others from that school. And it is much more easier in a regular school.

Firstly, taking classes at home is much more comfortable than taking classes at school. Therefore, you can relax, not be tense, and not being afraid to ask questions. It is much easier to handle than a regular school.

Secondly, you're much more focus there are no one to annoy you, making such noise, or hearing somebody else talking about other stuff whether it is important or not. It is much more quieter than any of the room you've been in and your head is on the right point.

Thirdly, you don't need to worry about troubles unless you're slacking no, i'm talking about bullies those brats who always pick on the weak. Their head is not the right pont where they por they're anger all to you.

My opinion on this statement is distance learning is not beneficial, Certain kids take advantage of online schooling to not attend school and to stay at home. Most few kids can't learn their material through computer and prefer being in a classroom and being taught verbally. Everyone's learning skills are different.

Online classes are like books on a computer and having to learn all your materials on your own. Attending school will help you learn more things about all your subjects. When having trouble with any subject you will have teachers and other students to go to when needed help.

Distance learning may effect your social life. Socializing with other student's at school is a great way to make friends. Going to school and having a routine every morning will help you to be independent and having you'r own responsibilities, it will prepare you as you get older.

Doing online classes won't be like going to school where they give you opportunity's to go on field trips and have fun at the dances or participating in sports and clubs.

I personality will like to have technology to read my emotional expressions . it would be fun to have that in school .

It shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when your're happy or sad. ''The same technology can make computer- animated faces more expressive - for video games or video surgery'' said Dr,Huang.

Dr. Huang and his colleague experts are developing better ways for humans and computer to communicate. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscules. It haves Six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associasted each with characterisctic movments of the facial muscles.

This is how it works It's all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smlie and a forced one.

Muscles are called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes.(That's instruction #2.)

C9B989E27414,"Having a positive attitude has been long seen to be a contributing factor in achieving success. Numerous examples abound that demonstrate how individuals have used their optimism and determination to triumph over difficult situations and accomplish their goals.

For instance, Vera Wang began her career as an editor at Vogue, with dreams of designing her own clothing line. Despite the rejections she received, with determination, she landed a job with Ralph Lauren, where she learned the business of design. Eventually, she was able to achieve her dream of launching her own line of luxury clothing that women of all shapes and sizes had access to. This meant challenging the conventional thinking of the industry (Ref 1).

David Letterman has been an example of the positive power that comes from becoming a self-made success. From his early efforts working on radio in early 1970's, Letterman's positive attitude carried him to a long and illustrious career spanning five decades in television as a talk show host and producer. Mr. Letterman attributed his success to “the desire, energy and luck,” along with “a hell of a good attitude” (Ref 2).

Oprah Winfrey is another example of success driven by a positive attitude. In her early years, she overcome poverty, sexual abuse and societal obstacles to become a national television star. Later, as the face of the media brand OWN, Ms. Winfrey used her platform to showcase inspirational stories, teach life lessons and empower her viewers (Ref 3).

In all these examples, it was their positive attitude that allowed them to succeed despite daunting obstacles. With diligence and flexibility, these individuals developed a can-do spirit that attracted people to support them and their dreams.

First, cultivating a positive attitude promotes better physical health. Those with a positive outlook are less likely to experience stress-related physical problems, such as headaches and muscle tension. Additionally, research has found that positive thinking contributes to an improved sense of self-worth, which can inspire a healthier lifestyle.

Secondly, having a positive attitude can improve our relationships with those around us. By approaching situations with optimism, we can become better communicators and problem solvers. We are also less likely to come off as defensive or aggressive -- traits that can make it difficult to form trusting relationships. 

Finally, with a positive attitude, we are more likely to be successful in our studies and careers. It has been proven that people who think positively are more likely to see difficult tasks as a challenge and thereby take them on with enthusiasm. As a result, those individuals are more likely to reach their desired goals.

D38A46B22248,"Summer is the time of year where students all over the world finally get to relax. They do not have to worry about any responsibilities; they can just remember what it means to be a kid. However, some schools are allowed to assign projects over summer. If kids are required to constantly be thinking about school and work, they should at least be enjoying it. Students should self design any projects assigned over summer because its their own free time, everyone has unique learning styles, and teachers aren't always considerate.

Children care about their summer vacations, because it is the only time they are truly free. A student looks forward to this vacation throughout the whole school year. They wait patiently, completing every assignment and every test, just so they can play outside in the summer sunshine. These kids don't want to finally get out of school to only have to complete yet another assignment. If the kids are having to do this project on their own break, they should at least be able to choose what they do. For example, if a student is assigned a project over summer from biology, they should be able to pick to do an animal studies on their own dog. An animal they know well, love, and actually would enjoy researching. Kids having to spend their vacation working should be able to choose what to work on.

Kids want to play, so they should be able to and have a project that adapts to their learning style. Every student learns differently. Having a project created by one teacher would be unfair to everyone else who doesn't think the same way. Allowing students to have some decision in what they do would be most effective in actually teaching them. Every mind learns differently and needs creative thinking involved to begin working. If kids were allowed to come up with their own projects, it would be much better than a teacher-designed project. The kids would not think of it as homework, but instead as something they want to do.

Teachers don't always know whats best for their students. Many teachers may just assign homework because they need more grades in the grade book. They don't always consider if it's necessary for the students learning. They don't think about the stress that homework inflicts on it's victims. If teachers were to create a project for students to complete over summer, it would cause lots of stress and resentment. Although, letting the kids design their own projects would help build a better bond between kids and learning. Teachers would then get a better feel for each student and see how each of their individual minds work. Letting kids design their own projects would also reduce the amount of work and stress teachers have to endure. Having to come up with a project that would be easy for every student to complete is hard as it is. Having to do this before a teachers own vacation is just torture. It would be a win win situation if the kids got to design the project.

If it was required that a kid got a summer project, it should be student designed. Kids are not thrilled about getting homework over their vacation, and they may not put their best effort. However, If the kids had the option to create their own project it would spark much more creativeness. Teachers would better understand their students and get a break from all the regulating.

Students would have more time to study, or do homework because they could start school later on the day, or students could start early it depends on how the students feel. Students would feel better if they had a better rest, or knowing they could do school whatever time they feel good.

The students would get less distracted if they learned from home because they are not around their friend or peers, who are usually a distraction. Of course the students will get bored of being alone while doing school but it's better for them to stay focused on what they are doing, and plus they have a better understanding on what they are doing if the students don't get distracted. The students would be more dedicated on the homework's, tests, or projects because they would understand a lot more if they are not distracted by their friends.

The students would learn a lot more if they are comfortable for example people pay more attention when they are in their rooms on their beds or when at their house. Students would rather sit on a comfortable chair rather than a school chair because when your sitting on the same chair everyday your body starts to hurt, or you don't feel comfortable sitting in that position.

Students should have the opportunity to attend school from home because its more beneficial for them, they have a better timing, they are more comfortable when working from home, and they would get less distracted from other students.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Pros and Cons of Schools Controlling Extracurricular Activities

Schools play a significant role in shaping our lives, and one of the ways they do this is by controlling the involvement of extracurricular activities. While some people argue that schools should have complete control over these activities, others believe that it's important for students to have some freedom to choose their own interests. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of schools controlling extracurricular activities.

One of the pros of schools controlling extracurricular activities is that it helps students stay focused on their academic goals. By limiting the number of extracurricular activities available, schools can ensure that students are not overwhelmed with too many commitments. This can help students prioritize their studies and avoid falling behind in their schoolwork. Additionally, schools can ensure that the extracurricular activities they offer are relevant to the students' academic goals, such as sports teams that help improve physical fitness or music clubs that enhance musical skills.

Another pro of schools controlling extracurricular activities is that it can help promote school spirit and unity. By offering a limited number of activities, schools can encourage students to participate in the ones that interest them the most. This can create a sense of community and school pride, as students are more likely to be engaged in activities that they enjoy. Moreover, schools can use these activities as a way to bring students together and promote school events, such as sports games or concerts.

However, there are also some cons of schools controlling extracurricular activities. One of the main cons is that it can limit students' freedom to choose their own interests. By offering only a few activities, schools may not be able to cater to the diverse interests of their students. This can lead to students feeling uninspired and disengaged from their schoolwork. Moreover, schools may not be able to accommodate students who have unique interests that don't fit into the limited number of activities offered.

Another con of schools controlling extracurricular activities is that it can create a competitive atmosphere. By limiting the number of activities available",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay discussing the pros and cons of schools controlling the involvement of extracurricular activities.,3

People who ask other people what their opinion is, can help that person decide on what he/she wants to do. Opinions can have good or bad things to say about the subject they are talking about, and opinions vary in manykinds of ways depending on the persons aspect of the subject. When people discuss about something in groups, they have multiple aspects that a person can take and see how the subject would be a good or bad idea. The way people see things will affect their opinions and aspects of their situation.

When someone is trying to find a reliable tool, they usaully look for the most rated items, because the higher the ratings are the most liked and most used. When somethin has low to no ratings, then that means that it is either not liked or not used. So my conclusion on one opinion means one aspect or idea about the subject, and multiple opinions mean more opinions which means more aspects or ideas about the subject.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
74CE2F003968,"Online classes are becoming increasingly popular, especially for students with work and family responsibilities, as well as those who are ill or disabled. In my opinion, taking classes online offers numerous benefits for these groups of students.

First and foremost, online classes provide flexibility and convenience for students with work and family responsibilities. Traditional classes require students to attend classes at a specific time and location, which can be challenging for students who have to balance their studies with their work and family obligations. Online classes, on the other hand, can be accessed at any time and from any location with an internet connection, allowing students to complete their coursework on their own schedule. This flexibility is especially important for students who may have to miss classes due to work or family commitments.

Another benefit of online classes is that they provide a more comfortable and familiar learning environment for students who are ill or disabled. Traditional classes can be challenging for students who have mobility or cognitive impairments, as they may have to navigate a busy classroom and interact with their peers in person. Online classes, however, can be accessed from the comfort of one's own home, eliminating the need to navigate a physical classroom and allowing students to focus on their studies without distractions. Additionally, online classes often provide additional accommodations and support for students with disabilities, such as text-to-speech functionality and closed captions.

Furthermore, online classes can also provide a more personalized learning experience for students who are ill or disabled. Traditional classes often have a one-size-fits-all approach, which can be challenging for students who have unique learning needs. Online classes, on the other hand, can be tailored to the individual student's needs, providing a more personalized and effective learning experience. For example, students with learning disabilities may be able to access additional resources and support, such as tutoring and accommodations, through their online classes.

In conclusion, online classes offer numerous benefits for students with work and family responsibilities, as well as those who are ill or disabled. They provide flexibility and convenience, a comfortable and familiar learning environment, and a more personalized learning experience. As technology continues to advance, online classes are likely to become even more accessible and effective, providing a valuable option for students who may have previously been",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Write an essay discussing the benefits of taking classes online for students with work and family responsibilities, as well as those who are ill or disabled.",9
F47A4FDF687E,"There are a lot of obese children in this generation. You cannot take away sports even if their grades are low. It is unfair and we need to exercise. We need P.E. because it is important for a lot of unhealthy children!! We need all the exercise and fun. If we don't exercise then we will continue to be obese and lazy. Not having exercise isn't going to make us do better on our grades! Being healthy helps us focus, eat better, and concentrate more on our grades. Trust me, those who aren't getting exercise won't have better grades. Even if you only give the Grade A and B averages exercise it wouldn't be fair for all the other students that have low grades. It wouldn't be fair whatsoever. This is uncalled for, just ripping away exercise to kids who need it, but have extremely low grades! You should be ashamed of yourself for even considering not letting kids have what they need! Sure lot's of people say you don't NEED exercise, but honestly we all do actually need it. We need to have the running, and strength that our gym teachers provide us. And just forcing it away because of lousy grades, which we can fix easily, is just cruel!

Gym helps build muscles. When you take it away because of grades, not only are you letting kids become obese, but you are also taking away what strengthens them. Their legs won't be any good because they will be too weak. They can hurt themselves when they finally get good grades and randomly start exercise. They need to start from the beginning like everyone else to build up strength like everyone else. Don't take away what we need the most. I beg of you, do NOT take away our exercise, strength, and fun! Its cruel and unusual punishment to make a child suffer! We are suffering when we aren't getting exercise! Obesity is striking America everywhere! When you take away sports then you are just helping the obesity problem grow!! Please don't do this! For the sake of us, the kids! Don't take away what we hold dearest! We cannot help it if we aren't good in math or algebra! Instead of taking away things, get special classes for after school, make time for a study hall and send the kids that need a little help to a class for extra learning. But taking away sports is just plain unfair!! Listen to reason and don't go through with this plan.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Yes, they are, walking is good for you, good for the mind and soul, many people these day, rather walk that take a car. Many say it helps the enviorment, which helps us back. Alot of people also say public transportation, is great, and cheap way to get from point A to point B. Like stated in

Source 4 , the end of car culture has come, due to new and inovating things.

Like stated in

Source 1 , ""When i had a car I was alwas tense. Im much happier this way"". Many people these days live in suburbs and have things like stores close to them, so they dont have to walk far, so they prefer not driving and just walking instead. Now in cities like Vauban, there is quiet and a more. Like stated in

Source 1 , ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car and that will have to change"", these ideas are outdated and will have to change due to the high greenhouse gas emissions throughout Europe and the Americas.

Like stated in

Source 1, 2 and 4 , The United States and Europe have large dense cities with very high greenhouse emissons. Thats why they have proposed Hybrid cars ane put bans on cars in cities when pollution is to great. Like stated in

Souce 2, and 3 they have fined anyone who uses their cars. Paris the capital of France has a smog problem, when cold air at night and warm air in the day cause pollution to stay, city officals, let citizens use the public transport for free, to help promote public transport and fix the smog issues. This also took the stress out of citizens who thought they wouldnt make it to work.

Like stated in

Source 4 , Young people don't really care for driving anymore, if they go out with friends they carpool, or just find a place to hang out which is close. Like stated in

Source 1,2,3,4 people are happier, Even people with cars prefer using public trasport, for example Mr. Sivak's son has a car but uses the Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART. Even if it takes him a longer time to get there. Young people have especially stop caring for driving. A study last year, has found out driving in young people has decreased by 23 percent from 2001 to 2009, proving that driving is becoming less popular.

In the end, Driving was very popular, but now due to inovations and humanity's relationship with nature, we have begun to give up on something that gave us joy. Even an Executive Chairman from Ford motor company, has come to the realization that vehicle ownership is impratical and indesirable, in this point in time. Even the famous motor company's have to realize that the tables have turned and in is in favor of less pollution, and more people on the streets walking or taking public transit. . Today, people want to lower their stress and increase their happiness. Today, we want to lower the pollution and increase safety, to help us and nature.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
FAF7BA5CEB25,"So driverless cars are coming and what is your opinion on them? Do yo think they are a good thing? Do you think they are a bad thing. I'm here to tell you why I think driverless cars are a good thing for people.

First of all, speed limit would be followed by everyone. Usually people don't drive the speed limit. If driverless cars happen, then we can make them go the speed limit. I think going the actual speed limit will reduce car accidents.

Second of all, the person in the car could still take control of the vehicle if needed. This is a good thing because if a turn or park is to difficult for the car itself, then the driver can take control and do the obstacle for the car. This will prevent the car from malfunctioning.

Finally, I think it will make it easier on a lot of people. If someone is handicapped the car is there to just drive for them if they can't drive for a long time. I also personally think it will reduce accidents because of how fast you are going.

In conclusion, Driverless cars are coming and while there are downsides, I feel that positive overweighs the negative. That is why I am for driverless cars. Do you think they are good thing for people?",0,persuade_corpus,,3

The main cause why we should abstain ourselves from car usage is to reduce air pollution. Paris is one of the most European capitals that has the most smog in the city. Due to the excess of air polluted, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear out the city. If we take efforts forward, greenhouse gas emisssions can decrease.

The advantages we take of limiting car usage is less congestion on the streets, ride our bikes or go walking which is very healthy too.""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"" (source number 3).

Unmasking the Face on Mars is talking about how some people discused how it was created by aliens and other scientist just say it is a natural landform and i agree.

May 24 2001 tenty five years ago NASAs space craft found a shadowy likeness of a human face . Scientist believe that it is a natural based lanform called a Martian messa common enough around Cydonia . A few days later NASA unveiled it for all to see. Now few scientist think their is an alien artifact, but they are wrong.

As soon as word got out on April 5th 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time.

They snaped a picture ten times sharper than the originak viking photo . Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the JPL website to show the picture scientist revealed the picture as a natural landform there was no alien monument after all , stated in paragraph 7 .

There was no evidence of there ever being an alien just a historical landform that was a familiar to a humans face . But people were still not satisfied about the research .

2EAE515F6F39,"Multiple opinions can help people decide on what to do. When asking for an opinion you might want to ask more than one person because the person you ask might have better advice than the other person. Another reason is that people could have different personal opinions and points of view than others and their advice could help you out a lot in the future.

When you ask for someones opinion you should listen carefully to what they have to say. Some people have better advise than others. I think people should ask more than juts one or two people for advice because people may have different points of view from others and you could agree with one or more people on something. If you only listen to one persons advice them you would have not known what other people had to say. The person you did not ask could have had really good advice but you would never know because you only asked one person. When ever I need advice I ask at least three people to see what they would say and what kind of advice they would give me. I listen closely to what they say and their advice could help me later. I listen to what everyone says and I think about what could benefit me either now or in the future.

Like I said before people have their own opinions so if someone gives you advice that you do not agree with and you get upset just remember that everyone does not think exactly like you. People have their own personal opinions and they will sometimes tell you something that you do not like or want to hear . Now if someone gave you advice that you do not like do not ignore it take it as constructive criticism and listen to what they say and have a open mind about it. For example: Lets say you made some food and you add a little to much salt and your friend tells you that it is was to salty and that maybe you should have added less salt but you find the food to taste just right. Next time maybe dont add as much salt. This way you listen to your friends advice even though you disagree and if you find it alright and if they find the food better then you both dont lose nothing. And theres other ways to deal with this situation like not cooking that meal, but you decided to listen to your friends advice and in the end it all worked out. Its ok if people have different opinions then you and their advice isnt what you would like to hear but its good that you learn from them.

In conclusion when seeking advice its good to ask more than one person because everyone is different and they will tell you different things. Some of those things could be bad advice but as long as you find the good in what everyone says and not just what one person says youll find the advice your looking for.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
16C808F5F642,"School is often learned to be a hated word by the youth of modern society. Every morning, students slug out of bed and dread the thought of stepping into the rigid building known as high school. Education is the gateway to a brighter future, but every day, when freedom is restricted, students become less motivated to learn. No music, no talking, no shorts, no colorful pens; everything that once made school an exciting place is sucked out making high school simply black and white. Every dull and depressed face in the hall is from the daily torture of forced and restricted learning. Online education gives students the opportunity to grow as a person and develop skills to carry with them when entering the real world. Unlike physically going to school, online classes provide the option to work freely at each student's own pace, learning in whatever style best suits them, and avoiding social stress associated with school.

Every individual learns at different paces and in different ways. It is nearly impossible for a teacher to match every single student's learning style and speed at the same time. If a teacher moves quickly to help more advanced students to reach their full learning potential, students that process information slower will get left behind. However, if a teacher moves slower, quick processors feel bored and don't gather as much information as they could. Taking an online class gives every student the freedom to move through information as fast or as slow as they feel. Everybody's learning style can be tailored through online learning by providing many options of learning such as at home labs, lecture videos, discussions, and visual presentations. Some students could even have the option to travel while taking classes to learn more from the world around them while still receiving background information.

A huge problem faced today by students is increased social anxieties that are mostly due to the exclusive social circle society moves in. Depression causes some students to feel hopeless in school and the loss of motivation takes a toll on their learning. If students find it easier to connect to a subject without getting social, online classes are the perfect solution. Each student can choose their exposure to social situations by talking virtually or avoiding people all together by using online notes and other provided tools.

The choice of every student to drag themselves to school everyday or wake up ready to learn can depend on the option to take learning into their own hands. Online learning is a choice and should be provided to more students to help each person reach their full potential. The future depends on today's youth, so why not let them learn to their full potential?",0,persuade_corpus,,3

62CF0CE1297D,"How do you think the Face was formed. There could be many reasons how the Face was formed. However I think that the Face was not formed by aliens. One reason is, is that they haven't prove that aliens are real yet. Also, that the day they took they picture they said that there was wispy clouds over it. Another reason is that it all happend because of science.

Mars is an odd planet, I've heard people call it the pizza planets because it was red, I think. That's not the point though, the point is, is that the planet has not proven that aliens live on that planet. The face had been thought it was created by aliens. NASA said that the Face was a ""huge rock formation"" showing the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. There are more reasons why they face was Face was not formed by aliens.

Another reason is that the day they took the picture, there was wispy winds. In order to take a good picture you need to have good weather. The weather can effect the picture because if it's windy you need to make sure that everything is not blowing around. The wispy winds could have effected the picutre becuase the winds were blowing so the rocks, sand and everything else was blowing around. So, when Viking 1 captured that picture, it can everything else blowing with it. Wind storms happen on planets, I am not sure om which ones but i know they happen-just like how on the sun it doesn't have wind storms but has almosr like volcanic action on it with lave everywhere. There is one more other reason.

One more reason is that is just plain old science. Science occurs in a lot of discussing and working on the planet. When planning to send some sort of machine to a planet, you have to undertand the planet. In 1976 there wasn't the best technology at the time. They didn't know when a storm was gonna come or if they would have to send their machines threw a bunch of metors. When they sent out Viking 1 a win storm occured and the camera on Viking 1 couldn't focus right and that is why it looked like a face.

There are many more reasons why the Face was not formed but an aliens. Some are that it was that aliens have not been proven yet. Also, that there was wispy clounds. One more is that is was all science. Those are resons why that the Face was not formed by aliens.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

There are many sports already which you need a G.P.A. for, which is good for many reasons because honestly you should be most focus on your school work then your sports but most kids would much rather be playing what they love, not at home doing math homework or any subject for that matter. Sports are a way to meet new people and see what your good at or want to do.

There are a lot of kids with the straight A' s that don't play spots. The kids who do have many things to do in the day, and school work usually comes last which makes things very easy to forget. Yes there are reminders for things like homework projects, but what about test and quizzes that can easily bring one of your B' s down and sadly no more sport now that doesn't seem too far. For kids to play sports these days there are high expectations and they have to fulfil them. Its not about winning or losing, but to most people it is.

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. ""When my draft board leaned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service."" By the timehee was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips (the most of any seagoing Cowboy).

But seeing Acropolis in Greece was special,"" he says. ""So was taking a gondla ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets made of water."" Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

I also found time to have fun on board, especially on retrun trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been held. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

9F1EEDC186E3,"Summer is a time of hanging out with friends at the beach and relaxing in the warm weather, but there is always something that swoops in to mess it up: a summer project. Summer projects are not all bad, for they are designed to ensure that students continue to learn during their three month getaway from school. However, who should design the summer project the student or the teacher? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have more experience with projects than students, and students will lean toward designing a quick and easy project.

Teachers have had more encounters with school assigned projects in their lifetime than their students. Most teachers have college degrees. They have done the twelve plus years of primary school to graduate, and then gone on to college and done two to four more years to get their degree. Through all that schooling many projects have been assigned and completed. All of this gives teachers the proper experience and background to come up with a well designed summer project for their students. Just this past summer my computer system networking teacher, Mr. Generic_Name, assigned us a project. It was a review project incorporating all of the course material from my sophomore year that he did not want us to forget during the summer. I remember how well rounded of a project it was, so much so that I had to ask him how he come up with it. Mr. Generic_Name told me that the project was inspired by all the projects he encountered during his four years at William and Mary. Due to Mr. Generic_Name having plenty of experience with higher education projects, it allowed him to design a well developed summer project for my peers and I. I can only imagine the toddler like projects that would have been produced if my peers and I were allowed to design our summer projects instead of Mr. Generic_Name.

More than likely if a student is given the opportunity to do less work they are going to take that opportunity. Throughout my years of high school I have seen this exact manner take place over and over. Students will take the easy way out by selecting courses that have a history of demanding very little from those enrolled. This same mannerism repeats itself once the student is enrolled in a course and it comes time to actually work. Just this past marking period my Math Analysis teacher, Mrs. Generic_Name, gave us a take home test for winter break. This test consisted of 47 problems. The more problems you did the higher grade you got, but students did not seem to take advantage of this. More than half of my class chose to only do 30 of the 47 problems. This was because completing 30 of the 47 problems earned the minimum for a passing grade, a 70 percent. My peers had full control of their grades and chose to only work for the minimum passing score so that the rest of their winter break would be free of math. This is what will occur if a student is allowed to design their own summer project. Once a student realizes that they get to design their project they will make it something simple, lousy, and childlike. The student will design something just good enough too pass, so that they can return to their more practical summer.

Some argue that a student would be more inclined to do their project if they got to design it. However, this is not true as someone's interest in something does not determine whether they will do it or not, but their work ethic is the true determining factor. Summer projects serve a meaningful purpose; to make sure kids maintain learning and strengthening their brains even when school is out. Something with a strong purpose like that should not be taken lightly and should be handled by someone who can produce the best project. This is why summer projects should be teacher-designed, so that students can take away as much information as possible when the project is all said and done.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
CBF62E8FFA1B,"In my opinion, I think that true self-esteem comes from achievement and the only reason I think that is because when I achieve something huge say I got a very good grade on my project or got an acceptance letter from my dream college, it would make me feel great about myself and raise my self-esteem. It does not come from praise, when I hear the word praise I think of people praising you and you shouldn't rely on people to bring your self-esteem up. To know that you did a good job by seeing the acheivement it makes a person feel like they can do anything. I see why they say praising can bring self-esteem up, it is because people love to hear from others how well they did or how what they did was so incredible. Words can bring self-esteem up and I know this from experience. However you do not need peoples words to build your self-esteem up it's more a want then a need. Achievement is what you need to build your confidence up in yourself not words, I mean sure it's nice to get a couple compliments here and there but not for satisfaction. To acheive is like to do something outside of your bubble to make you feel like you can do anything, effort needs to be put in to achieve. I think our society now expects that getting praised is like the best thing but those people are the ones who realize that in the end thats not something that build your self-esteem up, sure it'll make them feel good for a little bit, but in my head I thought you don't need to depend on anybody to satisfy you as long as you're doing you and succeeding in life. I hope people come to their senses and realize that they cannot live their lives happy and succesful being praised their whole life they need to praise themselves. I used to be a person who loved getting praised for doing a good job or achieveing something I never praised myself though I wanted to. I realized then the praising is not gonna get me through my teenager years, early twenties and late twenties, I had to learn on my own to know that if I put the effort in something I will achieve. I feel like this whole praising, effort, achievement thing is all like one big repeat, put in effort, praise to boost up your confidence and then in the end achieve it's all linked together but peoples words are not going to satisfy you throughout your academic life it's like asking for attention right there, give yourself all the attention to achieve in life not to fail, I have praised myself so much that I got so many positive thoughts in my head telling myself keep pushing,your almost there,your going to graduate as long as the achievement matches the effort put in to achieve. I've always been that child that wanted to make everybody around me proud especially my parents, I want to show the people that have doubted me my whole life that I can do anything I can achieve it's just all if I put in effort or not. True self-esteem comes from achievement not from praise and if I didn't know that in my heart as true I wouldn't be the person I am today, suceeding.",0,original_moth,"Task:

F3CB6601CF24,"I was stuck in between two decisions, live with my mom or live with my dad. I could ask for help, but would it make a difference if I didn't feel happy about it? Asking friends could lead to fights, and if I asked parents and step parents they would probably make it some emotional lesson. I decided to ask my uncle, Generic_Name, who could relate to me on many occasions. He said that it was up to me but he thought I would be happier at my dads house. It wasn't enough only being one person, so I went to my aunt, Generic_Name, who said my mom needed me more. I needed tie breaker. My last resort was my brother, Generic_Name. Although he was not close to me at all, he was honest with me and said that I should stay with my dad. He said that if I wanted to be mentally stable and not have my clothes carry the stench of smoke form cigarettes, dad was the right option.

They weren't all the same option but it was easier than me and one other person deciding. Because I got more than one persons opinion, I went down the right path.

I think asking advice from more than one person and seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Making a decision by yourself or with only one other person's opinion, can be damaging to the mind. If you are trying to make a decision and make a right choice, you are most likely always thinking about it. It always being on your mind leads to distress and you just made a one track mind. Your mind is not meant to only think of one subject, it needs to constantly be running with new ideas and thoughts. Your creativity relies on parts of your brain. You will, literally, go brain dead. School takes on a lot of thinking, but we have multiple subjects. Having multiple subjects means that your mind is switching between them and not on just one. You are supposed to challenge your brain, and you are supposed to let it win, not defeat it.

Another reason you should get more than one persons opinion is that the one person you choose could be manipulating you. If you ask for their opinion and they can see physically that your stressed, they will take advantage of that. They will take advantage of you by choosing the decision they want and not think of you. They have the high ground over you and you are willing to stay down.

It will benefit them, but have no effect, positive or negative, on you. It does not matter if your the one who brought it up, they are the stronger one because you are controlling your own mind into thinking that's okay. You can't fool your bodies actions but you can fool your mind into what ever you want it to be.

The last reason you should get more people's opinions is that you have someone to talk to. When you are in the decision making mindset, you are not aware of your surroundings. You are being held down by the stress that is being a burden to you. Your brain is feeling heavy and you are feeling wary. When you sit down with someone, you can set the burden down. You now are in the mindset of getting help from people. They will share their opinions, and then you move on to another. You don't even have to know that person, and the problem does't even have to be that big. Listening to their own opinions can help your own. Visually, physically, listening, you can find anyone's opinion.

Those are some of my reasons why getting opinions from other people can help someone make a better choice. People think that using your brain for a one act thing is okay. It's damaging to your thoughts and to your creativity. Once you get into the one set mind, it's very difficult to get out of it. People manipulating you is also not okay. You have the question, you ask it, you control it. Don't let anyone else control it. And lastly, talking to someone is essential to make the best decision. Why have all that stress on your back while you can just take it off. You have control over your brain, so don't ruin it.               ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
E110443F5184,"""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""Therefore,in my opinion character traits can be chose but it must show as true self that represent you. Why, let me tell you; every on has their own unique traits even the traits they get from their parent. lastly animal spirit do show has traits that represent as our character traits. Although,I do disagree with character traits with influences us that help improve our trait that can help us set right path.

Everyone has their own unique traits. Some people has traits like kindness,honesty,caring,and more. Unfourtely that some character traits can't be chose but sometime character traits chose you as your character traits .For example my character traits is pretty weird: kind honesty,helpful,caring,little crazy and lastly trickery like the fox. Same with parents has their own unique character traits;however, parents' character traits can be passed down to children base on their character traits and if they are worthy of the carry their parent's traits. For example,It remind me the time when I am all dressed up and got my hair done after that I look at the mirror; I notice that I look familiar at the time I realized that I look like mom. As poof that I do have my mom's gene meaning I have her physical look. As i explain even character trait and be passed down or chose have own character traits.

Next, everyone has their own spirit animal that is represent your character traits. For example if the person has the character trait which is playful,love water,caring,and fun loving as poof of this person character traits show their spirit animal is dolphin. Therefore, anyone can chose their character trait that is best suit for them. It is unique for people and important having spirit animal and character traits to help them balance it out and chose what character trait that best represent him or her. Which allow the person to identify what spirit animal is and identify which character trait the animal is. For insist,White tiger know for protect their pup like any mother would do as the same trait as our mom has show.

Choosing character trait could be tricky for everyone but it is important to be wise which character trait is best for you. You can choose which character traits,sometime it can lead to having great friend or loving family. But their will be a price to pay like if you are kind then someone will take avenge of you in order to trick or frame you. My opinion is to be strong and persist or sass but your pick add them long with your chosen character trait. Character traits can be blessing in disguise and curse.

As you see chosing your own character trait is better then someone influences you; it only cause problem and change you then your real self. Although, I explain my reason:everyone has there own unique trait ,animal,lastly the price of choosing character trait. Therfore I always said ""Character trait can be beautiful but a curse in disguise"". Anyway not a problem. That I truly believe that everyone has the right to chose their own character traits then having someone influences them to have the same character trait as them then having your own traits.",0,original_moth,Task: Write an essay exploring the significance of character traits and how choosing the right one can be beneficial.,8
28B00BFB8BD3,"Dear principle,

I am writing this letter to tell you that i am against this new policy of at least having a B average to participate in any kind of sports. the reasons why is because kids need to have their fun. You shouldn't make that policy because you don't know if the kid will change once he is in sports. Sometimes a kid that does a lot of trouble and gets into sports changes because they don't concentrate on doing trouble. I'm going to explain my reason why this policy your doing is a wrong choice.

My first reason was that kids should have fun. Why? because they get tired of school.

Sometimes the teacher get on their nerves so they get into a sport were they can be relax and have fun without teacher making you do a lot of work and having to yell at you for stupid reasons. Sometimes its hard for i kid to do good in school when its boring. They have to be doing an activity and some classes are not like that so they fail it.

Second reason was that you shouldn't make it because after kids go into a sport they start to change. If you don't give them a chance then you will not know if they have a chance to change at all. When i was in a sport my grades started to change i started to come to school every day and i would always say to my self "" i better do good if not my cosh is going to find out and he is going to make me do a lot of running"". That's why you should give them a chance.

Last reason was that kid don't concentrate in doing any trouble when their in any type of sport. All kid concentrate is on doing good in your classes so they cant get in trouble in their sport. If their not in a sport they end up doing bad not caring about school and they just go to school for a waist of time. Instead let them have sport so it can be the other way around.

So principle please let us have sports, don't make the policy its unfair to some kids cuase they have trouble learning. I just want to say that if you read this i hope you change your mind. I really want kids to be able to play sport with low grades      ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
C0B30026B439,"As an eighth-grade student, I know how difficult it can be to make decisions, especially when faced with multiple options or conflicting information. However, being decisive is an important skill to have, as it helps us to take action and make progress towards our goals. In this essay, I will discuss some research methods that can help me become more decisive, as well as some possible solutions that I can practice to improve my decision-making abilities.

One method that I have found helpful is to gather as much information as possible before making a decision. This can involve researching the topic, consulting with experts, and seeking out different perspectives. By doing so, I am able to gain a better understanding of the situation and make a more informed decision. Additionally, I find it helpful to weigh the pros and cons of each option and consider the potential consequences of my decision.

Another method that I have found useful is to set clear goals and priorities. By identifying what is most important to me and what I want to achieve, I am able to focus my efforts and make decisions that align with my values and objectives. This can also help me to avoid getting sidetracked by distractions or conflicting priorities.

In addition to these methods, I have also found that practicing decision-making exercises can be helpful in improving my decision-making skills. For example, I have tried role-playing scenarios, decision-making games, and other exercises that simulate real-world decision-making situations. By practicing these exercises, I am able to develop my critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which can help me to make better decisions in the future.

Finally, I have found that reflecting on my decision-making process can be helpful in identifying areas for improvement. By analyzing my thought process and considering what worked and what didn't, I am able to make adjustments and improve my decision-making abilities over time.

In conclusion, becoming more decisive is an important skill to have, and there are many research methods and practices that can help us to improve our decision-making abilities. By gathering information, setting clear goals and priorities, practicing decision-making exercises, and reflecting on our decision-making process, we can become more confident and effective decision-makers. As an eighth-grade student, I am committed to continuing to practice these methods and improve my decision-making skills,",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,9
3CA61DE9B5C6,"Cell phones today are generally used for many reasons. They may be used for texting, calling, emergencies, and many more reasons. Shocking but true, in this day in time, people need cell phones. Some may be against this matter, but do they know everything besides teens texting everywhere they go? Cell phones are one of the major ways of communicating. Students should be allowed to obtain cell phones during school hours, and also be allowed to use them during free periods.

First and foremost, cell phones are a major way of communicating. Students may need to communicate with parents, siblings, and other students. Calling your parent for a quick minute or two may secure your way of getting home or even to obtain a book you might have left at home for your next class. Also, talking to other classmates throughout your school may give you extra time to study with them or to finish a couple of assignments you were unsure about or needed help on. Communicating with cell phones will provide you extra time to do this by sending a text or giving them a quick call, after all lunch time and free periods don't last forever. This takes less time and gives you extra time for many other priorities you may have.

Also, students need a little free time during the school day. If time is given to them to have their cell phones out and to check what they need to, students may not be prompted to sneak a text in class. Eight out of ten schools who allowed students to have their phone out at a specific time of day saw a decrease in the number of phones out during class time. Giving students this time will show that you trust them to do what they are supposed to in class. Plus, students may realize administrators trust them to keep their phones off and in their pockets during class.

Therefore, providing trust is a key to students. Showing them they have trust may provide the whole school with many other positive characteristics. Students may feel they are being rewarded with a little free time by having their cell phones out. If this opportunity is given 99% of students may do better in school. Many may think this just gives students a way to have their cell phones out without getting in trouble for it. However, students are actually very responsible and may do the right thing.

All in all, changing the cell phone policy will benefit the school in various ways. There needs to be a sense of trust and knowing they have responsibility inside them first. Students aren't always going to do the right thing. However, giving them this time will allow them to escape and talk with friends that they may not see everyday. This new policy will provide everyone with many opportunities that will have a positive effect.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

The peope of American should let their voice be heard. Why should we rely on the electoral college to pick our prisendent? In fact if you're going to rely on the electoral college to pick our next president why let civilized American citizens vote? I would say it is time for a change and let the American people's voice be heard. It seems as if the passage is more in favor of elections based on the electoral college votes. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. At the most basic level,the electoral college is unfair to voters because it's a winners takes all system. The electoral colllege consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect your president.

While it is essential to have goals and aspirations, it is also crucial to consider the potential drawbacks that may arise from making a decision too early in life.

Firstly, committing to a career at a young age can lead to a lack of flexibility and exploration. It can be challenging to make a decision about one's career path without having the necessary knowledge and experience to fully understand the implications of that decision. Additionally, it can be limiting to only consider one career path, as there may be other options that could better suit one's interests and strengths.

Secondly, committing to a career at a young age can put undue pressure on an individual. It can be challenging to live up to one's expectations and feel like a failure if their chosen career does not pan out as they had hoped. Furthermore, it can be stressful to constantly compare oneself to others and feel like they are falling behind in their career.

Lastly, committing to a career at a young age can lead to a lack of personal growth and development. It is essential to have the freedom to explore different areas of interest and develop new skills. By committing to a career too early, individuals may miss out on opportunities for personal growth and development.

In conclusion, committing to a career at a young age can have potential negatives that may affect one's emotional and mental well-being. It is crucial to consider the potential drawbacks of making a decision too early in life and to prioritize personal growth and exploration before making a career choice.

Dear Principal,

I think that community service is good for the students as well as our community. The students should be required to do community service to graduate just not so many hours. I sat this because some of the students also need to do school work, for example some students might need to study for a big test or they might have a lot of homework to do. Some students would love to help but they just might not have enough time in there day. For example lets say that I get home from school at three then I finish my homework at four and finish eating and doing my chores at five thirty then I remember I have a test tomorrow and have to study, I finish studying at six a clock But then I have to take a shower and then walk my dog so I finish at seven and by then it's to dark to do any community service. This is how most kids spend there day at least I do . So you see principal this is why we need to have a limited amount of community service to do. Thank you for reading this letter and I hope you take what I said in consideration.

falcon_180b_v1_599,"The ethical debate around using animals in scientific research has been a contentious issue with valid arguments on both sides. As a student, I am against the use of animals in scientific research. While it is true that animals have been used in research that has led to significant medical advancements, there are ethical concerns that cannot be ignored.

One major issue is the cruelty inflicted on these animals during experimentation. Animals used for scientific research are often subjected to painful tests and procedures, causing immense suffering. For instance, testing cosmetics on rabbits involves rubbing chemicals into their eyes and skin, resulting in severe burns, blindness, and even death, which is cruel and unnecessary.

Moreover, there are viable alternatives available to animal testing, such as in vitro methods, computer modeling, and clinical trials using human volunteers. These alternatives have been proven to be more accurate and reliable, reducing the need for testing on animals. Therefore, it is unethical to continue using animals when there are better alternatives available.

Another reason why I am against the use of animals in scientific research is that it raises moral questions about how we treat other living creatures. Animals deserve respect, kindness, and compassion, just like humans do. They should not be treated merely as tools for our scientific advancements.

Lastly, some research using animals does not necessarily lead to practical applications or benefits for humans, making the animals' suffering pointless. An example of this can be seen in psychological experiments, where animals are put through stressful situations without any clear benefits to human mental health.

In conclusion, while scientific research involving animals may have led to some beneficial advancements, it is unethical and unnecessary. The use of animals in research causes immense suffering and there are viable alternatives available. Moreover, it questions our moral obligation towards how we treat other living creatures. As an ethical and responsible society, we must prioritize the well-being of all living beings, including animals.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"The use of animals in scientific research has been a topic of ethical debate.

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the selection of the President of the United States. While it is understood that there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should be taken into consideration.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As the system currently stands, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the potential for disputed elections is significantly reduced. In contrast, a direct popular vote system would likely result in more disputes over the outcome, as any slight shift in the popular vote could have a significant impact. This stability and certainty are crucial in ensuring that our democratic process is respected and can move forward efficiently.

Furthermore, the Electoral College requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to a broader range of voters. This is important because it ensures that the president represents the entire nation, not just a specific region. It fosters national unity and prevents the marginalization of certain areas or interests. Under a popular vote system, candidates would have less incentive to campaign in regions that they know they cannot win, which could lead to a feeling of disenfranchisement among voters in those areas.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states or toss-up states. These states are typically more representative of the entire nation and are likely to have a more thoughtful and engaged electorate. By prioritizing these states, candidates are forced to listen to and address the concerns of a wider range of voters. This ensures that the election is decided by the most informed and engaged citizens, leading to a more representative outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance the political influence of large and small states. Large states have more electoral votes and therefore receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This is important in offsetting the disproportionate power held by small states due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By giving larger states more weight in the election process, the Electoral College ensures that their voices are heard and their interests are taken into account.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In the event that no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College guarantees a clear winner. This avoids the complications and logistical challenges that come with run-off elections. It also prevents situations where a candidate with a small plurality of the popular vote could win the election, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the presidency.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it is important to remember that the majority of voters in presidential elections are motivated by the desire to express their political preferences. The impact of a single vote in a national election is limited, yet millions of Americans still cast their votes because they believe in the democratic process and want their voice to be heard.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides stability, regional representation, thoughtful decision-making, balance between large and small states, and a clear winner. It may have its flaws, but it is a system that has proven effective in ensuring the fair and representative selection of the President. I urge you to consider these advantages and support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I think you should not make the school policy. Kids would not be playing sports if you do that so the school has no trophies for the school. You should leave the sports and activity's. The students would try harder and maybe even not sleep and the students would fall a sleep in class.

That is why should not make that policy at your school. Also they would not try anything to play sports because if you make that policy kids will not try harder. Teachers would not like there students falling a sleep in class and them getting detention for trying harder. Students would hate the principal if they are not allowed to play sports and other activity's with a grade c average.

Most kids would be tiered of lack of sleep so kids would not be happy about this situation. Policy are not fair because they make follow the policy's that schools make and the government that make new unfair policy's.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a group of people that help countries that have been in World Wars recover food, supplies, animals and more. The other members and I do so many cool things in the program! If you were to join you could do these cool things with us. So you should think about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboy program is an opportunity of a lifetime. While traveling you can see many landmarks or historical sites. Maybe we could see the Great Wall of China sometime! You could meet many new people in the world. Oversea you could learn many new languages like Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and many more.

If your in a Seagoing Cowboys program you could visit many cool places. You could see the Great Wall of China or even The Acropolis in Greece. While being in the program I've been to the Acropolis in Greece and I've ridden in a Gondola in the streets of Venice, Italy. You could visit landmarks and even statues of historical figures.

After delivering the animals and food we clean everything up then we have a bunch of free time. In our free time we play baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to help pass time. We play all these things in the cleaned out stables of the animals. We all have fun! If you were to join us I bet you would have a bunch of fun too.

In conclusion, joining the Seagoing Cowboys is fun, friendly, and fantastic! We help many people but we have fun at the same time. Everyone in the program right now is having fun. I would love to see all of you join the Seagoing Cowboys. Hope to see you sign up soon!         ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
0FE8E2AE214E,"I see why you think that aliens could have formed it. In 1976 it looks like a face and we all were surprised about it, but we needed more evidence. The picture quality was not the best so we went back out there in April 5, 1998 and we snapped another picture of the so called ""face"".

The camera that we used was ten times sharper picture than the first picture that we took. We looked at the picture that we took and there was no alien monument after all, but the picture still wasn't that well of quality. Not everyone was satisfied.

On April 8, 2001,a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, we decided to take another picture but with better quality. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face so we could clearly see it. We captured a photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixle spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo. It was clear that it was just a land form and no signs of alien form.                                                                                          ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
0FE3B7AAD133,"There are millions of schools across America. Many schools offer extracurricular activities after, before, and during school. I believe that extracurricular activities are a great way to become more social and outgoing within your community, but I don't think it should be forced upon either. Yes, you may have those kids who would love to socialize more, but you also need to look at the bigger picture. Millions of children get bullied everyday for anything, clothes, appearance, religion, etc. I have come to terms with the fact that you can't change people, but you can prevent unspeakable situations from happening. I disagree with forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities because they may get over worked, have a higher chance of bullying, and lose personal time.

From a students perspective, another extracurricular activity may be enjoying, others may not agree. As stated, three of these possible activities are student council, sports, and working on the yearbook. The possibility of getting over worked is very high. If a child thought they could be on the student council, but realized it was to much for them, what would happen? Could they just leave the council or would they have to go through with it? What if they didn't say anything at all because they we're too embarrassed? Children already have to go with so much already believe it or not. Kids already have homework, projects, tests, etc. Then to add another chip on their shoulder, kids could become very stressed with their activity.

Bullying has been very big problem these past couple of years. Lots of it has to do with social media. Still, many kids get bullied in school. Based on how they look, how they dress, what they bring to eat, religion, and more. That could happen so much easier when you add another extracurricular activity. For example, lets say a student chose to do sports, and this student wears a hijab as part of her religion. Everyday she's told to take it off or is called slurs by other classmates in her activity class that she has never met before. It's the same people every day, she just shrugs it off. She then finally says something to a teacher. They finally get suspended for how many days, and are kicked out of the sport class. Everything is fine now, right? Wrong, she will always remember what they said to her, and it could've been prevented if they didn't force an extra class.

Many kids have their own out of school activities. A child may get caught up in both of their activities. For example, lets say that a student has to go to school for their activity, but they also have soccer practice. If they go to practice then they miss the in school activity, and if they go to school then they miss their practice. Both are very important to the student, but they need to choose. They shouldn't have to choose, and then be stressed about the other decision.

Adding another extracurricular activity may make a student over worked, have a higher chance of bullying, and lose personal time. I think that if you want to do an extracurricular activity you can, and if you don't want to you dont have to. If you did do another activity what would the end goal be for that. Would it be to make kids social? Would it make kids try and trust each other? Maybe, forcing children to communicate with one another isn't the best choice?              ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

I am well aware about this idea to let kids bring cell phones to school and let them use them in free time, but I believe that kids should not be allowed to use them.

Kids need to be learning, not texting and talking to there friends. They do that enough out side of school. If they can do it any time during school, then they might as well do it the whole day because that's exactly what their going to do.

I believe that they should only be allowed to bring it in case of an emergency. While they are in school it should be turned off and in their locker. Kids spend so much time on the phone that it is becoming a habit. We need to break that habit, not encourage it. Letting them bring phones to school is only going to make it worse.

I hope you consider what i said. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

One advantage of limiting car usage is that it is less stressful and it helps you save money. From source 1, Hedirun Walter said "" When I had a car I was always tense."" In the community you could own a car but you were not allowed to park wherever you wanted. You had to park it in large garages and you have to buy space for $40,000 with a home. So most people didn't have cars but they were saving lots of money. 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there cars to move to the community. Most of the people liked walking around the community or just taking the transportation they gave them. It peaceful and less traffic.

Another advantage is that it reduces pollution and also reduces global warming. From source 2, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" If they did not leave thier cars at home they would have to pay a fine, 22-euro ($31). After they have had the cars off the streets ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the of france, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" The cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer to trap car emissions. They also blamed the diesel fuel...""A tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vechicles in france, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines..""

From source 3, Colombia had a ""car-free day"" where all colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the transportion buses to work. For 3 years they have been doing this being they wanted to reuduce the smog. People who disobeyed had to pay $25 fines. "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""said businessman Carlos Arthuro. Since people have started waliking or riding bicyles, they have improved the city by fixing the uneven sidewalks and making them smooth. Also since there is no traffic, "" new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

In conclusion, there are many advantages limiting car usage. It saves money, helps the enviroment and a human's health. Limiting the car usage teaches the citizens that we also have to car about the enviroment and that is it less dangerous.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
EA857E7CEFD9,"When considering whether to add one and a half more hours to the school day, several important factors must be taken into account. Firstly, providing an extended school day would take away from time students otherwise would spend on after-school activities, such as club meetings or sports practices. For instance, a student who is on the school's football team would have to decide between sacrificing time spent developing their team skills or risk sacrificing their academic pursuits. 

Secondly, this extra hour and a half would also put a strain on our already stretched teachers and staff. As the school day length increases, so do the workloads for teachers, making it harder for them to focus on their students. Additionally, due to the lack of time for other pursuits such as research, the pay might become too poor to attract new teachers and staff.

Finally, this longer school day would leave students tired and unable to learn as effectively as they would when properly rested. During an extended school day, students would be less alert and less likely to absorb what they are taught, reducing the quality of their education. 

These are just a few of the reasons why the school should not add one and a half more hours to the school day. It is important to take student's health, well-being, and education into account when determining what is best for the school. Therefore, I strongly urge the school against extending the school day.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Write an essay arguing against your school adding one and a half more hours.

Okay, so the first reason why people wanna lose weight is because they wanna look better.  Like, let's be real, who doesn't wanna have a six-pack and be super toned?  It's like, the ultimate goal for a lot of people, and I get it. When you look good, you feel good, you know? And if you're carrying around a bunch of extra weight, it can be really hard to feel confident and comfortable in your own skin. So, losing weight can help you feel better about yourself and your appearance.

The second reason is because it can improve your health.  Like, obesity is a serious issue, and it can lead to all sorts of health problems, like diabetes, heart disease, and even some types of cancer.  So, if you can lose weight and get your body back to a healthy weight, it can really help reduce your risk of getting these diseases. And that's not just good for you, it's good for your whole family too. 

And the third reason is because it can increase your energy levels.  Like, when you're carrying around a lot of extra weight, it can be really hard to do stuff, like play sports or run around with your friends.  But, if you lose weight, you'll have way more energy and can do all the things you wanna do without getting tired easily.  It's like, the best feeling in the world! 

So, in conclusion, losing weight is important because it can help you look better, feel better, and have more energy.  It's not always easy, but it's definitely worth it.  And, if more people did it, we could have a healthier society overall. *exc",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

You can't believe anybody that has no real evidence. In paragraph five it says that ""evidence that NASA would rather have."" That shows that NASA doesn't want to say to anybody that is assuming that this is created by aliens because they really want this to be confidential. People thing the face is evidence of life on Mars and the Face is bona fide so they are saying there has to be life on Mars. In reality they don't know what they are saying so they are assuming that this was created by aliens just to start talk and give people something to talk about. This is evidence of why you can't believe anything without true evidence.

NASA won't even leak anything. Some people think that Face is bona fide and that shows there are aliens on Mars. Nobody knows is that is true because if you read the paragraph it says some people think and everyone is believing what people think. THe story has been around for about the Face on Mars and it's bween everywhere for about 25 years and after a while of the story people started to say things that are not real mixed in with real things and people have just been going around like that.

CDF2746198CB,"Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to you on the topic of the two possible policies you are considering regarding students having cell phones in school.

The one that I truly believe would best benefit our school is Policy 2: Not allowing cell phones in school.

This is better than Policy 1 for a number of reasons.

Did you know that 4 out of every 5 eighth graders has a cell phone?

If students were allowed to use their cell phones during free times such a lunch time those without cell phones would feel left out, excluded.

As a middle school we don't want any students feeling hat way for it could lead to stress and more serious matters.

Those that do have cell phones would make fun of these students and these distractions will likely affect all students grades as they would pay even less attention during class.

The question you are forced to ask when you deal with this topic is : What is causing these students to feel obliged to text and use their cell phones during class? Well yes they want to communicate with friends in other class and it's also fun to disobey the rules behind the teachers back.

However, the main reason is due to lack of interest in their academics.

More and more teachers are reverting to teaching methods solely based on note taking and book work.

Not only does this bore students to death but it awakens a rebellious nature within them that causes them to use their cell phones.

The method many students want learn with and will learn by is hands on experiments and class discussions.

This way students will feel more important and unique by being able to participate in class.

They will want to learn more and strive to do their best.

Although Policy 1 is a possible solution to the issue of students using their cell phones and their lack of attention during class it's just not a viable one.

Allowing them to use their cell phones during lunch and free time will have the opposite affect of what is meant of Policy 1.

Although students may continue to feel the urge to use cell phones during class after you enforce policy 2, their view on the matter will change after teaching methods are made better.

Not only will this solve the problem but it will boost student moral and grades.

Thanks for listening to my opinion.

Sincerely,

AC322869C365,"Some students rather attend school from home, but personally, it's notably more beneficial to attend classes from school. It is too big of a responsibility for students to wake up in their very own home and do their work and assignments. Also, It's much more interactive and reliable to be in the school enviornment. It's also much easier to achieve higher grades and expand on learning abilities.

The responsibility of having students wake up early in the morning and learn is enormous. Having to do work from the household is easily distracting to the students. They are surrounded by games, and devices that are not obtainable at school. There is a different mentality of being in a home rather a place built around learning. When at home, students are not used to spending hours upon hours learning and doing their assignments, and when bored or tired have easy access to avoiding their work and abandoning their tasks. Simply going for a drink of water or gaining easy access of electronic use with no monitorization is time subtracted from the required learning.

The enviorment of school is built around thorough plans of keeping students engaged and learning. In school, there is supervision, enforcement by the teachers and administration given to the students to do their work. Not only are students encouraged to do their work in school, but they're given more opportunities to learn their subjects and material. Students having assistance and guidance from their teachers, staff, and peers is beneficial to them because it gives them the chance of asking questions and having one on one help that's not given over a digital screen. This help leads to better grade results and better performance by the student.

There is much more than just learning that students benefit from attending a school rather their home. They're introduced to new people. Students develop social skills and bonds that they don't even know about. . There are many cases of homeschooled students who complain in the future on how awkward they are when they speak to new people, or how they interact with others. Having the chance to socialize with those nearby, speaking with them , and experiencing events with them eliminates this problem and leads to skills and relationships in the future. Attending schools sets up students for the future in not just academic or educational ways.

It's important that students are not secluded from the outside world in the future and have the chance to strive for success. Rather being in the confined, comfort of their own home, students are given more opportunities and a chance at a better life. It's concluded that schools are more beneficial to a students overall success.        ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

C48AEB2F1FC2,"The electoral college is a process established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president & vice president, & the counting of electoral votes by congress. Their are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of impressive democratic origin & history; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. Our country would be much better off if we kept the electoral college, rather than choosing the president just based on the popular vote.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of choosing a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college methodis not democratic in a modern sense, it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate, youre actually voting for a slate of electors.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your states entitled alottment of electors equals the number of its congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of representatives plus 2 for each senator. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected & what their responsibilities are.

The electoral college is good because it resores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in constitution. The elctoral college also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. Votes in the toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing candidates- knowing that they are going to decide the election.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for each party's nominee... however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national populr vote. Yet that has happened in 2000, when gorge had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no intention or hope of carrying their state- democrats in texas, for example, or republicans in california. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign thn they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible american population did vote in 2012's election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think a single vote may decide an entire election.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8

Altheough it is understandable theat candidates go to thee ""swing"" and populous states, theere is no excuse for ignoring theousands of people from thee small states. The president of thee United States is thee president for an entire country, not just a region of it. Voters from thee nonswing states will still want to see thee candidate to decide on who to vote for, even theough theey aren't voting for thee actual candidate. The Electoral collegee is imperfect and undemocratic!

In conclusion, thee Electoral collegee and its electors must be disbanded so theat popular vote will be used in determining thee new president of thee United States. According to bothe Source 2 and 3, thee process of voting a group of people to vote for you is undemocratic. Electors, thee people making up the Electoral collegee, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, nonswing states will be ignored theis will anger and frustrate theem since not one candidate tried to persuade theem.

Have you ever thought of being a scientist at NASA or have you ever seen the Face on Mars? Well I am a scientist and I have been very lucky to go to space and see the Face in person. It was one of the best experiences that has ever happened to me in life! Some people think that the Face was created by aliens even though there has been many tests and agreements that it is just a natural landform. I belive that it is a natural landform beacuse there is proof that scientists have figured it was just another Martian mesa, there are pictures that proves it could just be formed like that because it is common around Cydonia, and there has not yet been any proof to encourage it was created by aliens.

The scientists and I have done several researches ever since we first saw the Face. Everything has yet led to prooving it is just another Martian mesa. Looking through all the pictures, everything stated that it is just a huge rock formation. The rock resembles a human head with eyes, a mouth, and a nose. I believe that after all the temperatures such as the heat and coldness, it could have caused it to be shaped like that. There has probably even been spaceships that has landed in Mars in search of investigation. The spaceships could have formed these shapes when landing there.

As you probably know, it is very common around Cydonia to have these kind of natural landfoms. Yes, it is common to have shapes and forms that are unusual such as the Face. The only difference in this one was that it had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Theres not really much of a difference if you think about it. It is unbelievable that it's the first time poeple think of an alien doing this art work when they have never thought of this idea when we have found other evidence of natural lanforms like the Face.

There has been plenty of evidence to proove that the Face is just a natural landform, but there is no proove of it to be created by aliens. Looking at the pictures closely, there are no footprints, fingerprints, or marks to show any living life in Mars. If theres no living life in Mars, then how could there be aliens? I want you to think about that. There has not been any kind of creatures found in Mars which is shocking.

Now that I have explained myself of why I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, what do you think? Do you still believe aliens created it? If you do, I encourage you to do some research and tell me the reasons of why you think that the Face was created by aliens. After all the research I've done, all my conclusions sum up to the same knowledge through the evidence prooven. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
0e62b8db,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage 

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. As seen in the passages provided, this approach has been successfully implemented in various places around the world, with positive results. By reducing car dependency, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, create more accessible communities, and promote healthier lifestyles.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are responsible for climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can reach up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or public transit, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality. Cars emit pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can have negative health effects on individuals, especially those with respiratory issues. For example, during a smog episode in Paris, a driving ban was enforced and congestion was reduced by 60 percent, leading to improved air quality (Duffer). Similarly, in Vauban, Germany, where car ownership is limited, residents enjoy cleaner air and a quieter environment free from car noise pollution (Rosenthal).

By limiting car usage, we can also create more accessible communities. In many suburbs, cars are the main mode of transportation, leading to sprawl and the need for extensive parking facilities. However, smart planning initiatives, like those seen in Vauban and other places, encourage compact development and prioritize accessibility to public transportation and amenities within walking or biking distance (Rosenthal). This approach not only reduces the reliance on cars but also fosters more vibrant and livable communities where people can easily access the services they need.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier lifestyles. In car-centric societies, people often spend a significant amount of time sitting behind the wheel, leading sedentary lives. By promoting alternatives such as walking or biking, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines, leading to improved health and well-being. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was instituted, leading millions of people to hike, bike, skate, or take public transport instead of driving (Selsky). This event not only reduced congestion but also encouraged physical activity among citizens.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating more accessible communities, and promoting healthier lifestyles. As demonstrated in various examples from around the world, smart planning initiatives and car-free events can lead to positive outcomes for both individuals and the environment. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and reevaluating our dependence on cars, we can work towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1,radek_500,,1

I think that who ever gets the most popular vote shoulkd be president because thats who the people want to president. Whats the point of having the people vote for president when they vote dont even count, its just the waste of their time.

The electoral college is made up of 538 and the majority vote is 270 that means that who gets the majority wins the election no matter what the popular vote saids. which is the winner takes all vote.

5DA51172F93D,"The Facial Action Coding system is valuable in the classroom. This technology can tell how a student is feeling even when they do not say it, which is good becuase some students may feel unfortable telling the teacher or class they do not understand the material. Not only does the system know when a student is confused, it also works on everybody and is very accurate.

First off, this technology can tell weather a student is confused or bored. Many students, including myself, find it difficult to addmit when they do not understand something. If this system was in classrooms teachers would know when students do not understand the lesson. Instead of students being in the dark, and end up failing the test, teahers could pull the students aside and give them extra help.

Not only can this technology tell when a student is confused, it can also tell when they are bored. In the text Dr. Huang says ""Then it could modify the lesson"" which I totally agree with. A student is not going to tell a teacher that they are bored, but with this technology a teacher can still find out. Finding out that a student is bored is great because teachers can modify the lesson to make the students engaged. The students will have more fun being taught with a more engaged lesson, which will raise test scores. Some people may say have this technology in class is werid or creepy, but if they students, teachers, and parents do not have a problem with it there should not be a problem.

Secoundly, the Facial Action Coding System will work on anyone. In the artical it states ""the facial expresions for each emotion are universal"". This means that it does not matter who you are, or what you look like your results will be spot on. Since we all have the same muscles in our face, this technology will work on everybody. Not only that, but this sytstem is accurate. In the text it says ""she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry."" It could have just said she is happy, because it is the highest percent, but this system goes into detail. It also has a psychologist that Dr. Huang relies on to make even more sure the results are accurate.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System should be in classrooms. It can help students get better learning experience, it works on everybody, and it is accurate. ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

Dear Principal [Principal's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the two policies being considered for our school's cell phone policy. After careful consideration, I believe that Policy 1, allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as they are turned off during class time, is the better choice.

Firstly, having access to a cell phone can be incredibly helpful in emergency situations. If a student needs to contact their parents or guardians quickly, having a cell phone readily available could potentially save lives. Additionally, if a student is staying after school for an activity or needs to coordinate transportation, having a cell phone can help them do so with ease.

Secondly, cell phones can serve as an educational tool. Many students use their phones to access educational apps, study materials, and online resources. By allowing students to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times, they can take advantage of these resources and enhance their learning experience.

Finally, banning cell phones altogether may not be feasible in today's world. Many students rely on their phones as a primary means of communication with their families, and it may be difficult to enforce a complete ban.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 is the better choice for our school's cell phone policy. It provides students with the necessary resources to enhance their learning experience while also ensuring their safety in emergencies.

Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter.

Sincerely,

9AFD0FE015E6,"Phones and Driving Essay

There are two items people in the world can't wait to get. A car and a phone. Both are very much needed on today's day and age. A car to get you to where you need to go, and, a phone to contact people. But let me say this, they both DO NOT go well together.

My first reason for why people should not be able to use their phones while they drive is that it is dangerous. You are driving a metal box going 60+ miles down the road. There's nothing to stop you from turning slightly to the right and hitting a two-ton semi-truck or going to the left and coming into oncoming traffic. You need to keep 100% attention to the road just in case some maniac does decide to do that or if someone slams on brakes in front of you. Using your phone while driving takes some of that attention off from the road which is dangerous to yourself and other drivers around you.

Now what are the benefits of texting and driving? Texting someone back? Posting a snapchat on time? The dangers of texting and driving far outweigh the benefits. Now the most leading cause of death for teenage drivers is texting and driving according to www. integrityinsurance. com. That text or that snap can wait till you get home.

My final reason for why you shouldn't text, and drive is that it is illegal. If all the reasons I explained earlier could not get you to stop then maybe this will. If you are seen texting and driving by a police officer, you can get in various amounts of trouble according to which state you are in. In some states it is a fine that ranges from 50-500$. In other states it can result in criminal misdemeanor charges or and evil jail time.

Now that you have heard my reasons for how texting and driving is dangerous and even deadly, you too need to take a stand. Tell a friend or family member that you know texts and drives that they need to stop. Now.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
2158A5D15F84,"On May 24, 2001, about 25 years ago the NASA's viking spacecraft was circling the planet. It then spotted a human like face. It was huge! It was nearly two miles long. It looked like it had been staring back at the camera from where this picture had been taken.

The face is clearly a natural landform. When Mars Global flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin snapped a picture ten times sharper than the first photo. When this picture was taken it was a very cloudy day. This means that the camera had to peer through all the clouds to get this good of a picture. But skeptics say that the aliens images were hidden by the haze. That cannot be true becasue if the aliens were hidden we would not have such a great picture of the faces. That completly shows that there is proof that this face is just a natural landform.

This is a great natural landform and it is very questionable at first, if this could really just be a natural landform. But knowing that the NASA has went out more than one time and taken pictures of this face really does show that it is not aliens. Not only have we taken pictures but we have proof. These are all the reasons why it is certain that this face is a natural landform.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
F0EA44C34C13,"As an 8th grader, I have often wondered whether students should commit to a career at a young age. In my opinion, committing to a career at a young age has both advantages and disadvantages.

One advantage of committing to a career at a young age is that it allows students to gain experience and build their skills in that field. For example, if a student is interested in becoming a doctor, they can start shadowing doctors, volunteering at hospitals, and taking advanced classes in biology and chemistry to prepare themselves for medical school. By doing so, they can gain a head start in their career and have a better chance of being accepted into a top medical program.

Another advantage of committing to a career at a young age is that it can help students identify their passions and interests early on. When students are exposed to different career options, they can explore what they enjoy and what they're good at, which can lead to a more fulfilling and successful career in the long run.

However, there are also some disadvantages to committing to a career at a young age. One of the main disadvantages is that it can limit a student's options. If a student commits to a career path too early, they may miss out on other opportunities that they could have explored if they had taken a more flexible approach. For example, a student who is set on becoming a doctor may not consider other careers in science, such as research or engineering, that they may be interested in and excel in.

Another disadvantage of committing to a career at a young age is that it can create pressure and stress. When students are expected to decide on their future career path at a young age, they may feel like they're under a lot of pressure to make the right choice. This can lead to stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being.

In my opinion, committing to a career at a young age is not always the best approach. While it can provide students with valuable experience and help them identify their passions, it can also limit their options and create pressure and stress. I think it's important for students to take a more flexible approach to their career choices, exploring different options and taking the time to figure out what they truly want to do",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

Many people around the world have believed that the image we released of the huge rock formation, which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth is in fact a face, but they are wrong.

I was one of the men on Michael Malin's Mars Orbiter Camera team and I took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos that were released. The pictures clearly showed that the ""Face on Mars"" was a natural landform and not an alien monument after all.

Some people still believed that there was a Face and the reason that it looked like a natural landform and not a face was because it was winter where the Face was located and it was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face and they thought that the alien markings were hidden in the haze. On April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveryor came close enoough for a second look and this time it was a cloudless summer day.

My team captured an amazing picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters, compared ot 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking picture.

Student will be not worring about attend school on time, if they get sick or have to travel for a emergency happen.

In other way been able to take classes online, give the student a chance of choosing their own schedule for example, some student might to take classes in the moprning, some student might want to take classes afternoon or at night time. Taking classes online give the student a chance of doing classes in the other side of the country or anywhere. Many student are not able to attend school.

Attending online school give the student the advantage of working or doing their own projects at home for example student won't relay on school supplies. Students by taking classes online benefits then, because some student have two jobsor lives to far, and they are to old for attending school.

For the students that have two jobs. They get the chance to use there work break to take some classes, test, or even quizzes. For example in my side of the story if my school would give online i would be able to have to jobs and support my family paying some bills. For other student have the same problem.

88006889B561,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student on the topic of changing one's first impression through cognitive ability:

First impressions are super important! Like, seriously, they can make or break how people see you. And let's be real, who wants to be judged based on one quick glance? 🙅‍♀️ It's like, I get it, people are going to form opinions about me in the first few seconds of meeting me, but can't they just give me a chance? 🤷‍♀️

So, I've been doing some research on how to change my first impression. Like, I know I'm not the most outgoing person in the world, but I want to make sure people see me for who I really am - a cool, fun, and smart person! 😎

One thing I learned is that first impression techniques are super important. Like, have you ever noticed how people tend to mirror the other person's body language? 🤔 It's like, if you're standing up straight and making eye contact, they're more likely to think you're confident and stuff! 💪 And who doesn't want to be seen as confident? 😜

Another thing I found out is that impression management is a real thing. Like, you can actually control how people see you by what you say and do! 🤯 It's like, if you want to be seen as funny, you should tell jokes or make funny faces. And if you want to be seen as smart, you should talk about things you're interested in and actually know about! 📚

But here's the thing, managing your impression is not just about trying to be someone you're not. It's about being authentic and genuine. Like, don't try to be someone you're not, but also don't be afraid to show off your unique personality! 🎉 It's like, be you, but also be you-er! 😜

I strongly disagree with the electoral college for many reasons. For one, if our votes can be over powered by the elctoral college, then why even bother having an election. Also, its all of our election we should all have a say without it being over ruled by a small group of people. And lastly, even if we were to have an electoral college. Mke all votes equal it is extremely unfair to make evry citizens vote equal to one vote and the senators equal to two votes.

First I'm going to talk about why theres no point of even having an election. Well whats the point if almost every U.S citizen takes time out of there day to vote and pay money to do so when at the end when they count these votes there only going to go by what the electoral college says anyways.

Secondly, who even came up with this idea... Having the whole country vote for somone then letting 200 something people determine if there votes are correct. Its an opinion and it should be majority rules.

Its is the dummest thing Ive ever heard and my baby cousin could of set up this system better then you guys.

And lastly, why the senators votes shouldnt count as two. Well unless ther super human or some type of god there just as important as anybody else who voted.

Students should be allowed to have cell phones in school but to turn them off during class time. The policy is a great idea in a plethora of ways. Students stay out of trouble and not have to go through vigorous punishment. Also to have fun and still have the learning skill they need to succeed in life. Policy number one is the best choice for the school.

It is a very reasonable policy because students can have their phones and have their class time as well.

Instead of texting in class they can text in the hallway so it does not disturb the class room environment. That way the teacher's can teach the lesson and respect other students learning. If the policy is not put in place students will text in the class room when they have a slight chance of not getting caught unlike the hallways where there are teachers. The student would not be learning anything because they could not text outside of class. So when the students does get caught the teachers would have to stop the lesson and stop other students learning. Thus, texting outside of class helps students learn more and be more productive during classes.

Some students get in trouble because they have their cell phones. Students could be sent down to the principle's office to call parents about the situation. The problem is taking time out of the principle's plans as well as the students learning. This policy can prevent this situation from happening. If the student does not go down to the principle office their phones would be taken away instead. Making the student rebel and get sent out of class and get set home with out of school suspension for rude behavior. This circumstance can be prevented with the 1st policy. Making this rule will allow them to stay in school learning instead of being in the principle's office.

Without students having their cell phones there will be no learning in the class rooms. Students need time to text, it does not have to be in the class room it can be in the hallway at lunch.

22C47823C6B4,"Dear principal,

I think that you should allow phones at school as long as they are off during class. That way, we wouldn't have to keep our phones in our school bags all day. We would be able to carry them around in school. There could be some pros to this, and some cons to this. Some pros could be this: if something went wrong at school, or someone got hurt, we would be able to call our parents and tell them what happened. Or say we forgot something at home, we would be able to text our parents to ask them if they would be able to bring us what we have forgotten. In that way, cell phones would be a very useful thing to have.

Some cons could be that some students might not listen to these rules and have them on during class. Or besides just having them on, they may text people or play games on their phones. Students could also use cell phones as a way to cheat on tests. They could text each other the answers. Teachers would just have to trust us that we wouldn't cheat on something. Or that we would have our phones off during class time. I guess there really is no way to tell if we have our phones off during class time. If a student is caught doing something with a cell phone during class time, the cell phone should be confiscated until the end of the school day when the student can come and pick up his/her cell phone. If they continue to use their cell phone during class time, they should get a detention for violating school policy, or something along those lines.

llama_70b_v1413,"Introduction:
Hey there! I'm super excited to share my thoughts on the Face on Mars with you. I know some people think it was created by aliens, but let me tell you, it's actually just a natural landform. I've read this really cool article called ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and it's got some awesome information that proves my point.

Body:
First of all, the Face on Mars isn't even a face at all! It's just a bunch of hills and valleys that, when looked at from a certain angle, kinda resemble a face. But that's it! It's not like there's a giant Martian head sitting up there or anything. The article says that the Face is actually a formation called a ""mesa"" which is just a flat-topped hill that's been eroded by wind and water over time. That's why it looks so weird!

Another thing that's really cool is that the Face on Mars changes depending on the lighting. Sometimes it looks super clear and defined, and other times it's all fuzzy and hard to see. That's because the shadows and sunlight can make it look different. It's not like aliens are messing with it or anything, it's just the way the sun and shadows work together.

Oh, and get this - the Face on Mars isn't even unique! There are other places on Mars that have similar formations, like the ""Easter Island"" formation that looks like a bunch of heads. But no one's saying that those are aliens either! It's just a funny coincidence that they look like faces.

Evidence from the article that supports my argument includes the fact that the Face is made up of natural geological formations like mesas and valleys. The article also talks about how the Face changes depending on the lighting, which shows that it's not a static structure that was built by aliens. And, as I mentioned before, there are other formations on Mars that look like faces too, so it's not like the Face on Mars is some kind of special, one-of-a-kind thing.

Conclusion:
So, there you have it! I hope I've convinced you that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform and not some alien creation. It's really cool to think about how the wind and water on Mars can shape the landscape in such a unique way, and it's even cooler to think about all the other natural wonders that are waiting to be discovered on the red planet.

While technology has made our lives easier and more convenient, it has also impacted our relationships and activities negatively. In this essay, I will analyze the positive and negative effects of technology usage on people's lives.

On the positive side, technology has enabled us to connect with people from all over the world. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have made it possible to keep in touch with friends and family members who are far away. We can also use technology to meet new people and form new relationships. For example, online dating apps and websites have made it easier for people to find potential partners.

However, technology has also had negative effects on our relationships. One of the most significant impacts is that it has made us careless about the quality of our relationships. We often spend more time interacting with technology than with real people. We may have thousands of ""friends"" on social media, but we rarely interact with them in person. This lack of face-to-face interaction can lead to a lack of meaningful relationships.

Another negative effect of technology is that it has made us more likely to cheat on our partners. With the rise of online dating and social media, it is easier than ever to meet new people and engage in extramarital affairs. This can lead to the breakdown of relationships and families.

To maintain meaningful relationships while still taking advantage of technological advancements, there are several things we can do. First, we need to be mindful of the time we spend on technology. We should set aside time for face-to-face interactions with our loved ones. This could be as simple as taking a break from our phones and computers to have a conversation with someone in person.

Second, we need to be selective about the relationships we form online. While online dating can be a great way to meet new people, we need to be careful about who we choose to interact with. We should be cautious about sharing personal information online and should never engage in any behavior that could be considered inappropriate or harmful.

Finally, we need to be honest with ourselves about our relationship with technology. We should recognize that technology can be addictive and that it can have negative effects on our relationships. We should strive to use technology in a responsible and balanced way, and",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,5

E45C9BFE63FA," Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This statement highlights the importance of being active and constantly working towards achieving our goals. Jefferson believed that by always being busy, we can accomplish great things in life.

One of the reasons why Jefferson believed in this philosophy was because he himself was a highly productive individual. He was a founding father of the United States, a writer, a scientist, and an inventor. He was always working on something new and never seemed to run out of ideas.

However, Jefferson also recognized that not everyone has the same level of knowledge or expertise as he did. That's why he believed that it's important to find out what others are doing and learn from their experiences. By doing so, we can gain valuable insights and knowledge that can help us achieve our own goals.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson's philosophy of never being idle is a valuable lesson for all of us. By constantly working towards our goals and learning from others, we can accomplish great things in life. Whether we are just starting out or already experienced, there is always something new to learn and discover. So, let's never be idle and always strive to be our best selves.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

06C5AA76CC91,"In the story the author gives us reasonable decisions on why we should go to Venus. It forms like earth and its clled the Earth? twin sister. The author provides a lot of information. One of them states ¨

may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago,Venus was probably covered laregley with oceans and coul have supported various forms of life¨ this cold very well be a lot like earth. There are sea level just like earth and there ¨ familiar features such as valleys ,mountains,and craters.¨These areall the same thing that Earth has,It also says that this Venus could have very well had ocean covering all of it.

The atricle states that they are going on missions and gettin machines to go and figure out why Venus is so much more life-like Earth. The nNAtional Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is trying to do visits with humans to see if they can live there Becuase it states that ¨ iNot easy conditions, but it is survivable for humans¨which very well means that we can live there for a long period of time. They are doing so ich reasearch on this planet becuase they are worried of Earth very well not being here one day.

This could go both wasy this could very well be a successful mission or it could be a very dangerous and unsure mission. That are traking research and countinuing finding more ways to make sure that humans will not have any problems while living in Venus. When they have everything solved they will send humans and see how their bodies will react to the way Venus makes them.

AC06F13B54DD,"The Problem of Distracted Driving

Being on the phone while driving has become a nationwide problem. This problem is due to the increase of the relationship between phone and man. Humans have become more in tuned with their phones rather than paying attention to what is happening in front of them. The cell phone makes the driver lose focus of the road causing many problems. People should not be allowed to use the phone while driving because lives are being loss while people are texting and driving and it is dangerous for everyone on the road. There are two main solutions for preventing using the phone while driving which are either having more police patrol units out to help monitor the roads or having the person set up a self-control system for themselves.

The first prevention method is to have more police patrolling the roads as a way of moderating cell phone usage while people are driving. When people see the police, there is an instant nervous feeling that follows. Instilling fear of tickets or even the idea of going to jail within the people could help control the problem of cell phones and driving. If people see that police are watching, they will instantly do the right thing. Police patrolling can help decrease the numbers of distracted drivers on the road, ensure the safety of the drivers themselves and the people around them.

Setting up units around the road could not only help with distracted driving but also help with situations that put others at risk while being on the road.

These patrol units could be of benefit for numerous problems but distracted driving being the most important. Although it is not an immediate reform to the problem, it is a start for correction.

The final prevention method is to have the people set up self-control systems that not only will ensure the safety of themselves, but the people around them. There are many different systems that can be put in place. One of the first things the driver could do is turn the phone off completely. This will ensure that there is no way the person can use the phone or react to any incoming notifications. If a person is not comfortable with the phone being completely off, then having the phone on silent is the next recommended response to be performed. This can help the driver focus more on the road because the sound of the phone's notifications are not distracting. This is not as effective as turning off the phone because depending on the location of the phone, the driver may be able to see the phone screen light up. If this occurs then the driver can be distracted. The most recommended self-control system is to have the phone completely turned off because it is fully assured that the phone will not be aiding in the problem of distracted driving.

In conclusion, people should not be allowed to use their phones while driving. Driving while distracted is a safety problem that can be corrected. One way of correcting distracted driving with cell phones is to have police units set up on the road watching for any signs of cell phone usage during driving. These police units can ensure the safety of drivers on the road and even pedestrians. There is also the method of drivers setting up their own self-control system. These systems allow for the driver to be responsible for his or her own actions that help with the reforms of distracted driving. The two systems are turning the phone off or having the phone on silent. Turning the phone off is a secure solution for distracted driving because the driver will not have any interaction with the phone. Silencing the phone is the next recommended solution because this allows for the diver to concentrate on the road with a clear mind. These solutions to the problem of distracted driving may not be immediate, but they are a start to helping decrease the dangers that are triggered when distracted driving occurs.

I joined the program for many reasons. I joined because I have a really good friend named Don Reist. He talked to me about how they do things there and how much fun it is. So I thought, if I went and was serving people and helping them survive, would it be good for me, and then I knew that God was calling me to do this and I wanted to do what was right in the eyes of the Lord, so I said, ""Yes.""

Once I got there, I heard that there were 44 nations and that we were going to form UNRRA, wich meant, (the United Nations Relief nd Rehabilation Administration). Don and I had signed up for the ""Seagoing Cowboys,"" where you take care all of the animals. It wasnt what I had expected, but it was still something that I could serve God for.

I had served for many years and I am very happy that I chose to do this. If I haden't then I would be stuck working a bank and grocery store. So that is my story and my many reasons why you should join our group and make the world a better place!

After you have gathered different advice from people you should make a better choice then the one you thought before you asked those people for advice.

Asking advice alone is a good idea but when you ask a bunch of people you also can obtain a lot of knowledge from that individual that could stick with your for a while.

after a bit it gets stuck in your brain and you get to add on to your already known knowledge to make it even greater than what it already was.

You also get more mature and find the better choice of any situation, obviously you won't be perfect but you will be better than before for sure.

It is most likely that you will find more knowledge by people that are older than you and are more wise.

Like your parents you can find advice from both of them, or older siblings. You can go a step further and go find advice from your family, for example your grandparents. the point is the more you ask the better you are off.

For example you are trying to figure out which study method you should use in Spanish to succeed.

You ask your Spanish teacher and she says that you should use her quizlet that she puts up on Google classroom, because it has a lot of materials.

Then you ask your mom for advice and she says she likes it best the old fashioned flashcards.

You take in both of those opinions into account and you decide to do the older way of doing flashcards.

In the example you can see that I got influenced by both sides and got multiple opinions in this situation, which led me to making my decision.

Which was the better choice in the end.

Another example is that you don't know what to write about for your essay in English class.

you ask your teacher and he says that you should do whatever your passionate about or just like in the section of writing prompts.

Your friend tells you to go with the easy way out and get an easy grade on the essay with and easy prompt.

You take your English teacher and friend into account and chose your English teachers way of doing the essay and you get a good grade on the essay.

3d75a33b,"Now a days you see everyone with cars driving to places instead of walking. There are some small towns that cars are not needed because everything is so close but other cities everyone has to drive because everything is very distant from one another. Cars are needed on a daily basis to get to school, or to get to their job but walking or even biking would be a great idea because you would not be poluting the environment there would be less traffic jams and it would reduce the greenhouse gas. Limiting car usage would be a great idea and it would make peoples life a lot better and healthier because instead of driving they would walk to take a bike.

Polution is a big problem especially in big cities because everyone is driving and the smoke the cars leave makes our environment gross. Polution is not only because of the smoke the cars produce, it can also be when someone throws plastic into the oceans and poluting the waters or having trash in parks without recycling. I think we should reenforce the recycling systems because many people dont know the benefits to that and how better our community and even world could be. When your are driving a car and especially in big cities like New York you need a car everywhere or just take the taxi. But just taking the taxi it wont reduce the probablity of polluting the air, it will still have the same effect as if you were driving your own car. If people would just walk or bike to their job or to their school poluting the air would not be a problem just like stated in source 2. In source 2 it talks about how in Paris they would fine the people up to 31 dollars.

There would also be less traffic jams due to the limiting of car usage just like stated in Source 3. In source 3 it talks about how in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that the colombians would ride their bike skate or take the bus and there would be less traffic jams. That is a very good idea because no one likes to be stuck in traffic especially if your in a hurry to get to work or even school. Traffic jams occur because of so many cars on the road. There is a thing called Rush hour and that is when everyone is leaving their work or school and they are going home and that is when everyone is on the road and thats when their is the most traffic. But it would be much easier if you would just bike or walk or take a bus and tried to avoid all of those traffic jams. The program that Bogota, Colombia has created is something that should be done nationwide because it would help so many other countries. Thanks to that programm people would go to the park and do sports and take walks.

Source A talks about the Greenhouse gas and how in Vauban,Germany soccer moms gave up their cars and how the streets were "" Car Free"". That led to having 70 percent of the families in Vauban to not having cars and 57 percent of the people that moved to Vauban to sell their cars. According to this source a person said they are much happier not owning or having a car because when Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother had a car she said she was more tense. Apperently this movement was called "" Smart Planning"".

Limiting car usage would be a great benefit to people and a great idea to improve Earth. Pollution like mentioned before is one of the biggest problems we have and in big cities is an evern bigger problem. Traffic jams is something that will be hard to stop because everyone is using cars and will continue to use cars because it seems like thats the fastest way to get to your location but thats not accurate because if people think that way then thats the cause of traffic jams and thats the cause of the Rush hour. The movement in Vauban, Germany is something that people should do. Im not saying sell your car but to reduce the car usage is something that would be very helpful not only to you, but for the environment.",0,train_essays,,8
90C81189C58D,"Small acts of kindness can make a big impact on someone's life. It can improve their attitude, make their day better, help them become a better person, and help them through hard times. When we show kindness to others, we are not only helping them, but also ourselves.

Firstly, small acts of kindness can improve someone's attitude. When we show kindness to others, we are acknowledging their worth and value. This can help them feel appreciated and loved, which can improve their mood and outlook on life. For example, if someone is feeling down, a small act of kindness such as a compliment or a smile can brighten their day.

Secondly, small acts of kindness can make someone's day better. Even the smallest gesture of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life. For example, if someone is having a bad day at work, a small act of kindness such as bringing them coffee or offering to help them with a task can make their day better.

Thirdly, small acts of kindness can help someone become a better person. When we show kindness to others, we are setting an example for them to follow. This can help them develop a more compassionate and empathetic attitude. For example, if someone witnesses someone being kind to someone else, they may be more likely to show kindness themselves in the future.

Finally, small acts of kindness can help someone going through hard times. When we show kindness to others, we are providing them with a sense of support and comfort. This can be especially helpful for someone going through a difficult time. For example, if someone is grieving the loss of a loved one, a small act of kindness such as a sympathetic ear or a hug can provide them with the emotional support they need.

In conclusion, small acts of kindness can benefit both the person being shown kindness and the person showing kindness. When we show kindness to others, we are acknowledging their worth and value, making their day better, helping them become a better person, and providing them with emotional support. It is important to remember that even the smallest gesture of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,3
E9E6AC0ABFB1,"Although teachers do have the ability to design projects over the summer to prevent a lost of knowledge over the long break however, students should be able to make there own decision on designing there own summer projects. A student-designed summer project can be beneficial in various ways such as allowing students to express there creativity, take matters into there own hands, and to be able to gain new learning experiences. Teachers should encourage this recommendation upon students so they are able to generate there own thoughts and ideas. Therefore, students would not have the mentality of doing work the teachers way, but to acknowledge there own differences among other students. The idea of summer projects is beneficial overall, but giving students the ability to design them will open a new door for learning.

As a student are given a summer project over a long course of time they should be able to design it since it is there own project. There own designs will allow them to generate unique ideas with the spread creativity which enhances there learning abilities. Bill Gates, a famous billionaire known for his worldwide inventions, with his past of dropping out of college and doing what he loved as a full time job allowed him to express his unique ideas while also becoming successful. This may not correlate with student-designed summer projects however, when individuals let there own ideas run free it allows them to experience new thoughts that can be put into use for better accomplishments. Student-designed projects will increase knowledge of students by letting there creativity and ideas run freely.

Students taking matters into their own hand is one step closer to adulthood so why not give students the ability to design a summer project. Giving students authority may be risky, but can be beneficial, so when becoming an adult they will have experience of independence and leadership skills. Marther Luther King Jr, a civil rights activist famous for his ""I have a dream"" speech, took matters into his own hands by protesting for equal rights. However, it led him into trouble with the law, but this activist is well known for his speech which he expressed his own ideas with the ongoing events that made the country realize how it is effecting others. Therefore, students that have authority on certain situations will allow better communication to express there own ideas and thoughts.

It is true when teachers say that some students learn effectively when other students teach them therefore, students that are allowed to express there ideas and share them with other will gain a sense of new understanding of knowledge. Student-designed projects will give them the sense of looking into new findings and understand them. An example would be if a student is stuck during a situation but another student expresses there thoughts, the student that had trouble can learn through others and then come to there own understanding. Acknowledging that others ideas can influence everyone as a whole can provide a well understanding of situations. The benefit of individuals letting there creativity spread allows other to gain new learning experience that have never been thought of before.

In the future, teachers should let more students take an advantage on projects to express there own thoughts with other and spread creativity all around. This act will teach students new learning experiences with also taking matters into there own hands. Everyone learns better when one expresses there thoughts, so why not let student be able to incorporate that into projects.                  ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

4EACC56E424C,"Many people around the world believe in the benefits of distance learning. In fact, various schools throughout the country have began to offer distance learning as an option for their students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Attending classes from home is detrimental to a student's education because of it encourages distractions, limits interactive activities, and prevents social development.

One reason distance learning is detrimental to a student's education is its encouragement of distractions. Often times a student's home is the place where they are most comfortable, but it can also be where they find the most distractions rather it's a sibling, pet, or electronic device. Students struggle to focus and obtain information when they are surrounded by a pool of distractions. Learning in a classroom provides students with a quiet, distraction-free space to learn while also providing them with the tools that they need to be successful. It is also a place where students can learn information through interactive activities.

In addition to a distracting environment, distance learning provides no hands-on activities for students which can be very detrimental to their education. Many students tend to be visual learners and benefit from interactive activities. Past studies have shown that participating in hands-on and interactive activities increases the amount of information that students are able to absorb. When working from home, students are simply working straight from a computer screen without any visual explanation for the information they are learning. This prevents students from getting the hands-on experience that is so beneficial to their educational success. A classroom with an educator allows a student to participate in hands-on activities, receive explanations, and collaborate with others.

Additionally, prevention of social development is another major reason of why distance learning should not be offered to students. When working from home, students often isolate themselves, only communicating with their educator and family. Distance learning prevents the character and social development that would normally be received in a school environment. Coming to school allows people to communicate with peers and teachers while developing a wide variety of social skills. When working with others, students are able to develop communication and leadership skills while learning how to work hard and how to be patient with their fellow peers.

Others might argue that distance learning provides students with a comfortable environment for learning. In reality, one's home is too comfortable of a place to successfully learn. Distance learning can be very detrimental to a student's education because it creates a distracting environment, disallows hands-on learning, and prevents the development of important life skills. In all, this feature of online learning should not be allowed for students because of its detriments to educational success. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
E2A544B069F1,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, the reason why is because this is the closest planet that is somewhat like earth. So we NASA wants to know how relateable we are to Venus.

In paragraph 3 it tells on how dangers Venus is. It says in the article ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. On the planet surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" from those sentences it shows on how dangers Venus is. Also earlier in paragraph 2 it says ""Each previous misson was unmanned and ofr good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landinf for more than a few hours"". thats how dangerous Venus is which is a reason why scientists are scared.

But the prize is worth it if we get the knowledge on how Venus is, in paragraph 8 it says ""Striving to meet the challenge presebted by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be ganied on the planet itself, but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Which means we can go to other planets because we wearn't scared with Venus and we shouldn't have doubt for us humans because we would always find a way to do something. So if we do explore Venus and it goes great we could go to other bigger planets.

In paragraph 4 it says ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may have once been the most earth-like planet in our solar sytem"" which is another reason why scientists want to reserch Venus is because Venus is somehwhat alike our planet the earth. Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life it's just like earth. So they want to explore Venus because it's almost just like earth.

Even though Venus is very dangerous it's worth the trip to explore it, even though its not easy conditions, its survivable for humans so scientists are still going to discuss further visits to Venus the ""Evening Star""    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
A9DA6C8A9555,"Imagination and knowledge are two of the most important aspects of human existence. They are both essential for personal growth, innovation, and progress. While some people argue that knowledge is more important than imagination, I believe that imagination is more important than knowledge. In this essay, I will explain why I agree with Albert Einstein, who famously said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""

Firstly, imagination allows us to see things that are not yet possible. It enables us to envision new ideas, technologies, and solutions to problems that we have not yet encountered. For example, when the Wright brothers first started working on the airplane, they had no prior knowledge of aerodynamics or engineering. However, they used their imagination to create a design that could take flight. Today, the airplane is one of the most important inventions in human history, and it has revolutionized the way we travel and transport goods.

Secondly, imagination allows us to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to problems. When we are faced with a challenge, we often rely on our knowledge to solve it. However, this can limit our thinking and prevent us from coming up with new and creative solutions. For example, when Apple was developing the iPod, they used their imagination to create a device that could store and play music. At the time, there was no prior knowledge of how to create such a device. However, by using their imagination, they were able to create a product that has become one of the most successful in history.

On the other hand, knowledge is essential for understanding the world around us. It allows us to make informed decisions, pursue our passions, and contribute to society. Without knowledge, we would be lost in a sea of ignorance and confusion. For example, when studying biology, we need knowledge of the human body to understand how it works. Without this knowledge, we would not be able to diagnose and treat diseases.

In conclusion, imagination and knowledge are both important for personal growth, innovation, and progress. While knowledge is essential for understanding the world around us, imagination allows us to see things that are not yet possible and think outside the box. Albert Einstein was right when he said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""

In this essay, I will explore the various arguments surrounding extended school hours and consider their potential impact on students and their families.

First, let's look at the number of hours most schools in the U.S. are in session. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average school day in the United States is around 6-7 hours long, with some schools offering longer hours for certain subjects or extracurricular activities. In comparison, schools in other countries vary widely in their hours of operation. For example, in Japan, students attend school from 8:00 am to 3:30 pm, with some schools offering after-school programs until 5:00 pm. In contrast, in many European countries, students attend school from 8:00 am to 3:00 pm, with some schools offering after-school programs until 4:00 pm.

While the length of the school day can vary greatly from country to country, it's important to consider the activities that students typically participate in after school. Many students engage in a variety of extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, and clubs, which can help them develop important skills and interests outside of the classroom. However, if schools were to extend their hours of operation, it could impact these after-school activities. For example, some students may not have the time or energy to participate in extracurricular activities if they are attending school for longer hours.

In addition to after-school activities, extended school hours can also impact student physical and emotional health. Research has shown that students who attend school for longer hours are more likely to experience stress, fatigue, and other negative health effects. This can be especially true for students who are already struggling with mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression. Furthermore, if students are attending school for longer hours, it can also impact their family life, as their parents may have to adjust their work schedules or make other arrangements to accommodate their",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,8
C255CCC30A3E,"Technology has had a profound impact on our lives, both good and bad. On the one hand, technology has enabled us to become more connected than ever before, allowing us to communicate and collaborate with people around the world. This has revolutionized the way businesses work, helped create jobs, and given us access to information at a speed that was previously unimaginable. On the other hand, technology has also created new problems, such as cyberbullying, identity theft, and the spread of misinformation. By allowing us to access too much information too quickly, technology can also lead to feelings of information overload, alienation, and even depression.

In conclusion, while there are many positive impacts of technology on our lives, we must also be aware of its potential pitfalls. To counteract the potential negative impacts of technology, it is important to take steps to ensure that technology is used responsibly and safely. This includes monitoring the way we use technology, as well as implementing safety measures to protect our data and privacy. With these measures in place, the positive impacts of technology can hopefully be maximized while its potential harms are minimized.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Write an essay comparing the positive and negative impacts of technology on our lives.,6
EAF6BCA737BD,"In the article ""The Challenge od Exploring Venus,"" the author states that NASA has a compelling idea to send humans to Venus to study it."" Their solution to surving the harsh environment would be to float above the fray. Avoiding the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of thier way.

In paragraph 6 it states that,"" Researchers cannot take sample of rock,gas or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to uderstand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite therisks."" Meeaning that if they want to be able to study Venus from the ground they would have to build something to allow them to safetly gather samples and information first hand.

In paragraph 7 the author mentions that looking back to world war ll they could use mechanical computers instead of using eletcronic ones. The mechanical computers could be made to widthstand the damage of acid,heat and pressure. To test the mechanical computers they can put it through the series of test that they can create in the test chambers to see if they can widthstand it.

In conclusion if we wanted to get a closer look at Venus then we would have to send scientist to venus in specially made space crafts to be able to widthstand the dangers of the sulfuric acid in it's atmosphere. n",0,persuade_corpus,,7

I hope in couple more weeks or months, people will stop thinking in that nonsense. The Viking 1 caught a rock formation and a shadow covering it up and making it look like it was a face. This is one of the biggest hoaxs of all time, it's in magazines, TV shows, movies, and radio talk shows, I mean some people actually tell campfire stories about this, this is crazy! I would've let it go, but then my best friend calls and says ""Hey guess what, I've found out why the face is there, it's a symbol from the Martians for use to come to their planet!"" I wish I could've reached through the phone so I could slap him silly. He thinks just because I work at NASA, he thinks he can be a smart scientist like me. Finally in 2001 NASA descovered that the Face was actually a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. I was finally glad we could put this behind us so that way the world can't go into chaos over a dome on Mars. Although to be fare at least some people had something to talk about or something to be interested in, because if this didn't happen, who knows what people would've done, I know my friend would've never found out a bunch of facts about Mars, or all those stories from writers, or the directors that made the stories come to big screen, it's amazing to see people actually do something with just a face on Mars.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
FE9C4B960A19,"Having a device that reads the emotions of humans would no doubt be very valuable. The device would cause the teacher to know the emotions of every one of their students and in return, the teacher would be more effective. Due to the new information they have, the teacher could change the style of teaching, change their lesson plans, or ask the students why they are feeling what, based on the emotions of the students.

Students have a way of staring blankly when teachers are talking. While the students are not paying attention to the teacher's lecture, the teacher is worrying about how to get the attention of his or her students. But the teacher has no idea how the students are feeling, and the students end up not learning anything. In this common situation, the teacher would have been greatly helped if they knew the emotions of their students. If the teacher knew the students were tired, he or she could have made them do a brain exercise or a warm-up. The teacher could have used a conversation starter or made the class more interactive to gain the students' attention.

Once one gains the attention of the students, teaching becomes a lot easier. The students start to have more fun, and they learn effectively. Because students are learning more and becoming smarter, more will go to college and succeed in life at a higher rate.

Although the use of the Facial Acyion Coding System for the teacher and the learning of the students, it would be an invasion of privacy. Students might feel weirded out by the fact that the teacher knows every single emotion they have. Also, it turns out that humans tend to be pretty good at reading each others' emotions, so it might not be all that beneficial, depending on the teacher.

The best way to deal with the invasion of privacy factor, would be to receive consent from all of the students and their parents. If this step is passed, the students will receive a better education and overall, be better students.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
5BC582396E5B,"When there is a hard decision to make most people seek advice from others to get there opinion. If I ever am about to make a decision I would want peoples opinion, so I don't make a bad mistake. I think that is important to seek advice from others so you can learn from there mistake, have more ideas, and so you don't feel alone. Most people have already experienced what you have, which is why it is good to listen to them. If you ever have to need advice you should talk to somebody so they can help you get an idea of it.

People often need advice from someone they trust, but most of the time the people they trust have made mistakes too. If you listen to the mistake they have made you can fix it. You can use there advice to stop the things they did wrong. Lots of students need advice on things like which courses they should take for high school and middle school. If they ask and older sibling about which course to take in school they will know which are bad and good. If they know which courses are bad they will be able to not make the mistake their older sibling made. This why we should always at least listen to other people in case we make the same mistake as them.

Seeking for advice can also help list ideas about the advice you need. Most people only ask for advice because they are out of ideas and have no idea what to do. When you ask someone for their opinion on the decision your going to make, they will tell you everything your going to need to know. The person giving advice may have already experienced this situation and can help you make a pros and cons list. If you need advice on how to study for a test someone can help give you ideas on how to do that. Listing out ideas is a very good way to be able to see the good and bad things about the advice you need. Additionally, writing down ideas can also make sure you don't make a bad decision, because you are listing cons about the advice you need.

Many people need advice for a serious reason but feel like they will be alone. If you talk to someone it can really help. One example is, kids might want to talk about advice on how to make friends, but they feel embarrassed to talk about it. Another example is, many kids see this new trend going around school and want to do it too, but they don't want to ask their parents. They should always ask their parents first, so they can make the right decision. The student's parents would lead them into making the right decision and would list cons of that decision too. That is why seeking advice can always help. Even if students feel alone in their decision they should go to a trusted adult and make sure they are doing the right thing.

if people ever wants advice they usually ask someone for opinions on how they look, but they should also be able to ask advice on personal things to. Making big decisions on your on can lead to many bad situations. In conclusion, I think you should really seek advice from others because they can help you learn from their own mistake, list pros and cons, and help you feel like you are making the right decision. Opinions can be mean somtimes, but they will always end up helping you. For any advice you need, you should be comfortable talking about your feelings, so you don't end up making a bad decision. ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

The benefits of becoming a Seagoing Cowboy are visiting exciting places, becoming more aware of people who need help, a young man might not get drafted into the army, and there is ways that the boys find to have fun after the cattle has been unloaded.

Being able to travel all across the world is a benefit of being a Seagoing Cowboy. Many take tours and go sightseeing at each destination they arrive at.

A Seagoing Cowboy will become more aware of the people in need that are around them every single day. Luke Bomberger was a Cowboy and after he was discharged his family hosted a good number of exchage visitors and international students.

Another reason someone might join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that they might not get drafted in the army if they are the correct age of 18. They army would see that they are already helping out in the war. They would be helping in the war by bring cattle to the countries that lost most of their cattle and fields.

After the cattle had been unloaded all of the boy on board the ship would play baseball and volleyball in the hold where the cattle had been. Whittling, reading, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and other games were used to pass the time.

C3429FEF8AEE,"Many argue that longer summer vacations would be beneficial to children and teenagers, as it would provide them with more time to relax and enjoy themselves. This would be especially useful during times of high stress, such as final exams, when students need to find ways to de-stress from their rigorous studies. Additionally, a longer summer vacation could provide more opportunity for learning through activities such as volunteer work, internships, or travel experiences that might not be available during the school year. 

However, opponents of longer summer vacations suggest that additional days away from school could lead to a decline in academic performance. As students would be away from their learning environment for a prolonged period, it could be difficult for them to stay on track with their studies and apply new skills in a timely fashion. Additionally, such a decrease in structure and routine could be damaging to children’s development, and intense summer courses may be the only solution to catch up after a longer absence from the classroom. 

Ultimately, whether a longer or shorter summer vacation is preferable depends on a variety of factors. At the end of the day, students need to find a balance between taking a break to rest and restoring their motivation for learning.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Write an opinion essay discussing the merits of longer summer vacations versus shorter ones.

688B11ADB595,"I argue in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. in source 2 it states ""According to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly after Al gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost in the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" So, when it comes to voting, i can say that i haven't done it; well, not for the presidential elections atleast, but knowing that when i am able to do so, my vote wouldn't really make a difference when it came down to who actually won the election, well, i'd rather just not vote in the first place. This is america; a free country; a place where we have the right to vote, so the fact that our votes dont really have that much influence on who we want to be the leader of our country, defies the whole idea of democracy.

Now, dont get me wrong, i know that the electoral college exists for a reason, according to source 1, it says ""The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a comprimise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Which makes complete sense, and people should know their rights and all of the information about voting. But times have changed and people want to be involved now more then ever so when you give them a paper and tell them to pick who they want as their leader, they want their opinion to matter and to make a difference which i know that in some aspect, it does influence the outcome to a certain degree, but the electors votes still have the power to overthrow the rest of the united states citizens no matter how large the percentage of the popular vote is.

In source 3, its states, ""The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non- democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate electors."" Americas government is still developing in order to fit modern times in many different ways, so the fact that the electoral process is still used today makes it hard for us to grow as a country.

18A9BCAC0886,"Cellphones are a part of everyone's day to day life. We find out information, contact others, even kill time using these tiny little computers. It sometimes seems like we couldn't survive without such an essential device, but in reality it may cause more harm than good especially if used in the wrong situations. The ""National Safety Council"" reports that there are more than 1.6 million crashes every year due to texting and driving. It has become one of the nations highest causes of death. Almost every state in America has banned it and in some eye's it should be enforced more than it is. The use of your cellphone while driving is extremely dangerous and should not be allowed or even accepted in society.

While driving at the speed of 55mph if you close your eyes for even 5 seconds then you've already driven the distance of a football field. Now imagine that every time someone looks down at their phone to read or respond to a text for 5 seconds they have already endangered all the other people that were in that football field's length of road. Although it may seem very minor at first to just look down for a second, it is very dangerous. Even though in some situations it may seem like it's an emergency and you need to reply at that moment, it is always safer to pull over and deal with it then. Risking other people's lives is not something that should be taken lightly.

With how updated and modern our technology is now a day's, there should be absolutely no reason to text and drive. New technologies have given the ability to use your phone hands free and be able to text or call without ever looking away from the road. In Georgia there was a law implemented that requires every driver to have this hands free system set up in their car. This in return has caused many drivers to put the phone away and just use the vocal features. The hands free law has saved many people's lives but there are still many phone users behind the wheel.

To sum this up, texting and driving is very dangerous. Putting others lives at risk or even your own just to send that couple word text is not worth it. There are many ways of avoiding this problem, like simply pulling over, or using bluetooth and letting the information be told over the air. Many people would feel safer on the roads and maybe even take in some of their surroundings and be more alert. If this was taught to young teenagers before they got their driver's license then many of their crashes would have been avoided.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
6D41FAC8F3CF,"As an eighth-grade student, I have noticed that the world is constantly trying to make me someone else. Whether it's through social media, advertising, or even my peers, I feel pressure to conform to certain standards and expectations. However, it is important to be myself and not let the opinions of others dictate who I am.

One example of this is the constant barrage of advertising that we are exposed to on a daily basis. Companies try to convince us that we need their products in order to be happy, successful, or even attractive. However, this is not true. We should not let ourselves be swayed by these false promises, and instead should embrace our true selves.

Another example is the pressure to conform to societal expectations. For example, girls are often expected to be pretty, while boys are expected to be strong and athletic. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem if we do not fit these expectations. However, it is important to remember that our worth is not determined by our appearance or abilities, but by who we are as individuals.

It is also important to assert our emotions and convictions. We should not be afraid to express our feelings and beliefs, even if they are different from those of others. By doing so, we can stand up for what we believe in and inspire others to do the same.

One solution to this issue is to educate ourselves and others about the importance of being true to ourselves. We can teach our peers about the dangers of conformity and the benefits of embracing our individuality. We can also learn more about ourselves and our own values, so that we can better understand what makes us unique.

In conclusion, it is important to be ourselves in a world that is constantly trying to make us something else. We should not let the opinions of others dictate who we are, but instead embrace our true selves. By asserting our emotions and convictions, we can stand up for what we believe in and inspire others to do the same. Through education and self-reflection, we can learn more about ourselves and the importance of being true to who we are.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,2
6ACB38C6577C,"Hey, so for this essay, I had to research successful artists and their experiences with criticism. Like, I know what you're thinking, ""Why do I gotta learn about artists and criticism?"" But trust me, it's actually pretty cool.

So, like, I found out that a lot of successful artists have had to deal with criticism at some point in their careers. Some of them even got super famous because of it! Like, remember that one artist who got all those negative reviews and then like, totally proved everyone wrong with their next project? Yeah, that happened.

Anyway, so I found out that criticism can be super helpful for artists because it forces them to think about their work in a different way. Like, they might realize that they're not as good as they thought they were, or that they need to work on something specific. And that's actually a good thing! It means they're growing and improving, right?

But here's the thing: criticism isn't just for artists. It's for everyone! I mean, think about it. When you're in school, you get feedback on your work all the time. Maybe it's a test grade, or a report card comment, or even just a teacher's feedback on a project. And you know what? That's actually a good thing! It helps you figure out what you're doing well, and what you need to work on.

And here's the coolest part: when you get criticism, it doesn't have to be a bad thing! Like, if someone gives you feedback on your art project and says, ""Hey, this is really cool, but maybe try using more colors,"" that's not a criticism, that's actually helpful! It's like, they're giving you a suggestion, not insulting you.

So yeah, criticism might seem scary at first, but it's actually super important. It helps you grow and learn, and it's not just for artists! Everyone can benefit from a little bit of criticism now and then. And who knows, maybe one day you'll be a famous artist and someone will give you a bad review. But hey, at least you'll know how to handle it!",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

9938EA5EE964,"Everyone assumes that the best way of transportation is by a car. Teenagers dream of getting their license on their sixteenth birthday and maybe even getting a car. Most adults use cars to get to and from work, drive their kids around and do fun activites. But what people don't understand is that there are so many other alternatives that ultimately result in a happier and healthier planet. There are so many downfalls with driving and owning a car that many are now believeing that it is much more reasonable to just not own a car.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal, line 6). Having cars stress people out and people don't even realize this. There are so many responsiblities that come with driving. No one enjoys sitting in long traffic jams. It is annoying and quite bothersome. Everyone gets so frustrated, nevermind the amounts of accidents that lead to injury and death from it all.

In Colombia there is a day once a year in which cars can not go on the road or they are served with a fine. This effort is to try to bring stress levels down and stop air pollution. ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily and devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky, line 23). This idea promoted excersize and got people out and doing things in the community. The citizens clearly were not against this day or else they wouldn't have been acticve. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city"" (Selsky, line 28). This just goes to show what driving does. It isolates people. Without all the cars, one is more willing to spend time outside and interacting with other people and since people were out and about more and enjoying the community, the area has gotten more presentable and pleasureable to be in. ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Selsky, line 29). Officals and shop owners are making more of an effort because everyone is more active and caring.

In Paris, the officals made an effort to try and clean up the cities pollution rates. They assigned a day where even number licensed plates could not be on the road and a day for odd numbered plate cannot be on the road or else they will be fined. ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" (Duffer, 14). If anything, it goes to show that the amount of cars on the road is absurb. 60 percent is more than half, that's a lot of traffic. Paris primarily uses diesel, causeing a lot more pollution in this busy city. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"" (Duffer, line 17). Paris is a very touristy area and people go in hopes to see a beautiful city. This project went so well that officals planned to continue it. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" (Duffer, line 19). If officals planned to continue this idea, than it must be benifical in some way. If citizens just made an effort to not drive everywhere, than restrictions would not have to be mad. It's because of the amount of driving that is going on that officals have to get involved.

""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" (Rosenthal, line 37) Motor vehicals cause so much danger to Earth. The amount of pollution is so high and dengerous. It is much easier to prevent than everyone believes. One could simply take the bus, ride a bike, only drive to work and needed places, walk, and even car pool. There are an abundant amount of ways to prevent so much pollution and stress. It's all over the world that this is an issue; Paris, Colombia, the United States, and many other places. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. "" (Rosenthal, line 11). That is a lot. It isn't difficult to help prevent this.

In the long run, not driving would result in happier people anyways. Cars are so expensive that is would cause less aggravation and economic stress as well as the basic stress of just driving and being in traffic. Society could make the world so much cleaner and safer for the next generations. It starts now. Get a bike or a pair of walking shoes and start getting active in the community. Start making the changes now so it isn't forced by officals later. make the effort and show the next generations how life should be. This could lead to a much happier and healthier life style.

D9B44BD44222," To be true to myself in this world, I do not necessarily need the people around me. I can continue with life on my own terms. All the achievements I have accomplished are a result of my own effort and determination, without the help of those around me.

In this world that I inhabit, I cannot trust anyone because instead of wishing me well, they wish me harm. People sometimes act negatively because they are influenced by external factors, such as societal pressure or personal experiences. School may not always help me become someone in life, but it provides me with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed.

To achieve success, I do not need the approval or support of those around me. An example of this is when I had a friend named Generic\_Name, who was once a positive influence in my life. However, as time went on, she began to change and encouraged me to skip school with her. She had a history of misconduct with her parents and continued to engage in negative behavior. I eventually stopped talking to her because her actions were no longer aligned with my values.

To be successful in this world, I must work hard and persevere, even in the face of adversity. Yesterday, I took a test with my classmates in math class, and one of them asked me for help. While I wanted to assist him, I knew that the teacher would be upset if I did so. After the test, he approached me and began to complain. I told him that he should have studied more and that people would not always be there to help him.

Another reason for success in this world is to never give up, even when others tell you that you cannot achieve your goals. For example, I am graduating this year, and my cousin has told me that I will not graduate because I am not very smart. While her words may be discouraging, I know that I am doing my best to graduate, and that is all that matters. Sometimes, I want to cry because of her negativity, but I remind myself that I do not need anyone else's approval to be successful.

In conclusion, I believe that being true to myself and achieving success in this world does not require the approval or support of those around me. While people may have their own agendas and motivations, it is ultimately up to me to make the most of my own abilities and pursue my goals",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

Some people don't understand why it isn't okay to litter. I think i would be a great idea to litter. I think this because students can learn not to litter and help out are environment too. this is good for everybody it shows we have the entiative to help out making earth a cleaner safer place for everyone. But community serves id not just for cleaning up the earth its for also helping people who need us. For example like an elderly home or reading to the blind. There's just so many ways we can help people we just need a little push.

Kids are age don't care if they litter or not but i bet they would if they new how it affected are environment. Litter can hurt living things because they think its okay for them to use but its not some animals try to eat that stuff or build a nest out of it. This could be dangerous for them. Also most of the trash ends up it streams, lakes, or ponds. Soon there's no water left for the animals or the plants and they so start to die.

When we help someone out it might make us feel better and more alert of out surroundings. And plus your making someone's day. When we help out other people it shows that we have good leadership skills. When you take time out of your day to help someone or something your making an effort to help make somebody a little bit stronger.

Our school should promote community serves to promote that we actually care. And to show that if we can to do it you can do it too.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
DA9250021F33,"Dear Principal,

I think that policy number one should be the policy for out school. If you do not allow students at school to have their cell phones that probably wouldn't be that good for the teachers and the students. Lets say that you have an emergency at school and the kid doesn't have his cell phone to call his mom or dad. He would be in a bad situation and the no cell phone policy would come back to haunt you. I think that policy one is great. If teachers catch the students using their cell phone then their should be a punishment after a certain amount of times being caught. I think that it would be fair if they could use them during lunch periods and stuff like that. If they are turned off during class, they shouldn't be a distraction to their learning.

I am not saying that policy two is not a good idea but students wouldn't be themselves if they didn't have their cell phones. Their could be some good things that come out of not having cell phones at all. If you didn't have cell phones at all during school then the teachers wouldn't have to worry about kids texting and could focus on teaching the class. Also, you might see some grades improve if you take away cell phones. Now their are probably some negative things about kids not having cell phones. If a kid has an after school activity and he doesn't have anything to contact his parents then you might have a problem. Some students might argue that if they can not have cell phones them teachers wouldn't be aloud to either.

I think that policy one would be the way to go if I was you Principal. With that students would be able to contact their parents if they had an after school activity. Maybe something bad happened to one of their family members and they wanted to be notified, with their cell phone they would be.

The auto industry is big because of these factors. Though studies show that cars, may not be the best option for the environment and therefore, ourselves.

There is a city in Germany, Vauban. This city is almost completely devoid of cars. How do they do it? Well most of them ride bikes, or simply walk. If there is a distance to far for biking or walking, there is also a tram that runs through the city. The people who live in this city seem to be incredibly happy ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now"" Source 1 says Heidrum Walter, citizen of Vauban. This trend of separation from automobiles is happening not only in europe, but everywhere in the world. The EPA is advocating ""car reduced communities"" in the United States. The world is changing ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" Source 1 The benefit of going carfree, goes beyond making people happier, it might even save the human race. Global warming is a major problem. Though an even bigger problem, is that most people in the US do not believe that global warming even exists. One way that scientists know that global warming is happening, is by looking in the ice of the artic. By drilling deep holes in the artic, scientists can extract tubes of ice millions of years old. Just how you can tell how old a tree is by counting its rings, you can tell how old ice is by doing the same thing. When scientists tested the amount of Co2 in a sample of ice that was formed 50 years after the industrial revolution, then compared it to the level of Co2 in a tube of ice 50 years before the industrial revolution. They saw a remarkable increase in Co2 levels after the industrial revolution. Many people do not know, but mercury looked a lot like earth a billion or so years ago. Now mercury is a desolated wasteland, thanks to the amount of volcanos spewing Co2 into the atmosphere. A similar phenomena is happening all over the world in places like Paris and China. Paris' pollution was so bad, that they had to ban driving for a couple days ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine"" Source 2 In Bagota, Columbia, people take part in a carfree day in order to reduce smog. ""Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday"" Source 3 This is another example of people taking the initiative to give up cars, even if its only for one day.

People are finally staring to realize that cars cause pollution to the Earth. Even the president is backing the cause, which honestly might be why more people have not accepted global warming as a fact. The level of driving has decreased over the years ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995"" Source 4 It is fantastic to know that people are finally embracing science as something to learn from, and not something to fear. What we all need to realize is that, our planet will live on millions of years after we are gone. We are not saving our planet by preventing global warming, we are saving ourselves.",0,train_essays,,6
E6DDB05EB921,"Did you know that the human touch is very important to the human brain? Human touch lets the brain know that you're still alive and breathing. It will let the brain know that their body will always be okay and that they are in safe hands. Without human touch, you or anyone else, could die. Students may experience enormous mental health problems but they should at least try to participate because students will become healthier through human interactions and they can use these activities for future references.

Any student can become healthier through small activities, here's why. These kids will become more social with eachother and they may end up making friends. Even if this activity requires the tiniest conversation, the brain is becoming more active and is not being isolated in it's own thoughts. Students will come in contact with sports through this process. Sports would be a great way to become healthy. A body requires physical exersize, this will help with the vitamins that your body needs throughout the years. Students will be able to think in a more imaginative way. This opens another part of your brain which may have never been used before. This will help you imagine fun things for a ""get away"" space! Any extracurricular activity can helps your students in a healthy way.

These kids will have rough times throughout their lifetime. These activities will help them through their scenario today! Students will have more experience if a future problem gets in their way. The, now grown up, student can reference their past extracurricular activity. They will be able to think more clearly and will be able to get passed their real life problem. Students can use certain extracurricular activities for community service projects. In their future, community service will be very important to college applications. They can use these hours as an example for this future application. Students can think back to their activity and think about the good times that they might have had there. This will make them smile at the eperience they had in high school. It will leave a perminant smile on their face whenever they think of their school. Everyone will have fun yet different scenarios they can look back on and use for future references.

Some kids might have a spiraling and out of control mental health situation. If that is a big problem, then they should not have to do the extracurricular activity. Anything having to do with mental to physical pain should be taken seriously at all times. The smallest thing may be able to tigger this emotion. If this student wants to do an activity, you should let them! Anyone with mental health and physical pain issues can try new things which includes after school activities, just take things a bit slow and see how it goes!

Students may experience mental health issues but you should at least let them try to participate because, these students will become healthier and they will have this for future references! Even though kids may have these issues, that doesn't mean they can't try. Anything can be healthy in it's own way, shape, and form! I think that you should make the kids at least have one after school activity but only to an extent.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
D9B44BD44222,"In today's world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find people who truly care about us and our well-being. It is easy to become caught up in the pressures of society and the need to fit in, but ultimately, standing alone in this world can be a better option.

One example of this is when I had to stand up for myself despite criticism from a friend who had a history of making negative choices. At first, I was hesitant to distance myself from this person, as they had been a part of my life for a long time. However, as time went on, I realized that their influence was only bringing me down and was not aligning with my values and goals. I had to make the difficult decision to cut ties with them, even though it was a painful process. In the end, standing up for myself and my beliefs was the best decision I could have made, as it allowed me to focus on my own growth and development without being held back by a toxic friendship.

Another aspect of standing alone in this world is the idea that people may not necessarily have our best interests at heart. It is easy to trust those around us and rely on their guidance, but ultimately, we must be the ones to make our own decisions and take responsibility for our own lives. This is especially true in the business world, where people may be more interested in their own success than in helping us achieve ours. As an entrepreneur, I have learned that I must be willing to take risks and make difficult decisions, even if it means going against the advice of others.

Overall, standing alone in this world can be a challenging but rewarding experience. By taking a stand for ourselves and our beliefs, we can avoid negative influences and focus on our own growth and development. While it may be difficult to go against the norm and stand up for ourselves, it is ultimately worth it in order to achieve our goals and live a fulfilling life.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,3
85F4C57672EA," In today's world, technology has revolutionized the way we learn and interact with each other. One of the most popular trends in education is distance learning, which allows students to attend classes remotely through online or video conferencing. While some students may benefit from this option, I believe that attending classes from home has its drawbacks. In this essay, I will argue that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, and that the distractions and lack of energy and concentration that come with studying from home are too great to overcome.

One of the biggest disadvantages of studying from home is the potential for distractions. When you are in a classroom, you are surrounded by other students who are also focused on the material at hand. However, when you are studying from home, it can be easy to get distracted by other activities. For example, you might start watching a movie or playing a video game instead of doing your homework. This can lead to a reduction in your grade, as you will not have completed the necessary work on time.

Another issue with studying from home is the lack of energy and concentration that comes with it. When you are in a classroom, you are exposed to a variety of stimuli, such as the energy of your classmates, the enthusiasm of your teacher, and the excitement of the material you are learning. However, when you are studying from home, you are often surrounded by a more quiet and sedentary environment. This can make it difficult to maintain the same level of energy and concentration that you would in a classroom.

In addition to these issues, there are also practical concerns with studying from home. For example, unexpected events can occur that can affect your ability to complete your work. For example, a family member might die, have a car accident, or have a work schedule that conflicts with your study schedule. These unexpected events can take away your time and energy, making it difficult to stay on track with your studies.

Despite these challenges, some students may argue that they can benefit from being able to attend classes from home. For example, they may be able to study at a more convenient time, or they may be able to study in a location that is more comfortable for them. However, I believe that the benefits of attending classes in person far outweigh the benefits of studying from home.

In conclusion, while distance learning may be a",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

EE392BB6CFD1,"Hey, so like, I know it's pretty much impossible to escape the constant pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations, but I think it's super important that people are allowed to be themselves and live how they want to, no matter what. I mean, have you seen the latest meme trends? Everyone's supposed to be laughing at the same things and dressing in the same style, and if you don't fit in, you're basically a social outcast. It's like, come on, can't we just be ourselves and not have to worry about what other people think?

I know, I know, some people might be like, ""But what about when people's choices are harmful or hurtful to others?"" And yeah, that's definitely a thing, and we should definitely be mindful of how our actions affect others. But at the same time, I think it's important to recognize that everyone has their own unique perspective and experiences, and that we can't possibly understand or relate to everyone else's. So instead of trying to change each other, let's just accept each other for who we are and live our lives how we want to.

Like, I'm a pretty creative person, and I love expressing myself through art and music. But I know some people might be like, ""That's not cool or popular,"" and try to discourage me from doing it. But you know what? I'm going to keep doing it anyway, because it makes me happy and brings me joy. And if other people don't get it, that's okay. They don't have to understand or appreciate it, but they shouldn't try to take that away from me either.

And the same thing goes for like, sexuality and gender identity. I think it's totally cool that some people are into the whole gender binary thing, but for me, I don't feel like I fit into either category. And you know what? That's okay. I don't need to change who I am to make other people comfortable or happy. I'm just going to be myself and live my life how I want to, no matter what.

So yeah, I think it's important that people are allowed to express themselves and live how they want to",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay explaining why people should be allowed to express themselves and live how they want to in spite of a world that constantly tries to change them.,0
184218DDCD92,"You make choices everyday, and there is a lot that goes into it. Everybody always wants to do the popular thing, so they get multiple opinions. Multiple viewpoints, advice and the aftermath are all things that people take into account before making a choice.

Many people often seek multiple viewpoints. Lots of people ask their family for opinions. Lets say I'm at Target with my mom and I see a pair of boots I think are really pretty, I'm going to ask my mom if I should get them or not before I spend money on them. Friends, just like family are credible resources. If they are a good friend, they will tell you the honest truth no matter what. Many people want multiple viewpoints. Even if it's just buying a pair of boots from Target, one wants to make sure they are pleasing everyone. Everybody has a different opinion and they should all be respected even if you don't agree with it.

No two opinions are the same. Nobody wants to do the unpopular thing. From my experience all anyone wants to be is popular. Lots of people have different advice. You might ask Generic_Name if she likes your shoes and she says yes because they are unique and then you ask Generic_Name and she says no because they are to plain. Everyone has a different opinion and thats okay, they are entitled to it. However, that can make it harder when trying to make a decision. Nobody's thought process is the same as the person sitting next to them.

The after math of a choice is also important. Social media has a huge role in decision making. For example, if Taylor Swift is wearing a watch everyone is going to decide to go out and buy that cool watch. Everybody wants to maintain a good reputation. Not a lot of people, at least a far as I know, want to be known as the ""weirdo"". Just as many people that want a good reputation want attention. There is good and bad attention. It's all about finding the balance of the both of them. There is a lot that goes into a choice.

Multiple opinions are nessesary to make a good decision. More then one viewpoint can be crucial to making a good choice, no two people have the same opinion and that after math is also important are all things to keep in mind when inquiring advice. Choices take more then just your opinion.            ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
A1C1C0FE3C7A,"Family and education are two of the most important factors that can impact an individual's life. Both of these factors can lead to success, but they can also have a significant impact on an individual's personal and professional development.

Family plays a critical role in shaping an individual's values, beliefs, and behavior. A supportive and loving family can provide a stable foundation for an individual to build their life upon. They can offer guidance, advice, and emotional support when needed. Additionally, a family can provide a sense of belonging and identity, which can be especially important for young people who are still figuring out who they are and where they fit in the world.

Education, on the other hand, provides individuals with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life. A good education can lead to better job opportunities, higher salaries, and a greater sense of fulfillment. Additionally, education can help individuals develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are essential for success in any field.

Both family and education can contribute to an individual's success in different ways. For example, a supportive family can provide the emotional support and encouragement an individual needs to pursue their dreams, while a good education can provide the knowledge and skills they need to achieve those dreams.

However, it's important to note that family and education are not the only factors that can impact an individual's success. Other factors, such as personal motivation, hard work, and perseverance, are also important. Additionally, there are many successful individuals who come from less privileged backgrounds or who have faced significant challenges in their lives.

In conclusion, family and education are two of the most important factors that can impact an individual's life. Both of these factors can lead to success, but they can also have a significant impact on an individual's personal and professional development. Ultimately, success is a result of a combination of factors, including family, education, personal motivation, hard work, and perseverance.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,4
llama_70b_v1909,"Climate change has become a pressing issue that cannot be ignored any longer. The question of whether governments should take immediate action to address it is a topic of much debate. In my opinion, governments should take immediate action to address climate change.

Firstly, the effects of climate change are already being felt. Rising temperatures are causing extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfalls. The melting of polar ice caps is leading to sea level rise, which threatens coastal communities and ecosystems. The frequency and severity of these events will only increase if we fail to act now. For example, the recent wildfires in Australia are a direct result of climate change, and they have caused immense destruction and loss of life. Immediate action is necessary to prevent such disasters from happening in the future.

Secondly, climate change is a global problem that requires a global response. No single country can solve this problem on its own. Governments must work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. The Paris Agreement, signed by almost 200 countries, is a step in the right direction. However, more needs to be done to ensure that the agreement's goals are met. Governments must implement policies that promote sustainable practices and reduce carbon emissions. For instance, increasing taxes on fossil fuels, investing in renewable energy, and promoting electric vehicles can all help reduce emissions.

Thirdly, the economic benefits of addressing climate change far outweigh the costs. The transition to renewable energy sources will create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth. In fact, a study by the International Renewable Energy Agency found that the renewable energy sector could support up to 46 million jobs by 2050. Additionally, investing in sustainable infrastructure and technologies can reduce energy costs in the long run. For example, installing solar panels on homes and businesses can reduce energy bills and provide a reliable source of clean energy.

Finally, climate change is a moral imperative. We have a responsibility to protect the planet for future generations. Climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable communities, including low-income families, indigenous populations, and small island nations. We cannot ignore their plight and must take action to mitigate the effects of climate change.

In conclusion, immediate action to address climate change is necessary. The effects of climate change are already being felt, and it is a global problem that requires a global response. The economic benefits of addressing climate change far outweigh the costs, and it is our moral imperative to protect the planet for future generations. Governments must take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and promote sustainable practices. We cannot afford to delay any longer.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The issue of climate change has become increasingly important in recent years.

159B993974F6,"Over the summer homework is not the best, hence, why teachers do not give it to students very often. giving homework over summer is not really good but what if it was student designed or student designed. There is an ongoing debate on whether summer projects should be student or teacher-designed and the benefits of each. Teachers being the ones to design the project can lead to: students having clear standards of what needs to be done, more time managed project, and being stressed out. Some may that student design is better due to boosting tier moral and letting the project being something they can enjoy. Although some may disagree having a teacher designed project over school is more efficient and safe.

Teacher design based projects will be a lot safer for the most part; Moreover, leaving less room for students to say something like not understanding,not enough time, and being stressed out. first thing is not knowing the standards of the project or understanding them. This could lead to a lot of hiccups if this was a student designed project; Consequently stressing the students out. Time management is also crucial due even if a student has an entire summer. letting teachers plan the time it would best to gradually get it done would be great expecting it not to being able to be finish the day before its due. Some students might put it off until they cant any more probably messing up their sleep schedule trying to rush to finish the project Being stressed out is not a great feeling and can ultimately be a reason some students may just give up. Even if it is all planned out a multitude of factors kick in to be able to stress a student.

There are further reasons to letting the project be designed by the teacher. This can help grades if the project is done, can later reward the students by the teacher having faith in the students to do a multitude of other things. These rewards can help students want to finish projects and have a reason to be doing projects on time. Letting a student design his or her own project is a privilege and will ultimately be earned and boosting confidence getting closer to a student designed summer project. One problem for lots of students is that during the summer a lot of things are forgotten. I think having a project made by a teacher can help challenge the brain and keep it ready for when school is about to began. Doing that can improve performance in school on a daily basis.

Although some may disagree, the projects given over summer should be teacher-designed to limit problems.

The summer projects should be teacher designed due to the benefits given to students like limiting time management problems, helping students be ready for the upcoming your and what to look out for. some state that student designed projects wold be better due to less of a workload and boosting moral but this is not the case. Getting teacher designed projects is a great benefit and less of a work load in the future and can set an example for students wanting to earn being able to have a student designed project.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
F2C012ECBF9C,"First impressions are powerful and often rooted in lasting impressions. It's no secret that a strong first impression can prove to be a decisive factor in a relationship or an endeavor. But can the power of an initial encounter always be convincing? While we all strive to make a good first impression, the reality is that first impressions are almost impossible to change. 

The yearlong study on first impressions concluded that our instincts are surprisingly accurate when it comes to forming an impression of someone. From a brief conversation or an introduction, it takes only a few seconds for the brain to form a judgement. In many cases, this judgement is so strong that it can be difficult to shake off, no matter what the person does to prove otherwise. 

Moreover, first impressions are heavily influenced by a person's emotions. If we meet someone in an unfavorable situation, like fear or stress, our impression of them will be affected. In a lot of cases, people are judged in the context of a problem, and it takes more effort to be seen in a positive light again. 

In the end, it is clear that first impressions are usually hard to shake off.

B731B6D15B45,"Have you ever needed advise on something, how many people would you ask for help? While some people use one person to get advise others use more than one and maybe even up to four people. The viewpoints vary drastically with how many people you use to get help or advise, and that is why people either fail or succeed in important situations. When in important situations people have were there is not any room to fail you should go to multiple people for guidance. The first reason for that is that it will help to get different opinions on the topic you need help with. Second, often times the decision is hard to make on your own and other people could have knowledge of what your decision should end up being. Finally, the more people you ask the more your answer will be refined, for instance you could get a good answer from someone but another person could have pretty much the same answer but they refine it more to give you an even better outcome than you could've had without the other people.

You can get advise from more people to even out the opinions, and the more of those opinions you have the better your advise will be. From my experience people have very varied opinions on different topics, so if you have just one person the likelihood of you having a very one sided piece of advise is much greater than you asking more than just one person. Sorry to say but there are a lot of people with very one sided advise so you need to watch who you ask about advise, especially the important advise. This is why you should never just rely on yourself to make the important and hard decisions to make, you yourself can be very one sided and not even know it. There are many people in the world to ask, and everyone has a slightly different understanding of how things work and how they view everything on whole, so try your best to ask the most people you see to be a good amount to help your upcoming decisions.

You could have a very hard decision in your opinion, but after asking people you could find someone that knows exactly what you are doing and can give you the perfect answer. This is another reason why you should ask as many people as you can before coming to your final decision. For instance you could be working on some specific project that in your opinion is very challenging, but after you've been asking around for help enough you find someone who is very experienced in that line of work. You may not always find these people but asking enough people you will begin to find pieces of your answer, and if you get enough of those pieces you will finally get a good answer for your project. There was a time that I had a project in a class and it was very challenging to me so I went to my mom and dad first and they were very experienced in that background so they gave me a clear and easy answer to help me with that project. That is just one example of how asking more people can help you get better advise overall.

You could get what you think to be a great answer from someone, but you wisely decide to keep asking and find an even better and more refined answer for your decision. This is why you should keep asking people even if you think you have the best answer you should always keep asking until you are sure you have found the perfect answer. It's like making a puzzle, you keep getting getting little pieces of the puzzle and finally you complete it after you are done asking enough people. It is the best way to go about things and there is really no shortcuts, so try your best to get all the info you need to make the perfect decision.

When in important situations people have were there is not any room to fail you should go to multiple people for guidance. The first reason for that is that it will help to get different opinions on the topic you need help with. Second, often times the decision is hard to make on your own and other people could have knowledge of what your decision should end up being. Finally, the more people you ask the more your answer will be refined, for instance you could get a good answer from someone but another person could have pretty much the same answer but they refine it more to give you an even better outcome than you could've had without the other people.

AC7AB280A93C,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that students should have the option to attend school from home. While attending school in person has its benefits, there are also many advantages to being home schooled. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of students being able to attend school from home, including how it affects attendance, responsibility, and job preparation.

One of the main benefits of attending school from home is that it allows students to have more flexibility in their schedules. This is particularly beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as sports or extracurricular activities. For example, if a student is a talented athlete, they may be able to attend school from home and still have ample time to practice and compete in their sport. This flexibility can also be beneficial for students who have family obligations, such as caring for younger siblings.

Another benefit of attending school from home is that it can foster a greater sense of responsibility in students. When students are responsible for their own education, they must take a more active role in their learning. This can help them develop important skills such as time management, self-discipline, and problem-solving. Additionally, when students are home schooled, they often have more one-on-one time with their teachers, which can help them develop a stronger relationship with their educator and receive more personalized attention.

However, there are also some drawbacks to attending school from home. One of the main concerns is that students may not have the same level of social interaction as they would in a traditional classroom setting. This can be particularly problematic for students who are new to a school or community, as they may struggle to make friends and form meaningful relationships with their peers. Additionally, some students may miss the structure and routine of a traditional school setting, which can make it difficult for them to stay on track with their studies.

Another potential drawback of attending school from home is that it may not provide the same level of job preparation as a traditional school setting. While home schooling can be tailored to a student's individual needs and interests, it may not provide the same level of exposure to a diverse range of subjects and extracurricular activities that a traditional school setting offers. This can make it more difficult for students to be competitive in the job market and may limit their career opportunities.

CE43CDF8BAA4,"The potential impact of the use of social media and technology in education can be both positive and negative. In order to ensure students are receiving accurate and reliable information, relying more heavily on textbooks rather than potential social media or computer sources can be beneficial. Some reasons why textbooks are better sources of academic information include their accuracy, reliability, and appropriateness. Textbooks are typically vetted for accuracy and reliability before they are published and used as course materials, meaning the information they contain is much more reliable than information taken from social media or computer sources. Additionally, the content in textbooks are generally age-appropriate and avoid the potential for inappropriate experiences such as online harassment and cyberbullying.

The potential consequences of allowing students to use technology and social media in schools must also be considered. The use of technology can serve as a distraction, reducing the amount of time a student spends on their schoolwork. Additionally, it may create issues with student privacy and security, as well as cause problems with school policies on the use of technology. 

Allowing students to use their cell phones during class can also have implications, both for the students and for the school. On a positive note, it can enable students to have access to the same resources, such as educational videos and other academic materials, regardless of the technology available in the classroom. On the other hand, it can be highly distracting, causing students to miss key parts of lectures, not pay attention, or become too engrossed in their phones rather than paying attention to the classwork. Finally, it can also lead to a disruption in the classroom, making it difficult for teachers to adequately control students' use of technology.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

9B968665218F,"Dear Florida Senator,

I am here to tell you about the electoral collage, and not why we should keep the horrible thing, but how we can replace it with something better. The electoral collage has been in use for a very long time, since the Constitution was finalized, but it should end now. The Electoral Collage is a confusing system that can easily be manipulated and changed to benifit one political party. As shown in many past elections, it has just become another reason people do not want to vote. Popular vote is easy and simple and it should be used in future elections.

First of all confusion is a huge factor when talking about  the Electoral collage. We as voters do not want all these processes. We do not want hoops that we want to jump through. We are simple people who want a simple process. In the electoral collage,  there are 538 electors, with a majority of 270 needed to be voted in as president. Each state gets entitled to two for your senators, and one for each member of the House of Representatives. This so far is making my head spin. This could be so much simpler if we just used the poular voting system. In this system, the people can directly vote for thier president without any huge hassel. This makes it easier and more fair for the voters. Speaking of fair, lets talk about how Unfair the Electoral Collage is.

In the Electoral Collage, there is no partial winning. It is a winner take all system, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska. This makes it very unfair to votes. Swing states add on to this idea. Swing states are very large states that have a higher representation in the Electoral collage. These are also the main targets of presidential cannidates. By getting these swing states, cannidates can gain a lot of votes in one state. This leaves other states, such as Ohio and Montana with little to no interaction from the presidential cannidates. This is not fair. We need the popular vote system. We need to be able to equally represent everyone without any shady practices. And that is the last topic, the electors really control the final outcome.

The final sin of the electoral collage is just too big to look over. The electoral collage can change wether a person is voted in or not because of the electors. They choose who they represtent. If you can not see where this is going let me explain. A set of people who want a specific president can just represent him. This could go so far as to leave a state with only representatives of one cannidate. This could never happen in popular vote because we don't have electors, we have people. We have real American people who want to vote for who they want to vote for. Nothing more, nothing less.

Even though the Electoral Collage seems like th root of all evil, there are a few upsides. First, there is less likely to have a dispute than a popular vote. A dispute is not impossible, it is just less likely. Second, big states are weighted how they should be. They are larger states that comprise most of the population and the country. They should be represented more than smaller states. Finally, since it is a winner takes all, there are no Run-Off elections. This keeps the process shorter, but not as short as it would be in the popular vote system.

So to conclude, popular vote should be used in upcomming elections. The electoral collage is a confusing system that can easily be manipulated to help or hurt a specific cannidate. Although the electoral collage properly represent smaller states and avoids Run-Off elections, it does not represent smaller states and can easly shift the election from one side to another. Popular vote keeps the process short and makes it fair. It represents everyone fairly. I do not want you to agree with me, I want you to look and the cold hard facts. Popular vote should be used in the Election from now on.

CBFDC3A0F573,"Distance learning

Some schools offer distance learning as an option students to attend classes from home by away of online of video conferencing; some students take this way to learn, but the purpose to learn is get it very well. That mean this is better when you go to school with people that is already qualified to teach the stuffs you need to learn in your process, and basically, they are there for everything you need to ask them. But what happen when you take the way to learn away? there are a couple things to talk.

First, you always need to ask questions, and I think this is the most important obstacle,for example: you do not have someone to ask immediately, that is a big benefit to be in class, some people need more than one time to understand a topic or an exercise. May be in a test you need an explication for a question that you do not understand and there is a big problem. This may work when you live far away from a civilization, or you are sick with something strong and is not easy move you body. If you have to work, that is another valid reason to take some classes in your computer because you need time to make money to pay your bills.

Second,you can cheat on the quizzes or even in the big tests that the school assigned to you. If must students cheat being in the school with someone supervising, you can do it at your home too; may be take some notes out, or search in Google some answers, or call a friend with the phone, even ask to your mom or your dad in your home. That mean you are not learning and you never going to learn if you are cheating. After this, you just getting a good grade bad nothing of knowledge and that is why we need some extra help, a person who answer our questions.

Third, the work assigned to the students from the school is not too easy, those are a couple pages and some exercises to do for just one class, so you have to read and understand all by yourself and answer the questions, send that to your teacher and wait until the next document with the exact same dynamic, and that is how you are ÃÂ¨ learning ÃÂ¨, reading papers, and answer questions. Must of the students does not pass the class, the arguments from them are that no one explain very well the way that they have to do the work and when the test comes they do not know nothing. As I said, you still can ask the teacher or look for help in internet, but is not the same thing.

Finally, most of the students has to take the class again, losing all their time that they been doing putting in that class. After all that process, they understand the important to be with someone helping you and not be away from the school. A lot of teachers say that is not a good choice take distance learning, they say is hard and be alone is more difficult, but as I said, I think is good for the people who really cant assist to school.                       ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
97A0FFE91A3E,"Hey there!  Today, I'm gonna write about why extending the school day by one and a half hours would be super beneficial for both students and teachers. 

First off, let's talk about the students. An extra one and a half hours in school means we can learn more stuff!  Like, imagine having more time to explore science experiments, or learn a new language, or even get extra help with math problems that are giving us trouble.  It's like, we'd have more time to discover new things and expand our knowledge! 

But it's not just about learning more stuff, it's also about having more time to be creative!  Like, we could have more time to work on art projects, or write stories, or even make videos!  It's like, our minds would be able to wander and explore new ideas without feeling rushed. 

And let's not forget about the teachers!  They would love having more time to help us learn and grow!  They could give us more individual attention, or work with us on projects, or even just have more time to explain things to us.  It's like, they'd have more time to be there for us and make sure we're understanding the material. 

Plus, having more time in school means we'd have more time to socialize and make new friends!  Like, we could hang out with our classmates during breaks, or even start clubs or groups that interest us!  It's like, we'd have more time to connect with each other and build relationships. 

In conclusion, extending the school day by one and a half hours would be super beneficial for both students and teachers!  It would give us more time to learn, be creative, and connect with each other.  So, let's hope our school considers this idea!

953BEF800163,"The decision to complete a full four years of high school before moving on to college is an important one. While there may be some drawbacks to leaving high school early, the benefits of completing a full four years of high school are numerous.

Firstly, completing a full four years of high school can help students prepare for their future. High school provides students with a foundation of knowledge and skills that are necessary for success in college and beyond. A four-year high school experience can also provide students with the opportunity to take advanced courses and pursue their interests in depth. This can help students identify their strengths and weaknesses and make informed decisions about their future education and career paths.

Secondly, completing a full four years of high school can also help students develop important life skills. High school provides students with the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities, volunteer work, and internships. These experiences can help students develop leadership skills, teamwork skills, and communication skills, which are all valuable in both personal and professional settings.

However, there are potential drawbacks to leaving high school early. For example, some students may not be ready for the rigors of college-level coursework. Additionally, leaving high school early may limit the number of opportunities available to students, such as scholarships and financial aid.

There are also examples of students who had difficulty succeeding in college after leaving high school early. For instance, some students may struggle to adapt to the different learning environment of college, or they may struggle to balance their coursework with other responsibilities such as work or family.

In conclusion, completing a full four years of high school before moving on to college can provide numerous benefits for students. A four-year high school experience can help students prepare for their future, develop important life skills, and provide a foundation of knowledge and skills necessary for success in college and beyond.

43E52415FDFE,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author claims that Venus is a worthy planet for us to examine more closely. Venus is unihabitable and its impossible, with the technology we have today, for a human to step foot on venus. So why does the author beleive its a good idea to send humans to study this dangerous planet?

I beleive the author supports his idea that studying Venus would be a good idea very well. Although Venus is uninhabitable and dangerous for humans the author shares many solid facts that throughly support his claim. For example the author states in paragraph 4 that ""it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system."" The author also shares that Venus may have once supported forms of life. I beleive these two facts alone could spark interest in the reader and get him/her to want to know more about whats on Venus. In paragraph 4 the author also states that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. I beleive this fact supports the authors claim very well. Not only does the author provide facts that sparks the readers interests he also provides logical ways and evidence of how scientists can get humans to Venus. In paragraph 5 the author says ""NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" meaning NASA might be able to create a vehicle that can float above all the dangers of Venus.

Despite the dangers and extreme conditions of venus the author still supports his claim with logical facts and resonable ideas. I beleive he supports his claim very well. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
7D1825E2F4AD,"Self-reliance is a crucial aspect of a person's life, and it can help individuals feel secure when making decisions. Self-reliance refers to the ability to rely on oneself for support and guidance, rather than relying on others. In this essay, I will analyze how self-reliance can help people feel secure when taking decisions and determine what matters in life.

Firstly, self-reliance can help individuals feel secure when making decisions because it allows them to trust their own instincts and beliefs. When people are self-reliant, they are able to make decisions based on their own values and principles, rather than being swayed by the opinions of others. This can be especially important when making decisions that have long-term consequences, such as choosing a career path or starting a family.

Secondly, self-reliance can help individuals feel secure when taking decisions because it allows them to take responsibility for their choices. When people are self-reliant, they are able to take ownership of their decisions and the outcomes of those decisions. This can help them feel more confident in their choices and more in control of their lives.

Thirdly, self-reliance can help individuals feel secure when making decisions because it allows them to focus on what truly matters in life. When people are self-reliant, they are able to prioritize their own needs and values, rather than being influenced by external factors such as societal expectations or the opinions of others. This can help them live a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

In conclusion, self-reliance can help individuals feel secure when making decisions by allowing them to trust their own instincts and beliefs, take responsibility for their choices, and focus on what truly matters in life. By cultivating self-reliance, individuals can gain a sense of confidence and control over their lives, which can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful existence.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,9

Cellular devices is becoming a big part of some life. In which one has to be on it while doing everything such as eating, taking shower, working, and everyone favorite driving. Studies have found that distracted driver crashes was because of an cellular device. However, many continue to use their devices while driving and don't see the problem with it. Driving while on a device could be dangerous for you and whoever else is around you resulting in someone being injured or even killed. On a device while driving should not be prohibited and should have harsher consequences for those that do do.

In the present day, there is studies going on that proves that 1 in 4 of car accidents in the United States had been an result of texting while driving. In which, at any given time throughout the day, about 650,000 are wanting to use their cellular device while operating an automobile. These devices have became a big part in our everyday lives. However, it becomes a dangerous risks if someone want to decide check social media or any mobile applicant while operating a vehicle. Cell phone distracts are very high that why laws are put in place so that people have consequences for those that break laws put others in danger. Including the fact that 94 percent of drivers would support the ban to stop driving while texting and 74 percent support an ban on hand-held cell phone usage.

Laws such as Hand-held Cell Phone Use Ban, All Cell Phone Ban, and Text Messaging Ban are put in place to prevent crashes and a drivers distraction from the road. The Hand-held Cell Phone Use Ban is in 16 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands prohibit all drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving. While the Text Messaging Ban is in 47 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands ban text messaging for all drivers with Missouri prohibits text messaging by novice or teen drivers. So States like Georgia, Louisiana, Washington, Oregon, and Maine have it were you will get fined $100-$500 for break these laws. But states Alaska and Utah can fine you $750-$10,000 or even one year of imprisonment.

Most of these laws are created and being enforced so that someone won't put their life or lives of others in danger.

4CB975113547,"To begin with, students already have to go through after school and other stuff at home like chores, homework, play outside. If the principal decided to do this type of action, the students may go rogue due to them having to do this extra work outside of school or inside of school. Some students may be happy because some of these extra curriculum activities include sports which is a really easy way for the basketball students of the school to get the extra curriculum activity point.

My point is that if students have to do this extra activity during school hours or off school grounds it will get very hectic and crazy because students may have a full schedule and cant do the extra work. Also students may find that the activities they have to do are not their interest and may not find anything they like for them to do this extra activity.

If students stay after school, the teacher might not be available at the time, too much people might stay after school, there might be more kaos.

Sometimes the teacher is available at a specific time. If the teacher leaves at 2:15 for an appointment, the students cant go to that teachers classroom and have to go to another teachers classroom (Which is already full) and crowd the classroom and that teacher has to put a lot of effort to calm the class down or get their attention.

If a majority of the students stay after school on one particular day, they have to go to a classroom to get the activity point or they have to go to the gym. If the students are too many, they have to split them into different room which are already full and make them fit into the room. If the students decide to go to the gym for the extra curriculum to do sports, they might have to wait a long time for a game to end so they can use the equipment thats available. The more students there are, the more kaos there will be. If students stayed after to do activities, they might take advantage of this time and start to horse around. If the principal decided this, the janitors might have to stay late and clean up some messes that some classrooms, bathroom, hallways have due to some students that horsed around.

Some students may decide to do some of the extra activities outside of school which may result in stress, less time with friends and family, and may not have time to do the activities.

As students try to find time to do these activities they might develop stress as they try to change some of their schedule to fit a time to work on these extra activities. As stress increases they might develop anger and sadness as they keep trying and trying and trying to fit this activity. Some students have a semi-full schedule and have time to do it, but as they keep doing the activity they might spend less time with family and friends. If students dont spend time with their family, they might become suicidal and start to do drugs and start drinking since they know that their parents are not around. Some students may not just have time at all. They think they have time but as the day goes on, their parents might say ""lets go to Walmart!"" or ""Lets go shopping!"" and come back very late and dont have time anymore to do it.

If the principal decides to put this rule into action students may become stressed, spend less time with friends and family or have no time to do it. If the students stay after school to do the activities, they school will have too much people staying after, more kaos, and the teacher not being available causing the class to split and go to different classrooms.

My point is that the principal should not pass this rule because it will have a domino effect and cause many bad things and will put more tension on the school.                                                                                                                                                                                                  ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
72271FDE4F35,"Driverless cars might not be just a myth or a fantasy anymore. Google has had cars that can drive independantly since 2009. Though they have gone more than half a million miles without a crash, there are cons to these typs of cars. They arn't entirely driverless yet. These cars still need help getting through places like work zones and accidents. These cars are expensive and still need human help, but they do come with a special safety feature that normal cars don't have.

Driverless cars can be helpful, but they are still expensive. The roads would more than likely have to be updated. General Motors and engineers from Berkeley have both tried different ways to improve the roads. This included roads embedded with electrical cables or magnets, sending signals to the car. These methods proved to be unreasonably expensive. Engineers then looked at making smarter cars. To make them smart enough to drive safely without the help of people and smart roads they would need many sensors. They would need at least nine different sensors. Putting that many sensors on enough cars for everyone to drive would be very costly.

People could also benefit from these cars if they truly were driverless. These so called ""driverless"" cars can't do many things a person can do while driving. For instance, these cars can't pull in or out of driveways. They also can't make it through roadwork or accidents. Currently, the fastest that driverless cars can handle is 25 miles per hour. This would definitly not be safe on a highway or interstate. These cars are ment to take people where they need to go, but the driver must remain focus if they need to take the wheel.

There are pros to cars like these though. There has to be something to keep the ""driver"" interested while waiting for their turn to drive, so some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment. If there is something that keeps the driver entertained, there has to be something to get them alert again. These entertainment features can be turned off when needed, pulling the drivers attention back to the road. These safety percautions arn't currently in cars for texting and driving.

Though these cars do come with a safety feature, they are still expensive and can't fully drive alone. I do believe the world can benefit from these cars, but i see to many red flags for them to be reasonable at this time. ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
650843b9,"Cars nowadays are a big part of our lifes, they take us to where we need to go and help us go to far away places. Even though cars are important in our lifes, there are lot of advantages to limited car usage. Some places such as VAUBAN, Germany have given up their cars. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" This results in less people owning or having cars and reducing green house gas emissions from tailpipe. ""passengers cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gases emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" source 1. Private ownership of cars are slowly choking our cities, if we limit our car usage little by little it may have a huge effect in our ecosystem.

In continuation, there have been situations where the air pollution got so bad that they had to ban driving so they could clear the air. For example in Paris, ""after days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city""source 2. The drivers were fined a 22euro fine if they did not leave their cars at home. In the end the smog cleared and the French party recinded the ban for oddnumbered plates. This is one of the many examples that proves that just by having less cars driving around it eventually changes the way the atmosphere looks and cleans the atmosphere a little.

Smog is a sign of high air pollution, it indicates that the air is not healthy and this can be harmful to our environment. ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" As indicated in the passagesource 3, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", just one day without cars can reduce smog imagine if we go weeks without a huge number of cars driving around. This idea might sound crazy to some people but it has surprisingly helped the environment. This however is not the only advantage of reducing car usage. Some other advantages are that if we go to our jobs in a bike everyday or just go for a walk instead of a drive we are also being more productive and active, hence making us healthier.

Although some people might find leaving their cars behind is a bad idea, studies have shown that people who do so gets used to the idea and find less reason to resume the habit of car commuting. For example instead of driving to the beach we should ride our bikes or take public busses to get there. Without cars we learn to appreciate the beauty of nature more and notice things about the place were we live that we have never seen before. I have came to notice that when you are driving you really dont notice things because you are to busy focusing on the road, but when u have a walk around your neighborhood or anywhere for that matter you see things you have never noticed before and you leaarn to appreciate nature more. The idea of leaving our cars behind is hard for some people, but if you think about the effect it will have on the environment it is worth it.

In conclusion, carfree cities might sound like a joke to some people but it is helping out in clensing our environment increasingly. As indicated in the passage, ""The End Of Car Culture"", ""If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of Americas emissions, just behind power plants."" We are responsible for how our environment is going to look like in the future years, wouldnt it be better for it to look like a beautiful clear sunny day or a foggy grey fuss?

F17F4DF6095D,"The proverb ""Honesty is the best policy"" is one of the most widely used and recognized sayings in the English language. It is a simple yet profound statement that suggests that being truthful is the most important thing in any situation. However, this proverb is not without its controversies and complexities. In this essay, I will analyze the implications of being honest, examine the consequences of dishonesty, evaluate the potential benefits of being truthful, explore the negative repercussions of dishonesty, and create a conclusion that summarizes the views expressed in the essay.

Being honest can have both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, it can help to build trust and strengthen relationships. When people are honest with each other, they can rely on each other and feel secure in their interactions. Additionally, honesty can help to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts that may arise from dishonesty. On the negative side, being honest can sometimes hurt people's feelings. For example, if someone is honest about their opinions or feelings, it may offend or upset others. It is important to consider the potential consequences of honesty before acting.

The consequences of dishonesty can be severe. Stealing, cheating, lying, and hiding important information can all have negative repercussions. For example, stealing can lead to financial loss and damage to relationships. Cheating can lead to academic failure and damage to one's reputation. Lying can lead to mistrust and damage to relationships. Hiding important information can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. These consequences can be long-lasting and difficult to overcome.

Being truthful can have many potential benefits. For example, it can help to build trust and strengthen relationships. It can also help to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts that may arise from dishonesty. Additionally, being truthful can help to maintain one's integrity and self-respect.

B4CBDAF1161C," In recent years, there has been a debate about whether classes such as art, music, and drama should be electives or required for students. While some people argue that allowing students to choose their own classes is important, others believe that requiring these classes is necessary for students to gain experience and contribute to the culture of the nation.

One argument in favor of making these classes elective is that students should be allowed to make their own decisions about what they want to learn. This allows them to pursue their interests and passions, rather than being forced to take classes that they may not enjoy. Additionally, elective classes can provide students with a more personalized education, as they can choose from a variety of options that fit their individual needs and learning styles.

However, there are also arguments in favor of making these classes required. For example, requiring students to take classes in art, music, and drama can provide them with valuable experience and skills that they can use in the future. These classes can help students develop their creativity, communication skills, and problem-solving abilities, which can be beneficial in many different areas of life. Additionally, requiring these classes can help to promote cultural awareness and appreciation, as students are exposed to different forms of art and music from around the world.

Ultimately, the decision about whether to make classes in art, music, and drama elective or required will depend on the specific needs and goals of the school and community. While allowing students to make their own choices can be beneficial, requiring these classes can also provide students with valuable experience and skills that can benefit them in the future.

4F5A0012432A,"Dear Principal,

I have heard about your plan to change the school's policy on grade point average and how it affects a student's extracurricular activities. I personally believe that a 'B' average is to high and believe that the current 'C' average should stay in place.

I know many students who have a 'C' average because the did poorly on one or two tests over concepts they did not grasp or students who have hit a rough patch. I do not believe that the school should punish someone who simply did not grasp a concept or had a hard time with a lesson. Everyone faces that challenge, it just effects students differently.

In addition to that on our grading scale a 'C' is listed as ""average"".

The ""average"" student is indeed involved in extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs, ""average"" students hit that rough patch mentioned above, ""average"" students still give class there all and work hard to try to no longer be ""average"".

I also have a question to ask about your new policy.

What if a student who is currently on a team start to achieve an 'C' average, who is to be monitoring that. Is it the coach or sponsor, the teachers, you- the principal, is the student supposed to take that responsibility of coming forth and suspending or evening expelling him/her from the team or club they are involved in?

I bring this point forward because in each of these situations it is unfair or time consuming for the man or women in question. If the team coach or club sponsor checks grades then its is time consuming for them, most school coaches and sponsors being teachers themselves would not want to take another hour out of their day to check grades of each member/player. If the teachers of these students monitor their grades they also come at the time consuming element of it along with the fact that it is not the teachers responsibility to check up on the student and his/her outside-of-school life. If you are going to be screening grades ma'am you already are very busy and I could not find you having the time to screen all the club members and players at our school to see if they made the grade. The only option left is the student.

I know this places great responsibility on him or her to do there very best in class, but what about a boy on the basketball team who gives math class his all but cant seem to pass that one test, knows he is going to be kicked off the team, made fun of and questioned on why he was kicked off and now upset and hurt by the torment of strangers along with his friends.

This are just a few things to think about when making your decision on the school's policy on grade point average and how it affects a student's extracurricular activities. Though, as you see here, there a lot against it.

One quote that has always resonated with me is the one by Winston Churchill, which states that ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This quote highlights the importance of failure and the role it plays in achieving success. In this essay, I will explore how failure, hope, and enthusiasm are the three keys to success in life.

Firstly, failure is a crucial aspect of achieving success. It is often said that you cannot succeed without failing first. This is because failure teaches us valuable lessons and helps us to grow as individuals. When we fail, we are forced to reflect on our actions and identify areas where we need to improve. This introspection can lead to new insights and a greater understanding of ourselves and the world around us. Additionally, failure can also serve as motivation to work harder and strive for better outcomes in the future.

Secondly, hope is an essential component of success. Hope is the belief that something positive will happen in the future, and it is what drives us to keep pushing forward even when things get tough. Without hope, it can be difficult to find the motivation to keep going, especially when faced with obstacles and setbacks. Hope provides us with the strength to persevere and to keep working towards our goals, even when things don't go as planned.

Lastly, enthusiasm is a critical factor in achieving success. Enthusiasm is the passion and excitement that drives us to pursue our goals and dreams. It is what motivates us to take action and to put in the hard work required to achieve our objectives. Enthusiasm is the fuel that powers our engines and helps us to overcome the challenges and obstacles that we face along the way.

In conclusion, failure, hope, and enthusiasm are the three keys to success in life. Failure teaches us valuable lessons and helps us to grow as individuals, hope provides us with the strength to persevere and to keep working towards our goals, and enthusiasm is the passion and excitement that drives us to pursue our dreams and put in the hard work required to achieve our objectives. By embracing these three principles, we can increase our chances of achieving success and living a fulfilling life.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,1

It's important to start thinking about what I want to do after high school, and one career that has always caught my attention is being a lawyer. I want to learn more about this profession and what it takes to become one.

Researching different colleges and their requirements, I found out that most law schools require a bachelor's degree in any field, but some prefer candidates with a degree in a related field like political science or criminal justice. Additionally, law schools typically require applicants to take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and have a strong academic record. It's also important to have good grades in challenging courses, like advanced math and science, as these will help me prepare for the rigorous coursework in law school.

Staying out of trouble and creating a positive image around myself is also crucial. I know that lawyers are held to high standards of conduct and ethics, and any legal or disciplinary issues can make it harder for me to get into law school or practice law in the future. So, I need to make sure I stay focused and work hard to achieve my goals.

To learn more about the profession of being a lawyer, I've been asking questions and doing research on the job requirements, duties, and legal practices. I've learned that lawyers represent clients in court, help them navigate the legal system, and provide legal advice. They also have to stay up to date on changes in the law and regulations, and they often work long hours to meet deadlines and prepare cases.

I've also been learning about the different types of lawyers, such as criminal lawyers, family lawyers, and corporate lawyers. Each type of lawyer has different responsibilities and areas of expertise, and I'm interested in learning more about each one. For example, criminal lawyers help defend people accused of crimes, while family lawyers handle issues like divorce and child custody.

Finally, I've been asking questions and learning as much as possible about how lawyers help people by representing their cases. I've learned that lawyers play a crucial role in ensuring that their clients' rights",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

Exploring Venus to study is infact dangerous but as the aouthor states in the text "" Today, Venus still has some features that are analgous to thos on Earth"". This line explains that the possibilities of surving in Venus is about 50/50, it also meant that if Venus has these various feathers that Earth have, then it's the chances of being able to go there is hiher because of feathers like; oceans, valleys, mountains, craters, and differnt forms of life. It also says that "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"".

This is significant because it explained how the NASA already have plans and intructions for this event that they are hoping to make it happen. Furthermore, it says how the process and devices would help them to go on Venus and how it is survivable for humans because the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, and machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to the NASA's knowledge of Venus.

Taking this opportuniy had opened up a whole new world for me. I think you should join because you get to see unbelieveable historic buildings, sculptures, and you even get to visit old towns that have water for roads! Another reason that I thought was cool was to help other people in need and even only if you help one person you feel like a hero, this is the whole point of this program. You also get some free time, you do not have to work 24-7, for example "" The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the emptyholds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tornaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games had also helped pass the time."" The learning of the awareness also opens up opportunities to host and run facilities about this issue of people in need.

562CE0C58932,"These sources focus on the advantages of limiting car usage. The usage of cars has been decreasing as the years go by, not only in the United States, but in other countries as well. The residents of certain countries are beginning to use walking or taking a train or a city bus as a means of transportation instead of using their cars, that is if they own one.

The advantages of limiting car usage are endless. One advantage is that it relieves a big amount of stress on people. According to source one, having a car is a big responsibility, sometimes one that certain people are not able to handle. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Not having a car or avoiding having to use a car is becoming easier for people. For people that live in suburban areas, public transportation is going to have a higher demand. This is because there is an attempt to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are going to be placed a walk away, or on a main street, rather than having them all together in malls along a distant highway. Not only will it make it easier for people to access stores or other necessities, but the money that the public transportation will receive will go to the city, giving them more to use on important things the community needs. Furthermore, it is evident that limiting car usage relieves a big amount of stress on people.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it brings people and countries together for a cause. Limiting the use of cars is spreading worldwide and there are many people that agree with this concept. According to the third source, in Bogota, Colombia, a program has been started that is set to lower the rate of care usage and increase the usage of public transprortation. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city empty and unoccupied. The interactions between the community are inevitable with so much people walking and being all in one place at one time. Furthermore, the act of a car-free day is also spreading to other countries. Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were extremely enthusiastic. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. With this act spreading and moving across borders into other countries, the use of cars will soon begin to decrease even more than it already has. This will help to lower the pollution as well as other economic problems caused by cars.

888EFFEEF4A6,"Dear Principal,

I think its unfair that students need at least a ""B"" to participate in any after school activities such as sports or clubs. Students spend more than seven hours a day at school. Sometimes it can be very stressful. With homework or test or even having to wake up so early in the morning. This is why i believe students should have the ability to relax after school and do fun things with their friends. I'm sure you can suggest other possible ideas for not having after school sports or activities. For example, suggest tutors, parent help or even teacher help. The teachers will best understand the assignments or topic and maybe the student doesn't understand. There are other ways for dealing with it. Sports and activities are very popular and a big thing in a kids life. Plus they need physical exercise to stay fit and you should not take that away. I know having a ""C"" isn't great but give them time to catch up and get a ""B"" or better an ""A"". Also, there needs to be something wrong with how things our being tough if most students have C' s This is your fault for not teaching them right or good enough. The students need to understand things in order to learn and get good grades.

But, have a new policy. Which is help the students learn better. Possibly make a club where students can come do there homework and get help when they don't understand something. School is a place to learn but also to have fun. Teach things more understandable so that we can enjoy the fun thing like sports and clubs. Sports can be a huge part in a persons life. It can make you a professional athlete or a young actress, by participating in basketball or drama club. If things are going on at home for a student like family issues they may not want to be at home with all the fighting, they would want to be at school, having fun with their friends. If you took away these privileges you'll just start more of a fight with the parents and students. Maybe it might even make students grades worse, because of all the stress and school and not being able to let it out by doing sports, clubs and activities. Also think of the coaches point of view. It is their job to teach them, but how can they when you wont let them. This is obviously something they love doing and know they get to teach it to other young students. What if you were a kid at this school? What if you had these activities taken away from you? How would this affect you? This is why I strongly believe the policy should not change and stay the same.

I am against the new policy change. I think that the new policy change witch states if students have lower than a grade B average that they may not participate in sports or other activities is not a good idea if most kids have a grade C average because then the school might not have enough kids to make a school football team or basketball or baseball or any other school team sports. If the school doesn't have enough kids to make a hole team then the kids that do meet the requirements of a grade B average wont be able to play on the school team. Also some kids that try there hardest might not be able to reach a grade B average in witch would result in them not being able to participate in sports or other activities even though the kids are trying as hard has they can.

B4862797CA5D,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? What do you guys think that student can do it on there own?.Many student learn in different ways;some students like to work together and others like to work alone in a quiet place where they can focus on there work or what they are thinking;other students like to play around and not do there work. I feel like we would be more successful if we had a little more time in out class if we work in a quiet place. we will be something in life by taking this classes from home and not wasting time with our life. This are my two reason why I said it was a good idea and a bad idea that student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

The reason why i said yes,students would get benefits from being able to attend classes from home. You would have more time to do work at home. Will be able to work in a quite place where no one can bother you or lose focus from your work. If you have any emergency or have not finish your work you can always go back to it at any time. I fell like you would be able to move on and learn more then others that don't work you pace. On the other hand some students need more classes to graduate or to catch up with their credits. If you finish early you would be able to have time with your family,friend or have time to sleep. I feel like you would be able to do it when you try your best with and taking time with it. It's good because you can get work done without anyone bothering you it just you and the computer.

The reason why i said no,students would not get benefits from being able to attend classes from home Because some student like to be lazy to do their work. When it come to work at home we would rather slept the whole day. we would have forgotten that we had work to because it just slip out of my mind or doing something important. we would have been getting work in late so it won't be counted as full credit. They would rather be doing other thing,for an example playing video games,be playing outside,or being lazy all day long. There might be a question that you may not know and ask someone else and they might not know ether. The reason i said no was because not all student would not try to get there work done or not try there best to keep up what they need. Some teacher think we can or we can not because we have proven our self to them. Half of us don't learn and still mess around with other people then doing work that we are suppose to do and learn new thing.

In conclusion this are my reason why students would or wouldn't get benefit by being able to attend classes at home. In my knowledge students are taking classes from home. What i know is that some student are trying there best and other are are just giving up on it. I know that i am suppose to take a class at home to catch up with my credits. i am going to try my best to try to get a good income. I hope i would not get a bad benefit out of this. It's our chose to take the class or not only if we need it and only if you want to be successful in life.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
F6F60CA6E983,"I think we should keep the electoral collage beacause it has worked this long for us so we know its gonna work so why not keeep it going. It keeps a steady stream when it comes time to vote because aslong as someone had 270 votes you know thats who will get picked. so why try changing that and have a whole new system put in and then not know what to do when it comes time to vote. And what if the new system dosent work, what if the new way of the voting process messes with the tallys and they come out wrong and no one will get picked, unlike the other way when u know everything will come out right and u know that we will have a president. I think its fair that they have it set at 270 for voting that way everyone havs a chance to vote instead of it being so low that only a few people get to vote before they shut it down because they have reached there number of tallys that they need.  So if they change the number of tallys that a president needs to become president that will be stupid and people will act out on it because they wont think its right, and because the people who didnt vote will not like the fact that they didnt get to put there vote f in before they stoped the voting and because they meet the number that they needed. Its a vote why do they need to title it as a the vote of a president or a popular vote of a president. Why not just vote for there just electors instead of saying vote for your candidate when really you are just voting for the electors. If you are voting for a certin thing there is no reason that u have to re-word it just to vote, if you are voting for something do it the right way instead of changing stuff and making it seem one way when really its the other way. Why should the electoral get just as much as the winning presindent? They are not doing as much as the president  and who is helping him out.. so they should not get the same reword.

DDFF2C1D1A58,"In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. After personally reading this article, I believe a driverless car would be a positive impact on the road today. The article mentions many positive things including fuel efficency, crash proof, advanced safety sensors, and an understanding computer that knows when driving is too difficult for its self. I believe that driverless cars will become a positive impact due to extreme environmental safety, driver safety, and intelligent computer understanding.

In the first paragraph, the author states that, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."". In our environment, we have had many mishaps dealing with cars and the pollution they cause to our environment from the day they were made. When the author states that the driverless cars would use half the fuel as that of a taxi, it brings hope for the environment that so far no popular vehicle could provide. The cars will not only be protecting the environment, but also humans.

The author informs us that the driverless car has gone ""half a millon miles without a crash""(P2) which is a major factor when it comes to the health and well being of humans on and around the roadways. The author continues to talk about Google's modified car that, ""needed a whole lot of sensors""(P4) and ""had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids""(P5). To a beginning driver like myself, a car can be very overwhelming with everything and one you must beware of. The driverless cars are decked out with sensors and cameras to do exactly that. All of the sensors and montiors will help the driver and passagers continue driving without the worry of an accident unlike how driving is now. The driverless not only have smart sensors, they also have smart minds.

The driverless car comes with an extreme amount of sensors for protection but the car is also so smart, it understands when driving is beyond it's ability and that a human must drive in this area. The author tells us just how smart these cars are, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.""(P7). The driverless car is not exactly driverless yet, but it is due to the important promise that anyone in or around the driverless car will be safe.

In conclusion, the driverless car is more fuel efficent and environmentally safe compared to the vehicles we drive today. Not only is the driverless car safe to the environment though, it is also safe to all passengers and pedestrians. The driverless car has many sensors and cameras so that when it is driving, it is as if an aware human is driving instead. The driverless car does have its limits though but it is not afraid to admit it. When roadways become too difficult of the car to drive its self, the car informs the driver when his/her turn is to drive. The driverless is a fall proof, safe car to be driving on our roads today. I am personally excited and very supportive of the newest autopilot car to arrive this year in 2016, and so should you.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
F5BB40767917,"Dear Principle,

Students should be allowed to use phones during free times at school, because if a student is sad and doesn't have any friends they would possible want to talk to a family member they could just call on there free time not during class and talk to that person reducing there sadness or anger. If they couldn't be able to talk to no one they would be mad and take it out on someone else causing fights. Students would be more focused on there cell phone instead of drama and fights going on and possible using cell phones during school would reduce fights and complications in the school.

If a teacher takes a students phone away because they were hiding it just to use it at lunch it would just cause more problems and also the principle doesn't need to have to worry about that stuff, you have enough problems to deal with as it is, you don't need another one as simple as just using cell phones in school. Also students wouldn't have to try so hard just to be on there cell phone. They wouldn't have to worry about when to try and sneak to use there phone, instead they could be worried about there school work as much. Also if students was talking on there phone and sneaking around school to use it they could get in trouble or miss there class either way kids will still want to use there phones. So I think they should make an agreement instead of someone not getting what they want and doing something else causing to get in trouble.

If it was an emergency at home and couldn't wait and the student couldn't pick up there phone the situation would have been worse. Plus students if they were lost in a school and in danger they would need something to contact an adult. The world is always coming up with new technology that children will just keep using and the cell phones would have upgraded and more interesting to kids. So you the principle should consider that the school should have a cell phone policy saying that students can use there phones during lunch and free times.

Everyone has the opportunity to achieve their goals and make something great, but it takes determination and a willingness to take risks.

First, every person has a dream that they want to achieve in life.

Every person has the opportunity to achieve their dreams, and it's important to stay focused and determined to make it happen.

Second, every person takes a great decision to achieve a great thing. For example, a person who is playful and doesn't pay attention in class may take a decision to stop playing and start studying, and they may be happy with the results. Another example is a teacher who tells their students that working together is the best way to achieve success, but some students may decide to work alone and still achieve great things.

2533a9a5,"The electoral college, a mistake? Many Americans are unsatisfied with the electoral college and the system it follows. The electoral college has disappointed millions of Americans of any social class. According to The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , by Bradford Plummer, "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the electors, who in turn elect the president."" America should abolish the electoral college as it has upset 60 percent of americans and elected unwanted Presidents.

""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency"", as said by Bradford Plummer. Every year Americans fall stricken by disappointment from the electoral college. The system of the electoral college is a poor representation of american ideals as candidates do not even bother spending time in nonswing states. According to Bradford Plummer, in the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not even see the candidates at all and 25 percent of the largest media markets did not even see a single campaign ad. As previously proven, the electoral college must be abolished due to the unfairness of its system.

The electoral college believers say that the electoral college stops disaster from happening, this is false. As Americans vote they vote for a slate of electors, which definitely creates a loss of the opposing or minority votes. This is because of the winnertakesall system that the electoral college runs off of. When the majority of the votes is accounted for, the minority votes are basically thrown away in a sense. Also, the electoral college ruins the chance of a more correct voting experience for old and new voters, making Americans ashamed and unwilling to vote because of the feeling of their vote meaning nothing or perhaps being crippled by the electoral college.

When the founding fathers of America created the electoral college it was an age without technology, making the electoral college a grand idea. Long ago, the electoral college served a patriotic and noble purpose as their was no technology and much less people. In todays age of technology, the record keeping and election process could not get any better as long as the electoral college is abolished and never reincarnated. The electoral college abolishes individual votes for the majority, crippling the American voting experience and smuthering it in shame and disappointment. The electoral college is outdated in many ways and should be dismissed from America.

In conclusion, the electoral college is shaming Americans from every state. This system should be permanantly abolished becuase of its lack of fairness and reliability. Every American vote should count just as much as its opposing vote instead of being dismissed. Free the vote and let the electoral college be forever dismissed of its dutys.",0,train_essays,,7

Dear Senator I strongly suggest you on changing to election by popular vote and getting rid of the Electoral College. As you can see on the quote above people really don't like the Electoral College. This would be a very wise decision because the Electoral College is very old and unfair and it cause many crisis to happened.

First and foremost the Electoral College is very old.

It states in the article ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong"" ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

This quote explains how the electoral college is getting old and unfair so we should start fresh with a new change from electoral college to popular vote. Also the electoral college sometimes causes many crisis.

It states in the article "" The single best argument against the electoral college is that we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the century; the system allows for much worse.""

This quote explains how the electoral college caused a fiasco in 2000 because of the electoral college and if we don't get rid of it we could have another one of these crisis.

On the other hand the electoral college should not be taken away because our founding fathers established it.

It states in the article ""Source 1: What is the Electoral College?"" ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""

This quote illustrates how the electoral college is suppose to help us and noy hurt us. Also our founding fathers established so they were just trying to get everything in order and have peace with everyone.

Although the electoral college is very unfair because of the winner-take-all system.

It states in the article ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong"" ""At the most basic level, the electoral coolege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state. canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on only the tight race in the ""swing"" states.""

This quote explains how the electoral college is unfair and doesn't give chances to other states that supposively have no chance on voting for that certain canditate.

All in all Senator the electoral college must be abolish. Not only does it create many disasters, but it is very unfair to us citizens. The electoral college is very old and we should give a break. We could start with something fresh like the popular vote and see how it turns out. As you can see there is many evidence on how the electoral college is bad and that you should give the popular vote a chance.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
6E3D46F9AAE1,"As an eighth-grade student, I often find myself limiting myself in various areas of my life. One area where I limit myself is in my social life. I tend to only hang out with a small group of friends and avoid meeting new people. This is because I am afraid of being rejected or judged by others. However, this fear has held me back from growing as a person.

Another area where I limit myself is in my academic pursuits. While I do well in school, I often avoid taking on challenging assignments or seeking out new knowledge. This is because I am afraid of failing or not being good enough. However, this fear has held me back from reaching my full potential.

Dissatisfaction can be natural, but it can also be dangerous. When we are dissatisfied with our lives, it can lead to feelings of unhappiness and even depression. However, dissatisfaction can also be a motivator. It can push us to seek out new experiences and challenge ourselves to grow.

Learning new things and going beyond our knowledge can help us grow as individuals. When we learn new things, we expand our horizons and gain a better understanding of the world around us. This can lead to new opportunities and experiences. Additionally, when we push ourselves to learn new things, we develop a sense of accomplishment and pride in ourselves.

Emerson's statement that ""we should always be going after growth"" is wise because it encourages us to constantly strive for improvement. It reminds us that growth is a lifelong process and that we should never stop learning and growing. This mindset can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

971D0C1C75F0,"Dear Principal,

I completely disagree with your proposed policy change that if passed would not allow students to participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B minimum average. This policy would be unfair to students. It is unacceptable because sports or other activities besides academics are valuable to students. Activities that are not academic related, such as arts and crafts, music, sports, etc. are mandatory in school because school is not just a learning environment for academics and non-academic activities may help students' performance in academic subjects.

Non-academic activities are important in school because children need to be stimulated in all areas, not just academics. If school didn't have music, sports, etc., then students would not be able to exercise their other talents, unless they had opportunities to do so outside of school. School is a place where students grow, and if students are only growing in an academic area, then they are not fully maturing.

Non-academic activities are also required because those activities can help improve students' performance in academics. For example, if a child had a sports elective before his final math exam, he could use the sport to distract himself from being nervous. Once he got to his next class, he was not nervous, and he did well on his test. Performing non-scholastic activities can help performance in scholastic activities.

Overall, Principal, you cannot put this policy in place. It would contradict the purpose of school, and it may degrade the academic performance of students.

They take up less gas, saying ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" Those are just two of many reasons why driveless cars are going to change America.

The small amount that driverless cars have actully driven there hasn't been one issue with crashing into other objects. Yes there are still bugs that still need to be fixed. The cars can not at this time pull out or pull in a driveway, they also can not tell when road work is happening or when there has been a crash on the road. All things when they first start are a little bit buggy but that doesn't mean in two to five years that things could get fixed. When those bugs do get fix we could see a crashless world.

In the artical they are talking about a driverless taxi's sevice, that is more cost friendly and more flexable than the buses. Gas isn't high cost like it use to be but when you're driving people from one part of town to another side, the gas bill started to stack up. Driverless cars always take the shortest route and are just more gas friendly then your average taxi. Cutting that gas bill in half will safe more money to put back into your company or the communtiy. Gas had always been in high demand the driverless car could stop that.

The only thing keeping us from those driveless car in the laws and the bugs that they do have but again in two to five years both of those could have change the way we see cars forever. The prices of gas will fall, there will be less driving issues. The world has we know it will be safer and less popluted with less Co2 coming from every oned cars. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
70E490A83717," Summer is generally preferred over winter by many students. The idea of extending the winter break to be longer than the summer break and having a week off in spring and fall is not a good one. When students return from any break, regardless of the season, they are likely to struggle with retaining information as they have been away for an extended period. A longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. Why should educators think that a longer winter break than summer would help students retain information?

In my opinion, a longer winter break would not be enjoyable for students. They would prefer to enjoy their break and take advantage of the warm weather. Even though students may not be able to retain information on learning targets during their break, at least it would not waste time as it would extend the school year. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either due to the cold weather, and it would not help students remember the information they learned when they were in school. What's a break if you cannot enjoy it?

Moreover, what students could do during their break is to review the things they have learned. Teachers could assign online classes and reviews for students to help them memorize information at least once a week. This way, when students return to school, they would not be so behind on things, and they would be able to remember the objectives taught. A longer winter break could help students remember what they learned, if they were to review and analyze the work given to them in the past.

In conclusion, changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. Overall, there should not be a longer winter break than summer. It would not be enjoyable for students, and it would not help them retain information. Instead, educators should focus on finding ways to make the break enjoyable and productive for students.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

B7C81B9A0C1A,"There are many ways a person can get from one place to another whether it is by bus, plane, train or car. Car and truck transportation is one of the leading causes in air polution. Ruducing the use of cars will be beneficial to the public, not only on the streets, but to the citizens themselves.

To start off, the reduction of cars on the streets will cause less stress to the people who drive them. For example, in Source 1 it shows how a woman is happier and the loss of her car has changed her life for the better. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" she says. The tension of being in a car and waiting in traffic can be stressful and cause people to get impatient, grumpy, and even irritated. The woman proves that her life has changed because she doesn't have to go through that anymore. Her car-less life is the one that makes her happy.

Besides that, not only does car reduction cause better mood for people, but it also lessens the air pollution and makes the enviornment cleaner and better for people to live in. According to Source 4, ""If the pattern persists- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" This proves that when cars are being used less, there is also less carbon emission into the air and that is helpful to the enviornment. This benefits and makes the air cleaner and safer to breathe.

Now with every thing good, there is always a bad. In source 2 it is explained how the delivery companies were complaining of lost revenue. Yes, this will be a problem with the delivery companies, but there are other ways of transporting goods to their destination such as by train, boat etc. Also in Source 2 there were arrangements made for the the cars to go out on certain days, so the delivery companies' problems were not all that bad. The reduction of cars benefits the public more than it what it hurts.

The results of limiting car usage has been greatly proven through studies done (in source 4) and it is believed that it should continue to be limited and or reinforced. The people are happier, the enviornment is safer and the air is clean. There is more help than there is hinder and soon it will be seen throughout the world that cars are better in the garage.                       ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
31465D2CACDF,"Computers are one of the best inventions ever made by humans because they have enabled everybody around the world to connect to the Internet. The Internet fuels most peoples lives because of the sheer amount of accessible information about anything and everything. However, should we let computers start making their own decisions? Thomas Huang is the creator of a computer software that allows computesr to read human emotions using 3-D modeling and analyzing muscle movements in the face. At first glance, this appears to be an interesting concept, but there could be several downsides to this type of invention such as overall practicality, implementation in today's society, and even safety and security issues.

First of all, is a software that can read our emotions actually useful? There is potential for this type of software to be used on people for occasions such as a interrogation where the suspect could be lying and the software could detect a quivering lip. On the other hand, this type of software is most likely not going to make it into the homes of the people which presents a business problem. Their solution is to introduce the software into schools to be used for enhancing the learning experience. Dr Huang describes how computers in the classroom could ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor"" resulting in a better learning environment for the student. The issue is, not every student needs this, and many will prbably disagree with having this software implemented in their school. So, this type of computer software has few areas that it will probably be used causing it to be less practical than it originally seems.

Secondly, how will FACS (Facial Action Coding System) be implemented into a society that is normally unwilling to new changes regarding their technology? People want improvements, but they don't want change. For example, when an application has an update most people update it without giving it a second thought because the newer it is the more likely it will be ""better"" than the previous version. But, when a new phone comes out with plenty of changes people are skeptical and wait for their friend to buy it before they consider purchasing one themselves. So, as a result, people will most likely be skeptical of a software that is able to read emotions because it is something new and no one has any experiences with it yet. This causes FACS to seem like a software that won't be implemented or at least widespread for a long time.

Lastly, will the common person feel like their privacy is being invaded with this new software? For FACS to work the user must have a camera or some kind of scanning device that is able to detect individual muscles. A highly accurate scanning device in the common home will most definitely scare some people out of having this type of software. For example, some people believe that they are already watched through their smartphone camera even though they don't have any form of evidence of such actions taking place. A natural fear of invasion of privacy is part of human nature and cannot be changed. In paragrpah seven D'Alto, the author, mentions that FACS can detect a fake and a real smile which only solidifies the softwares scanning precision. What if someone was talking with their boss using their computer and they lied to protect their job? Although this kind of action should result in that person being punished or fired FACS could use the camera on the computer to see that they were lying and report it to the person's boss or company. Now, this situation is impractical and hopefully it never happens, but the idea that FACS has the ability to use a camera in the home to do whatever they want is scary and will drive people away from using it.

In conclusion, FACS will probably be used for specific tasks only, but it is interesting to ponder the potential for similar softwares in the future. The main problem that Dr. Huang will face is trying to show the people the trustworthiness of the product. If there is too much skepticism from the people it simply won't be found around the world and rather only in more secluded places such as labs or research facilities for testing purposes. In the future, other softwares will be created and maybe they will have the potential to impact the world in influential, innovative, and successful ways.

57AB2EB3B7B6,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents information about driverless cars. The article sheds light on both the good and bad aspects of driverless cars. The article talks about many of the topics that come with the subject of driverless cars. Some of the topics of driverless cars that made its into this article includes: safety issues, obstacles that had to be overcome during the creation of driverless cars, and laws that will clear up some of the issues that driveless cars pose. Driverless cars should be the ideal mode of transportation in the near future.

Sensors have been in use in the automotive industry to add safety to there vehicles, and this technology will help make driverless cars much more safe than human-driven vehicles. When driverless cars can completely be self-driven, they will be using many sensors to be safer than their human-driven counterparts. With completely driverless cars, there will be no more room for human errors; there will be nothing that destracts driverless cars. Google has been making semi-driverless cars which have driven more than half a million miles without a single accident. These cars use a multitude of sensors to estimate the distance of objects near them. Sensors have been in use for over 30 years in the automotive industry to improve safety. One of the most important uses of sensors was with the creation of the antilock brake. These sensors were used to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Driverless cars are going to be more eco-friendly than human-driven cars. Sergey Brin, a Google cofounder, believes that with a system of driverless vehicles, there would be 50% decrease in use of fuel. He also said that creating a public transportation system comprised of driverless vehicles would fundamentally change the world. With driverless technology, programs could easily be created to help reduce the use of fossil fuels when possible. Driverless cars in the future could perhaps shut off the engine while waiting at a railroad crossing. This is just one of the many uses that programming could help reduce the use of fossil fuels. Regenerative systems could also be put into use to reduce the use of fuel. Hybrid technology has been put into use by many manufacturers today, and could definately help driverless cars become more eco-friendly.

Driverless cars are the future of transportation as we know it. There are many positive aspects that will create a much greater society than what we have today. With it's safety features, vehicular accidents will become a thing of the past. With the fuel-saving ideas that are up-and-coming for driverless cars, the impact that we have made on our environment will hopefully be reduced. Driverless cars are going to be the new kings of the road.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,8

""What Is The Electoral College?""

Asks

The Office OF Federal Register . The Electoral College is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. The Founding Fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President.

""

Does The Electoral College Work?""

Is The Question That remains.

""What's Wrong With the electoral college""?

Electors have refused to vote for their party's candidates and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. ""This is the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster fact"". I Think The Disaster Fact is What Has the Office of the Federal Register questioning the Electoral College. Although, The System Allows For Much Worse.

The Electoral College is widely regarded an anachronism. a non-democratic way of selecting our president.

I Think The Electoral College is Unfair Because of The Winner-take-all system in each state. The Winner-takes-all system is the system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. it's basically a gamble. you come with electors, hope for the best and if your luck is good you leave with a jackpot, but sadly if you dont get the jackpot you lose all. I Agree That ""The Electoral College Is Unfair,Outdated,And Irrational.""-

states paragrah 14

Certanity of Outcome, Everyone's President, Swing States, Big States,Avoid Run-Off Elections are the ""Five resons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"", These reasons still dont give us any solutions. The five reasons arent about being fair its about what comes along with  winner-takes-all.

Senator, I think that we should change the way the voting system for the electoral college,because the winner-takes-all has barely worked over the years and now its just unfair.

This is why i think the Electoral College should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States.                                                                                    ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
9677669AA32B,"Summer is usually where I have most of my fun. I am always working, playing football, and hanging out with friends. Usually I dedicate most of my free time to things I love doing on my break, but sometimes when I have to do school related things, I like when I get to pick the summer project rather than the teacher to pick it. I think if the students get to pick the summer projects they want to do, it will probably lead to a better and more exciting project rather then a boring project which was required to do.

I think if most students get to pick the summer project they want to do, they will find their topic more interesting, therefore making the project more enjoyable. If the summer projects become more enjoyable, students would actually want to them and not forget or ignore the projects until school starts back again. Especially since students are on summer vacation, most students will not do anything school-related or even the projects, but if they do it on something they enjoy, they would likely do it instead of slacking off. Students who tend to hate school may do projects if the projects are based on something they like or something they find interesting. Most students would actually have a passion and might even enjoy the projects they get to pick to do in the summers.

I also believe the students will have more fun doing summer projects they enjoy rather than what the teacher picks for the students . Since students have more freedom and more say on what topics their summer projects will be on, I think the students would put more effort and more excitement into the summer projects. Projects that tend to be interested by the students can lead to a better projects since the students actually know the topics they like and choose those topics to do summer projects on them. Making summer projects more enjoyable could lead to students maybe liking school due to the freedom they get to pick went they choose their own summer projects instead of the teacher assigning the topics. And since the students get to pick their own topics, they will have more passion doing the projects, therefore leading to better projects and grades for the students and easier grading and less work for teachers.

Lastly I believe that if students go to pick their own summer topics for their projects, they will finish it quicker and get it over with as soon as possible instead of waiting last minute to complete the projects. Since the students get to pick their projects, they would be able to finish it in no time due to their topic being interesting and their topics being enjoyable. Since students would most likely pick a topic they enjoy, their knowledge of the topic might be big or they might do a lot of research due to they wanting to find new information out, thus helping them finish this project easier and faster than other projects. Some people think that if teachers gave out topics for summer projects it would be more educational and better, but these people are wrong because if the students got to pick out there summer project topics, they would be able to enjoy it a little more and it would be more enjoyable to the students. Also if the students got to pick their topics for their summer projects, they would probably get it done with quickly so they could be able to do a lot more activities like hanging out with people or play sports or even work and since the topic they picked was something they had interested in, they would be glad to get it over with.

In conclusion, all these reasons that were stated in this essay are good reasons on why schools should let the students pick their topics for summer projects instead of the teaching picking them out for them. Letting the students pick what topics they want to do for summer is an easier way to make the projects more exciting and better learning for the students. People should care about letting the students pick their topics because if they want to research more about a certain topic, this will allow them to able to research it more in depth and help the knowledge of the student grow more. ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

CED03E44340E,"Are you ever in that one situation where you have to make a difficult decision and you don't know which option is the right one? Seeking advice from others is one of the best ways a person can make a mindful decision. Advice from others can do this by giving different approaches to a problem, relieving stress, and prepare a person for other future choices as well as motivating others. In addition, it's entirely free!

Most people who are involved in making important decisions usually do not call on others for help and are statistically proven to make choices that they later regret. This is mainly due to the fact that people who only listen to their own advice often lack perspective. Perspective from others can help give the decision maker more options and give a clearer view of which decisions are not the best to make. To no surprise, advice from others is the best way a person can use those viewpoints to their advantage. Not only do more options open up to the decision maker but they will also have enough evidence or support to lead to their final decision. Eighty-Nine percent of people who took the advice from peers or friends and looked at a situation in a different viewpoint than their own arrived at a better decision than those who listened to only themselves. Thus, advice from others can lead to more beneficial viewpoints than the advice from one's self.

Majority of the time, the decision maker will stress more and more the longer they try to think of the best choice to make. This is especially true to adolescents when they are a few years away from adulthood. However, relieving this stress has no simpler solution than from the helpful words of fellow advisers. Those who give the advice won't usually understand the stress the decision maker is going through which is why most of the time their advice can be all the more relieving to the decision maker. Just like stress, calmness can also build up within a person which results in smarter final decisions, not the stressful and thoughtless ones. The loss of stress can also find people working more efficiently and calmly. Although, a person can feel the stress within them, they usually intend to ignore it and don't realize the negative impact it has on their decision making. Others could easily notice this and would address this with practical but relieving advice so that the decider may focus on work rather than their conflicting emotions.

Advice from others doesn't necessarily mean it's for one decision. It can be used for future ones and even inspire a decision maker to give it to another. Statistics show that ninety-one percent of those who received advice from others applied it regularly for other problems. Of those nine-one percent of people, around eighty-percent of them shared it with others. These statistics are groundbreaking and show the vast benefits multiple opinions can have on someone. Not only that but advice from others can get people out of the habit of having a closed mindset and offer them new opportunities. From the beginning advice from others has played a big role in shaping the present and will continue to do so for the future. This is only possible however, if people are willing to be less stubborn and listen to others for a change rather than only themselves.

In conclusion the points from above show that advice from other provides many benefits and opportunities which can lead to better decision making. By looking at a different perspective they can identify the most beneficial decisions. Advice from others also relieves the decision maker of the traumatizing stress that builds up within them. Finally, others' advice can help you and others make better future decisions. Remember, the greatest gift from your friends is the influence and advice they have.          ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
CA347336D930,"Praise and achievements are two important factors that contribute to the development of a student's self-esteem and confidence. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of both and how they work together to help students feel good about themselves and their abilities.

Praise is a powerful tool that can help students feel good about themselves and their accomplishments. When students receive praise for their work, they feel a sense of validation and recognition for their efforts. This can help to boost their self-esteem and confidence, as they feel like they are capable and worthy of positive feedback.

Praise can also help to motivate students to continue working hard and striving for excellence. When students know that their hard work and achievements are recognized and appreciated, they are more likely to feel a sense of purpose and direction in their studies. This can lead to increased engagement and a greater sense of fulfillment in their academic pursuits.

Achievements, on the other hand, are tangible evidence of a student's hard work and dedication. Whether it's getting good grades, earning awards or recognition, or completing challenging projects, achievements can help to build a student's confidence and self-esteem.

When students achieve something, they feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. They know that they have worked hard and that their efforts have paid off. This can help to boost their self-esteem and confidence, as they feel like they are capable of achieving great things.

Achievements can also help to motivate students to continue working hard and striving for excellence. When students see what they can accomplish with hard work and dedication, they are more likely to feel a sense of purpose and direction in their studies. This can lead to increased engagement and a greater sense of fulfillment in their academic pursuits.

In conclusion, praise and achievements are two important factors that contribute to the development of a student's self-esteem and confidence. Praise helps to validate and recognize a student's efforts, while achievements provide tangible evidence of their hard work and dedication. Both can help to boost a student's self-esteem and confidence, and motivate them to continue working hard and striving for excellence.

Hi, this is one of a student from the SCHOOL_NAME. I am writing this letter to talk about the policies our school is having. The policy that i will be talking about is the cell phone policy.

I think our school should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, but as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Because we have busy students, their parents will be calling them to inform them on what they should do. I agree, sometimes students do get carried of with their phones. But some students don't have phones, so don't think to hard about this. Students do want to text with their friends, and they can because sometimes school gets boring, but I think that instead of focusing on what to do with the phones, you should focus on what to do with the classes. The reason students text during class is because the class isn't interesting enough. What I noticed is that more people text in the ""boring"" classes then in the ""fun"" classes. You don't need to confiscate the phones, let the students keep them, but if the classes are better, then the rate of students using phones will decrease. Also if the work is to hard, students might text some answers to each other, so don't make the work to hard either. I'm just saying, its your decision. I also use phones, and I love to text, but sometimes play games or text other people when i get bored and sometimes I get texts from my friends asking me what the answers are to a problem or something like that.

Sincerely,

The SCHOOL_NAME

The law was just passed last year that is you're on your phone while driving, that is an immediate ticket. Due to your criminal record (if it's bad) you can even do jail time if you feel you do not apply to this law. The cops of our cities are doing their job by stopping people who does not follow this law.

The main reason why this show not be condoned is, because most of these situations a citizen could get in a car accident. Approximately 1.6 million citizens die due to being on their cell phone while operating a vehicle. Nearly 390,000 people get real serious injuries due to texting and driving. One out of four of every car accident in the United States are due to texting and driving. In my opinion I believe texting and driving is the main reason we have so many deaths every year.

In conclusion, texting and driving needs to be/ stay illegal. That way people will not do it so often, which could decrease the death rate each year. Texting and driving could possibly be the reason why our death rates increase over time. Especially in this day and age, because almost everything now is technology based. In addition, I believe that texting and driving is not safe for yourself or others, so technology should be the last thing you are on while behind and active vehicle. Texts, calls, emails all can wait until you are in a secure place (not behind the wheel) to respond, and also that way nobody could die or have an injury                                          ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
AD7012F5871A,"The advantages of limiting car usages is a suggestion idea about car-free cities. Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of movement called ""smart planning.'' The reazon why they are trying to expand this plan is because the use of car in the cities is growing every day like five times more than the usual. Cities are full of of car and you dont have to read these to see that. I know that these is a period of time in which tecnology is what take the first place in are life, and am talking about those new model of car. In one part of the view we can see that those care are very atractive and they dont cause any risk to society. But in the other side I will like to show you what especialist people think the cities full of cars. Experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission from tailpipes. Passenger cars are resposible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emision in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

Let see these in other point of view. Think about your son or your little brother or sisster or just tink about any little baby that is born in those cities full of cars . The greenhouse gas emission is reduced by 50 percent so the other 50 percent that those kids are breathing is just toxic air. Taths why the hospitals are full of people whit pulmonary cancers and asthma. While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. But its basic precepts are being adopted aroun the worl in attempts to make suburbs  more compact and more accessible to public transportation, whith les space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk  away, on a main steet, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Something that also affect the society is the obesity. People depend a lot on their cars and forgot about to walk. It is a simple example but it had cause a lot of death and heart attac in the past two decades.

I hope this essay help you to understand and realized about all risk that cars can cause includind cars accident. The limit car usage will help every body starting with those who accept the Environmental Protection Agency promotion ''car reduced''.

While there are arguments on both sides of this issue, I believe that the Electoral College system has served our nation well for over two centuries and should be maintained.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard Posner in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system ensures that even a slight plurality in a state can result in a landslide electoral-vote victory. While it is not impossible for a tie in the nationwide electoral vote to occur, it is highly unlikely. This certainty helps provide stability and legitimacy to the election process.

Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures every region of the country is taken into account during the election. With the need to appeal to a wide range of states, candidates are encouraged to campaign in different regions and address the concerns and interests of voters across the nation. This helps prevent a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president and ensures that the interests of all regions are considered. As Judge Posner points out, this is crucial for maintaining a united and representative federal government.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These states, where the outcome is less predictable, receive the most attention and the most thoughtful voters. This ensures that the decision of the election is made by those who have closely evaluated the candidates and their policies. By focusing on swing states, candidates are encouraged to address the needs and concerns of a diverse range of voters, resulting in a more balanced and representative election process.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a balance of power between large and small states. As Judge Posner notes, large states receive more attention from presidential candidates due to the additional electoral votes they have. This helps to counterbalance the mal-apportionment of the Senate, where small states have an equal number of senators despite having smaller populations. This ensures that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account during the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This avoids the complications and costs associated with organizing and conducting additional elections. Instead, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, ensuring a smooth transition of power and stability in our democracy.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as the belief that it is unfair to voters and encourages candidates to focus on swing states only, I believe that the advantages of this system outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College provides certainty, encourages a trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances power between large and small states, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained as the method of selecting the President of the United States. Its ability to provide certainty, consider the interests of different regions, encourage candidates to campaign widely, balance power between large and small states, and prevent run-off elections make it a valuable and necessary part of our democratic process. I urge you to consider these arguments and support the continuation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

- but the one thing that every child deserves is the chance to receive a quality education. People across the globe have fought for this vital opportunity for decades, advocating for those whose path to knowledge is obscured by circumstance. Students who have obstacles such as mental health issues or the lack of local education would greatly benefit and be better accommodated from the opportunity to take classes online and from their home.

A system of at-home classwork would greatly help any student with a learning disability or intellectual setback. Many children struggle with slight disabilities such as dyslexia or ADHD - small occurrences that hinder the learning process. However, these minuscule variations can have major effects on the way a student absorbs information and needs to be accommodated in the classroom, a setback that many public schools aren't equipped to handle. This can prove detrimental to the development of the student - without the proper instruction formatted for the style in which they learn, their true academic potential can remain untapped. With classes taken inside the home, this can change. In the environment they know best, surrounded by people that understand how they need to be aided, the child can thrive without the pressure to adapt to the method of learning endorsed inside the mainstream school. They can explore options in their education and take the time they need to properly understand new concepts, all within their home and without the restraint of a larger public entity telling them to conform.

Students that don't have access to public education in the areas in which they live would highly benefit from the ability to take online classes. While a rarity, there are some areas of the globe where young people are denied the chance to receive an education. This is nearly never the fault of the student - where they live, the government of the country that they live in, and their gender or physical appearance are all traits that they cannot control. When the terrorist group Al-Qaeda was present in Pakistan, many Pakistani girls couldn't go to school or leave their houses due to the militia's belief that women were not deserving of rights or an education. While these girls were being denied the opportunity to be educated, this doesn't mean that they weren't deserving - online classes could've and still could improve that situation. Through the availability of methods to access classwork in the home, children that have been circumstantially denied the chance to attend school could be granted that chance again, and with potentially less risk. Classes taken within the home would allow students in difficult life situations to gain back their opportunity to learn, and continue furthering their intellectual development despite their circumstances.

Anxiety can severely stunt the educational career of a budding child, but would be lessened through the attendance of classes from home. Anxiety can infiltrate every corner of a student's thought process, and whether the stress is academically related or not, it affects the way that a child learns and grows. Participation grades, group projects, popularity expectations, and the rumor mill of regular public school can take a more severe toll on children with anxiety disorders, making it hard for these students to see school as a place to gain knowledge. Instead, they begin to dread it, sick and tired of the constant pressure and nervousness they experience in the classroom. However, when attending classes within the home, these judgments can be alleviated. The anxiety within the student is eased by being in a familiar environment, a place where they can decide what interactions to engage in and when. An opportunity like at-home classes can transform an anxious child's perspective of education from a negative and stressful experience into something positive and beneficial, helping them progress academically while accommodating to their mental health.

The opportunity to receive at-home education and attend classes through an online program would provide important accommodations to students that otherwise feel out-of-place in the regular public school system, namely those with mental setbacks or difficult geographical circumstances. While it is a privilege and would most likely take time to implement, the chance for a personalized education is a chance that all children deserve. ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

This contrasts with feeling depressed and giving up after a failed attempt, which leads to a discouraging cycle that ultimately prevents success. One book that addresses this topic in great depth is ""The Life of an Indian"" by Bhagat Singh Rajput.

Retain the Electoral College. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electors is is required to slect the President. Each state has his/her own electors which are chosen by the candidate political party. You should keep the Electoral College because you have certainty of outcome, and the President is everyones not just yours.

The first reason why you should stay with the Electoral College is because you are certain that the outcome will be in favor of one of the candidates. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote may happen but it is very unlikely that it will even though that 538(number of electors in the Electoral College) is a even number(S.3).For example in 2012's election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to 51.3 percent of the popular cast for him and Romney because all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state(S.3).  However,because of the winner-take-all system in each state,candidates dont spend time in staes they know they have no chance of winning, they only focus on the close,tight races in the ""swing""states(S.2). But, the winning candidates share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

The second reason you should keep the Electoral College is because the president is everyone's. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president by themselves. So for example,a solid regional favorite,such as Romney was in the South,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states he knows for sure that he will win(S.3).A president with only his regional apppeal is very unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions may feel like there votes dont count or that he really isnt there president.

In conclusion, you should stay with the Electoral College simply because you most likely not going to have a tie and because the president is everyone's.     ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
F9A944AD1FD2,"Not Using Phones in a Vehicle

Crashes, getting pulled over, and not paying attention to the road- nobody likes those things, well, most of it comes from cellphones. Operating cellphones on the road is not good for you.

Crashes are one of the main causes of death today. The Zebra states that ""Nearly nine people die and 1,000 are injured from car accidents daily where one is distracted by a phone."" This implies that most accidents are caused by someone operating cellphones on the road, which shows you how much people stay on their phone in the car and why it is not good for you. In summary of this paragraph driving while on the phone is not good for you.

Getting pulled over by the cops because of being on your phone while driving happens a lot. While people are in real situations you are getting pulled over by a cop because of a cellphone. The Seattle Times said that ""Individuals are getting fined $136 for a first ticket and

$234 for additional tickets."" This shows that if you get pulled over for being on your phone you will be fined for it. In other words it is another example why not to be on your phone while driving.

Not paying attention to the road is mainly caused by a cellphone. Most people when on phones in a car are not paying attention to the road which means they could hit someone or something, hit another car, or run off the road. On Wikipedia they say that ""Drivers are distracted, decreasing the drivers awareness on the road."" This confirms that driving and using a phone causes people to not pay attention to the road. Therefore, operating cellphones on the road is not good for you.

In conclusion to this essay, I explain how driving and operating a phone is not good for you. You could also help by turning off or silencing your phone when you enter the car and drive safely. It could lead to less crashes, less tickets, and a safer drive.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

The principle should banned student from using phones during school is in session until the principle sees the students test scores are getting higher up. Not allowing student to use their phone during school is a great idea because now students are going to be more focused on school studies then just spending their time on their phone. Phones are a great invention but I think it would be better to keep them out of schools for the students education. Most parent's of students would probably agree with me. I consider phones distractions inside of a school campus. If I were to go to school and offer a student a phone, or an education the student would most likely choose the phone. My opinion is that the most important thing a student should get is a education, but if they cant get it because a phone is more important to them then i think that is just sad.

Subject: The Importance of Maintaining the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College, as I firmly believe that it is a crucial and valuable system that should be upheld in the election process for the President of the United States. While there may be arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I contend that the Electoral College offers several significant benefits that outweigh its drawbacks.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, making it highly unlikely to result in a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. This guarantees a more stable and predictable outcome, avoiding prolonged legal battles that would only undermine the integrity of our democracy.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes the principles of representative democracy. By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the system ensures that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This encourages candidates to campaign across the nation rather than focusing solely on the densely populated areas. Consequently, all regions and their respective interests receive attention and consideration, preventing any sense of disenfranchisement among voters. Judge Posner rightly argues that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Therefore, the Electoral College safeguards against the potential exclusion of certain regions in the decision-making process.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes benefits swing states and encourages more thoughtful participation from voters. Swing states attract the most campaign efforts due to the importance of their electoral votes, prompting candidates to engage more deeply with their citizens. This heightened attention results in greater access to information, more extensive debates, and ultimately, more informed voters. The Electoral College incentivizes candidates to listen to the concerns of the swing states, ensuring that the most thoughtful voters have the power to decide the election outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances power between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, which grants each state an equal number of seats, often disadvantages larger states in other aspects of governance. However, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance by giving larger states more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. It provides a fair representation of diverse interests across states, fosters inclusivity, and prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College ensures a clear winner. This avoids complications and delays in the election process, allowing for a smooth and efficient transition of power.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voting in ""safe"" states, the fact remains that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences rather than with the expectation of wielding decisive power. Thus, the possibility of not carrying one's state should not discourage voter engagement, as evidenced by the significant turnout in past elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an essential component of our democratic system that serves to protect and uphold the principles of representative democracy. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, prevents regional exclusion, encourages thoughtful voter participation, balances power between states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While some may argue for a popular vote system, the Electoral College remains a vital safeguard that ensures fairness and stability in our electoral process. I urge you to consider these points and continue supporting the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

However, sometimes it can be challenging to find someone who truly understands what you are going through and can provide helpful advice. In these situations, it may be necessary to seek out multiple perspectives and try different approaches to find the best solution.

It is important to recognize that not all advice is created equal. Some people may simply be trying to get attention or may not have the experience or knowledge to provide meaningful guidance. In these cases, it may be helpful to seek out someone who has been through similar experiences or who has expertise in the area you are seeking advice on.

One approach to finding good advice is to seek out multiple perspectives and compare the advice you receive. This can help you to identify which advice is most relevant and helpful to your specific situation. Additionally, it can be helpful to seek out advice from people who have different backgrounds and experiences, as they may bring unique insights and perspectives to the table.

Ultimately, the key to finding good advice is to be open-minded and willing to consider different options. By seeking out multiple perspectives and trying different approaches, you can increase your chances of finding the advice and support you need to navigate difficult times and make informed decisions.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

Do you have a cell phone? It is nice to have, isn't it? You can do so many things with your cell phone like getting on the internet, getting in touch with friends, or keeping track of stuff. Well all these things could help during school. I'm not saying you should let us have it out during class, but in between class periods or during lunch. It would be a big help to us and you. By that I mean our education.

If you allowed us to take our phones out in between classes, we cold swiftly study for a quiz or exam we had in an upcoming period. This would help you in our school test score rating overall.

When we are in school for so long, we students tend to get bored and so we start talking then the teacher gets mad because we are to loud or we are talking while he/she is talking. A way to prevent that is to let us have our phones out during lunch so we can talk to our friends. You might say we get to talk to our friends all the time. I'm talking about the people we don't sit with at lunch cause ya'll don't let us sit any where we want. So we could text or talk to the people across the lunch room.

In our phones we have note pads, calendars, calculators, and other stuff we could use for school. we could keep up with notes taken in class or set an alarm for a day we have test.

68201A571AE4,"During the summer leading up to my eighth grade year, my mom suggested that I get involved in an extracurricular activity because they are very beneficial for kids.

I thought for a while, then took her advice and decided to play on my high school's junior varsity football team.

When the practices first started that July, things were running pretty smoothly;however, once the school year started a couple of weeks later, things got a quite a lot tougher.

I had to learn to be responsible in order to keep up with my homework every day after practice.

As the season went on, I learned a lot of stuff about football and school, but most importantly, I had lots of fun doing it.

I am so glad that I took my mom's advice about extracurricular activities being beneficial to kids because I found that to be true for me as well.

Consequently, I agree with the decision that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

First, I think all students should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches students new, real world skills.

There are countless numbers of valuable techniques in the world today that are never taught within a classroom, but are needed for a successful career.

For example, when I played football, I learned the importance of working together on a team with other people.

When we all learned to work as one team, we started to play really good and win games.

On the other hand, if someone goes all throughout school and never learns the skill of teamwork, it is likely that they will not be very successful when they enter the real world because teamwork is an important skill that is needed in almost every job.

Just imagine if you are a business owner or employer and are looking for a person that you can hire to work for you.

Would you choose the person who was never involved in any type of after school or extracurricular activity, or would you choose the person who was very productive and was involved in many different activities throughout their schooling?

You would probably choose the one who was very involved in their school because that shows you that they have the skills needed to work for you and can keep up with a job.

Secondly, everyone should be involved in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them how to be responsible with their work.

Most kids today don't want to do their homework, and instead only do the fun stuff like play on their phones or lay on the couch like a sleeping bear, which usually results in bad grades.

However, being involved in an activity teaches students that if they want to have fun and stay in their club, they must do their work before anything else.

For example, during football season, I had to be extremely responsible with my schoolwork and grades, or else my coach could have kicked me off of the team.

Similarly, being responsible can also be a key characteristic of getting into college or the workforce.

Just like how you have a low chance of getting hired if you don't have the skills, you have an even lower chance of getting a job if you can't be responsible and maintain your job very well.

Some of the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the most talented or have the most skills, but they are able to keep up with all their work and maintain their position.

Lastly, extracurricular activities teach students how to have fun while doing something productive.

As mentioned earlier, students these days only like to do the fun stuff, not the work.

Extracurricular activities give kids the chance to have loads of fun, but also learn valuable lessons.

As a result of the activities being fun, students will also be more likely to stay in their club because they enjoy it, which helps both the students and the teachers get along better.

Additionally, most students will go away from a class and only remember the fun things that they did in it, while they will forget about all the important stuff.

But in extracurricular classes, the fun parts of the class will usually directly relate to profitable skills or morals, so that when students remember the fun stuff, they will also remember the skills that they learned as well.

For example, one day during football practice, our coach had us do a fun drill where we got to run behind our blockers.

I vividly remember this because it was really exciting when I got to do it, although, when I think about it, I also remember that in order to do it, I had to get low and run with the proper technique.

It was because of fun things like that drill that I was able to stick with the game and improve my skills.

So as you can see, I agree with the decision that all kids should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

Just like how I had to alter my work schedule when I played football, extracurricular activities might not be that easy, but I can promise you that in the long run, they are worth participating in.

So even if you don't think extracurricular activities are good for you, go ahead and just give one a try.

There are all sorts of activities out there that are available to everyone, so all you need to do is find the one that strikes your fancy.

I guarantee that you will not regret it at all!",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Since Venus is one of the closest to us, He claims that it is one of the easier planets to explore.

160C1321A536,"Dear Principle,

I think that your consideration of changing the school policy is completely unfair to the students, teachers, and coaches here at our school. For many students, maintaining a grade B average is almost impossible. If most students have a grade C average, don't you think that if would be most logical to set the standard at a grade C? I do understand that academics come first and i respect that, but i also feel that many students may not feel a need to keep their average at a grade C because without sport eligibility, there is no need to. There is also the issue of coaches losing their jobs because there are not enough children to play that sport. As for the students that can maintain a grade B average, this policy change could also effect them negatively as well. Without enough children to play on a team, those who have at least a grade B average will not be able to play either because there may not be enough of these students to create a full team. Also, clubs and extracurricular activities may have to be cancelled because of the lack of eligible participants. It is very good for students to be able to experience things outside of academics. With this new policy, many students will not have that experience available to them. Please take all of these examples into consideration when making your final decision.

Thanks.

6D06DAD5446C,"I agree that people should get the help, so they can make great decisions. Because the other person could probably be wrong with somethings. Also the other person doesn't have any saying in your life, if you don't want them to. And you are the only person who can change the outcome of your life. even so your the main person in your life, its okay to hear others out even though they are wrong sometimes or if they are sometimes right.

The first reason is that its okay if you don't want the other person's help. But you should hear them out so you can get something out of thing. For example my friend Generic_Name, she love to write stories and love to sing, and dance, but she too embarrassed to do what she love. So one day I gave her some ideas, but she didn't want any, because she don't want to do them, but next day, she gave some of my ideas a try and she like it but still don't want to do it anymore. But long as she listened that good enough for me.

The second reason is people don't have any saying in your life, yes its true, but theres people willing to help you through your life. But it only depend on you, if you want their help or not. For a example my sister Generic_Name doesn't want help from me nor our parents.

Longs she lets us in her life, thats good enough for us.

Last reason is you still are the main person in your life, so no matter what you do your life, just remember it your life is your alone, and you are the only one who can change the outcome of your future. even If you want the help of others or not.

9CE077EDCC85,"The reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington quote . First this is a good quote for students who are always working hard and make a lot of mistakes because they get motivated from this quote. This quote can make someones day better .

First reason is there a lot of people in the world who has a lot of problems. so I think that this quote would light up there day and make them fell better. second reason is that people that dose not have any problems could save this quote in there brains and when they are facing a problem they could use it to help them through that time and to do better. lastly I think when Duke Ellington was going through trough times he used his own straghe to help him to do his best and not give up.

Next reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington is that when people have a lot of problems most of them just give up for example most people dose not have enough money to pay there bills some sell their house while others sell the cars and most people become homeless and live in the streets but if the hear this quote it might help them not to give up and do there best.

My final reason why everyone should agree with Duke Ellington quote is it's hard going through a problem because any thing can happen some people lose there jobs because of a problem.

B5AA232A7261,"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about this thing where schools want us to pick our career by the time we're in high school. Like, I get it, it's cool to have a plan and all, but I think it's kinda stressful. I mean, what if we change our minds like, a million times? Or what if we're just not sure what we want to do yet? It's like, shouldn't we be allowed to explore and figure it out at our own pace?

So, I did some research and found out that some people who took nontraditional paths after high school ended up being super successful. Like, did you know that Mark Zuckerberg didn't even finish college? And he's like, a billionaire or something! Or that J.K. Rowling was a single mom on welfare before she became a bestselling author. Like, whoa. So, maybe it's not such a bad thing to take a little time to figure things out.

But, on the other hand, some people say that picking a career by high school can help us get into college and stuff. And it's like, I get that, but shouldn't we be allowed to explore our interests and passions first? I mean, what if we're good at something that's not even on the career ladder? Like, what if I'm really good at playing video games and I want to be a pro gamer? Should I just give up on that because it's not a ""real"" career?

I don't know, guys. I'm just not sure what to think. But, I do know that I don't want to be forced into something that I'm not sure about. Can't we just take a deep breath and figure it out together? Like, as a society or something?

So, that's my essay. I hope you guys liked it. Let me know what you think! 😃",1,llama2_chat,Task: Research the negative consequences of requiring students to identify a career by the time they enter high school.

The first reason we shoud not change the way we have done it is because its easier to maintain there is a system of ways to keep it running smothly , an example of how its runnyimg smothly ""...the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast...there is no pressure pressure for off run elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes cast...that pressure ,which whould gratly complicacate the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college , which invariably produces a clear winner..."".[in source 3:in defences of the electoral college]

The second reason is how it has worked nicely for all of these years why change now. it says in source 1 what is electoral college that "" ... the founding fathers had established it in the consitution as a compromisre between elections of the president by vote"" this states that it has been around for years and still today in 2014 is still going strong why would u want to risk something that is going so well. another example comes from [source 1:what is the electoral college] ""under the 23 amendment of the constitution ,the distrect of columbia is allocated 3 electors like a state for purpusoses of the electoral college."" this proves it has ben around since the consitution was mad.

On the other hand the only down side is that each slate electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee that trust is barley bettrayed,but it has happened before in""... 2000 when gore had more popular votes then bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.."".

75AA6229A116,"The renowned British statesman Winston Churchill once famously said that “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” His words express a powerful idea: that failure is essential for success. This notion is particularly relevant in our modern lives, where every day we set ourselves goals and strive for success in all aspects of our lives. In order for us to reach our goals, it is inevitable that we will experience failure along the way. This should be embraced, rather than feared, as failure often gives us insight and teaches us valuable lessons. We should use this knowledge to help power us towards our ultimate goals. 

The key to maintaining enthusiasm throughout this process is to remain optimistic and focus on our progress. With each failure, we gain more experience and knowledge which can be used on our journey to success. Viewing failure in a positive light allows us to stay motivated and benefit from the lessons learned. Having a strong mindset and the right attitude can be the difference between succeeding and throwing in the towel. 

Winston Churchill’s quote encapsulates the idea that it is possible to utilize failure to propel us towards our desired outcomes. By keeping our enthusiasm alive and staying optimistic, we set ourselves up for achieving our greatest successes.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Investigate the idea that failure is essential for success, as expressed by the quote by Winston Churchill: ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

669e6f61,"How could we get the reduction of Greenhouse Gas? We can simply do this by reducing the number of cars on the road. In the city of Vauban, Germany, they gave up cars completely. If you still own a car in this city you have to buy a large garage that runs to about 40,000. This expense doesn't include your house. Up to 70% of the cities population of 5,500 have given up their motor vehicle. The passenger cars in the city are responsible for 12% of the Greenhouse gas. I believe that if we, in the state of Florida, give up our cars that we can literally save the world.

First, Today in the sunshine state, we love to sit in our air conditioned motor vehicles. We love to take a joy ride by the beach, but do you know the real damage you're doing to our world? In the United States alone we produce about 50% of the greenhouse gas. With how many citizens we have, what would that number be if we cut out all motor vehicles? We would be saving the Earth. How does that make you feel? Like a hero? That's what you would be.

Secondly, We all own houses that cost so much! To be able to park your car you could have to buy a large enough garage, that would be at the end of your country that could cost up to 40,000. Why pay this outrageous amount to be the only one driving around your carfree city? If we do take this commitment on reducing our driving, how would you get to work? This is a common question asked. We would be forced to put work establishments within walking distances.

Lastly, we as americans are one of the most obese countries. We sit in cars and drive around daily. Our government has actually made it even more easy to access fast food, they put in drive threws. Some thought that this awesome, new, cool invention could help us save time, but in reality it just make it more simple to get these bad habits. If we really want to eat these bad foods, we would have to walk there. Thus we would be getting more exercise. Getting rid of cars would be the best thing that has happened to us in a long time.

In conclusion, We need to take a stand and stop all motor vehicles. With these powered automobiles we are damaging the earth with Greenhouse gas, Saving money, and giving us what we need. I believe that this change needs to be made soon, or who knows where we could end up. Lets get all states to get rid of all motor vehicles.",0,train_essays,,3
D06C46698557,"My postition on drivless cars is that i personaly dont like the idea because what happens if one of the driveless cars mess up or glitch while on a busy highway or just on a regular road and someone gets hurt whos to blame the comapany that made the car I would feel more safe if i was in control of the car not only because I could control it if I messed up butt if someone else messed up also I could steer out of the way.

Also what if you wanted to go offroad with it and you cant becasue the car is not programed for off road so it would take the fun out of driving I think. Another reason i dont like it is that so far on the driverless cars is that the speed isnt very high as of now and if your wanting to get somewhere as fast as possible the fastest your driverless car can go is up to 25 mph and that wont get you anywhere fast. Another reason is what happens when new roads are made not everyone is going to want to update thier car just so new roads can be programed into it so it knows where to turn at and how fast it should go on the new roads. Also what if a person is walking and desideds to jump out in front of you and run to the other side of the road or there are animals on the side of the road and the car dosen't see it so it dosent know to slow down and make sure nothing is gettting ready to jump and run across the road.

So the only way I would think a driverless car would be a good idea would be if it also let you take control at any moment you wanted not just when the car needed help incase of construction work; also if the people making these driverless cars took full responability for wrecks caused by their cars and if they could possibly make them faster and made them very, very safe.

C2DCF6EED519,"After school programs have become increasingly popular within the last decade, offering students the chance to extend the content they have learnt during the day, or to pursue a passion, such as creative writing or coding. By researching near my area, I have found a plethora of after school programs, ranging from extracurricular activities such as photography and art, to more academic lectures such as coding and essay writing. When comparing the different programs, there are certain factors I had to look at, such as their cost, content and duration.

I have researched many success stories of students who have participated in after school programs and have seen great improvement in their academic work and development of important life skills such as communication and problem-solving. 

The advantages of after school programs are plentiful. They can offer students the chance to pursue their passions, as well as to expand beyond the content taught in school, which can lead to better academic performance and career advantages in the future. They can also be beneficial for social development, as they provide the opportunity to make connections with like-minded peers in the same field.

On the other hand, there are also disadvantages to after school programs such as the possibility of overscheduling.

D250DB9080E0," I agree with the statement that first impressions are not easy to change as many people expect. In my experience, first impressions are deeply ingrained in our personalities and are often shaped by our past experiences. While it is possible to change our first impressions, it is not always easy and may require significant effort and time.

First impressions are important because they help us to understand how a person is and what their intentions may be. It is important to remember that first impressions are not always accurate, and that it is important to take the time to get to know someone before forming a final opinion. It is also important to be aware of our own biases and assumptions that may be influencing our first impressions.

In conclusion, while first impressions are important, they should not be the sole basis for forming an opinion about someone. It is important to be patient and open-minded when trying to understand others, and to be aware of our own biases and assumptions. By doing so, we can form more accurate and meaningful connections with others.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

A0181C244D0D,"On the matter of ""driverless cars"", I would advocate for their developement. These cars are the technology of the future. They are bringing this civilization closer and closer to a new level of technological advancement. This advancement would not only create a mammoth break through in modern day technology, but would also change the way we live our day to day lives as a worldwide culture. Despite this product being a bit more of a want than a necessity for the time being, I believe that they should continue to be improved and developed.

Driverless cars have been the seemingly unattainable, next level of fantastic futuristic technology for many people for decades now. In the 1950s, General Motors created the first car that could drive without a human at the wheel. AT that time, it would have been difficult to believe that such technology of a car that could drive itself with no type of polarized track below it would have been possible. Three decades later in the 1980s, the first speed sensors had been placed in wheels in order to provide drivers with an heightened break accuracy. Not even ten years later, those same sensors had become so advanced as to now provide drivers with the added safety of a car who could respond to the danger of out-of-control skidding. Furthermore, by the 2000s, radars that at one point had costed millions, could be found in your regular old run-of-the-mill car for your local dealer ship, ready for the purchase of any regular civillian. WIth all of this improvement in a car's safety and reliability, not only can countless lives be saved on the road with this technology, but the more it is improved upon, the less room there is for the common human error in driving, which unfortunately leads to thousands of lives being lost yearly to traffic accidents. While the current ""driverless"" cars still require some human skills when travelling through complex road conditions, with continuing developement, eventually the accuracy of the computers' driving skills will rival that of human intelligence. This can be predicted by looking at the accuracy and speed of reaction when looking at an automated calculator in comparison to a human arithmatic. As time has progress, so has technology up to the point where it surpasses human intelligence and reaction speed, and in the case of these new cars, would make it generally safer for the extremely accurate computers to do the driving, rather than humans, who would make a great many more faults when it comes to driving safely and accurately. The only major issue that could arise is the problematic moment in which a ""driverless"" car's system would break. This would leave not only the passenger in the car in danger depending on the severity of the car failure, but it would also leave the other communters on the road in danger as well.

In conclusion, if these ""driverless"" cars are allowed to continue to be tested and improved upon, countless lives will be saved and human efficiency will increase. As this fantastic technology is improved upon, the negative aspects of trial and error, restrictive laws, and cost will only decrease. As for the future, human culture as we know it will change to alot this new technological enhancement into our everday lives, and in the process, potentially save thousands of individuals with ever purchase of a new ""smart"" car.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
88006889B561,"First impressions are not ""almost impossible to change"". They can be difficult to change, but they aren't almost impossible to change because there are ways that can help you change your first impression. A thing about first impression is to question yourself on is ""how can I change my own first impression?""

A lot of people say it's almost impossible to change your own first impression, but what they don't realize is that they aren't thinking hard enough to comprehend to understand why they aren't almost impossible to change, so they instead just don't even try and use more of their cognitive ability. What's important about first impressions is having to say something that will impress others.

When you use more of your cognitive ability, then you'll be able to come up with better first impressions. Once you're able to come up with a better first impression; you'll find it easier easier than what other people said based on their opinion. In conclusion, first impressions are a lot easier to change when you think about how you'll change your first impression and when you come up with a better one, but it takes time to develop

Working with a group have more benefits then woking alone becuase if you have a big project to do and your teacher allows you to work as an group but you choose not to join any group and decide to work alone so this will be hard for you to complete the project on time and the people who join the group can easily complete the project before you because they can help each other this is the biggiest benefit of working with a group.

In group work all the members of the group have to do equal work and this way they can do their part of the project very easily and if they work alone they are not abel to work that well because they have no one else to gave them advice or any kind of help therefore group work is always benefit.

EA57C6750829,"""You were wrong!"" Generic_Name said. ""Picking the gas car was not the best idea."" The sister then replied with, ""electric cars cost too much, I was just making sure you spent your money well."" That's when Generic_Name realized that he should've asked for others advise, not just only her sister. ""If only I asked others opinions on it,"" Generic_Name said. ""Well you didn't which means your stuck with this car,"" the sister replied. ""I guess you're right,"" Generic_Name said with a disappointed look. This dialouge can tell us why it's such a bad idea to only get one individuals opinion or advise. I think that asking more people for advise can help because they would have more choices to pick from, not make the wrong choice and be able to compare the choices with eachother.

First of all, asking more people for advise can help an individual make the better choice because they would have more choices to pick from, rather than just one. For instance, I wanted to buy a pair of sneakers and when I asked a friend, he only named one. So, I went on and didn't ask anyone else because I thought it was the right choice to make. After a couple of days I bought the shoes, I started to not like them because they looked too big on me. My friend himself said they were too. This was obviously the wrong choice because I didn't like them, and the reason I chose this, is because I didn't have any other choices that I could pick from. If I had asked other people, then maybe I would have made the right choice, or the choice I was happy with. It's is a good idea to have more choices than to pick from than just be stuck with one. Heres another example. My friend wanted to buy a phone but didn't know what phone was good and which was bad. He asked one of his relatives for an opinion and they told him which one to buy. After a couple days of using the phone, it started glitching out. He was furious with his choice. If he had come up to me or some other people, he might've been more happy with his choice. These stories clearly state why it's a good idea to ask more people for advise.

Moving on, having more people give you advise is a good idea because it would help you not make the wrong choice. Making the wrong choice could happen if only asking just a couple of people. For example, my uncle wanted to buy a house, so he asked his family and friends on whcih house to buy. He showed some pictures and they either said it's a good idea or it's a bad idea. Most of them said yes to one of the houses so he decided to buy that one. After a couple of months later, the other houses dropped more than half the price they originally were. If he had picked any other house, he would've been very unhappy. Asking for more people's advise helped him not make the wrong choice in the process of buying a house. This is why it's a good idea to ask more people for advise rather than just a little group of 3 or 4.

Finally, asking for more advise can help compare them with eachother. Lets say you ask for advise on if you should be friends with someone. Someone says yes, and someone says no. They both give reasons on why they said so. You have to compare the reasoning behind them to make the better choice. For example, I asked a couple of friends if I should buy a game or not. Two of them said yes and two of them said no. I then asked them for reasons and they told me all the reasons why I should either buy it or not. After hearing the reasons behind the choice, it was easier for me to make the right choice of not buying the game. I'm very happy that I compared the choices because that game was taken down for various copyrights. So even if I bought it, I wouldn't have been able to play it. Comparing the choices helped me make the better choice. If I just went with my gut and bought it, it would've turned to be a very bad idea.

""I love my new console!"" he shouted excitedly. ""Who told you it was a good idea to buy it?"" asked his father. ""Some of my friends said it was a good idea, but a couple of them said it wasn't so I went with the majority,"" he replied. ""It was a very hard choice to make but a lot of them said I should buy it."" The father happily told him that it was a good idea that he asked more people because it helped him compare the choices, not make the wrong decision and that he had more options to choose from. The kid was very happy with his choice because of these reasons. According to this example or dialouge, you could tell that it was a better idea to ask more people for advise because you would have more choices to pick from, not make the wrong choice and to be able to compare choices rather than just having one to be stuck with.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

They help create a sense of unity and equality among students, and can also help reduce distractions in the classroom. For example, if students were allowed to wear whatever they wanted, some might wear very revealing or provocative clothing, which could distract from the learning environment. Dress codes also help promote a sense of professionalism and respect for the school and its community.

On the other hand, some people might argue that dress codes are too restrictive and limit students' ability to express themselves. However, I believe that there are ways to create a dress code that still allows for personal expression while maintaining a level of professionalism. For example, allowing students to wear a certain amount of personal items, such as a favorite hat or scarf, can still promote individuality while keeping the focus on learning.

Additionally, dress codes can also help to eliminate bullying based on clothing choices. If everyone is dressed in a similar manner, it eliminates the possibility of comparing clothing brands or styles, which can be a source of bullying.

In conclusion, I believe that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment because they promote unity, equality, professionalism, and respect, while also reducing distractions and eliminating bullying. By implementing a dress code, schools can create a positive and productive learning environment for all students.",1,llama_70b_v1,Many schools have implemented a dress code to create a positive learning environment.

9306D72EC3E7,"I believe that the grade average for doing sports and after school activites should be changed to a B average for many reasons. If students do not do well in class, why should they be allowed to play sports and other activities when school work in more important. In other cases, I enjoy doing sports and such, but sometimes slip into a C average and need to bring my grad back up. Sports and after school actives are fun and helps students make new friends with the same interests and the activities students can join are enjoyable to the all kids who join them. Sports are good endurance builders, are good exercise can help some kids from becoming obese. There are many reasons why they are good for students.

Even though there are many good things about after school sports and activities, kids need to go to school and get an education. Getting an education helps a person become more well rounded and lets them experience new things that will help them later in life. Almost any job has math to do with it and you need math to understand bills, taxes and other things. sscience is every where in so many jobs, including sports and being a hair dresser. People need to learn things in order to succeed in life, that's why we have schools. Going to school also helps a interact with other people and improve people skills. Its important to know things to live a good life.

There is one thing I think is important for everyone think of before choosing to do, or not do, after school sports and actives, do you benefit from it? The answer is yes, you do. If your doing a sport or activity, you are doing what you love, and who does not want good grades? It makes your parents happy, you teachers happy, and it feels good to be a smart person. Doing both is good for you and will help you later in life. Having good grades and doing sports is a good way to get scholarships for good collages.

6B4F7A0165B9,"Cell Phone Operation While Driving

The ability to stay connected to people we know despite distance was originally brought to fruition by the use of letters. This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram; the people thought it was an invention of the millennia, but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today, a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However, this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous.

Within a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone, with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one, it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law, but taken as a more serious offense.

Conversely people may believe that laws in present need to change, becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish, when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe.

The creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

It can really do wonders to peoples lives in the future such as going out easier being safe and more efficient. But you still need a driver's license if you want to drive a smart car because when there is a something major going on the car can't sense what other people are going to do. I really think it can do good in the future with the more advance sensors on the cars and we may have better technology. I think it can do real good in this world like herlping people that can be hurt or in pain.

In paragraph 5 and 7 they have great detail of how it will help advance more in the future. In paragraph 7 they said,""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" They are not fully there yet on the selfless driving subject but they will be soon because in paragraph 5 has detail on that because it said,""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect amd respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from thr sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a humman driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" It will be advanced in the future.

I really hope one day it will happen because we are damaging the plant by using the cars we are using now. It will damage the future for our children and future generations by doing what we are doing we need stop it because we don't want to have future generation clean up what we already can clean up now.

Everywhere you go what do you see, you see your everyday family walking around with smartphones, or a businessman on a call for a meeting with a phone, but why do people do that while driving. All across the nation people everyday are using their cell phones while driving and causing more traffic collisions in the past decade or so then compared to drunk driving accidents. People should not be using a cell phone while driving because its a major distraction for the driver and can cause someone to get hurt or even killed. If today, you walked into a normal public high school and go into a class, you would see a lot of students sitting bored and playing on sometime of phone or device. Now imagine that person doing the same thing when driving, hard to imagine but a lot of the accidents that occur when people or using a cell phone is caused by teenagers and young adults.

Many states such as Georgia in the U.S. have implemented a law which requires its people to drive hands free which means if you are caught driving with a phone in hand, you will be punished with a hefty fine or jail time. A study was set in place to determine the rate of increase on cell phone related crashes each year and the number is a shocking 1.6 Million crashes and of that, 390,000 are either injured or killed. Cell phone related crashes are the number one causes of death inside the U.S's borders for the past 10 years and needs to be solved fast. The best way to regulate and control this dilemma is by implementing a law similar to Georgia's hands free law to every state to ensure that no one will drive and use a cell phone.

The only instance to which a person should be using a cell phone while driving should be by law enforcement or if you are a passenger in the vehicle. The driver needs to focus on the road at all times to ensure that his/her passengers or even just him/herself arrives to their destination on time. Even when a driver is not using a cell phone, they are still distracted by a passenger even when they are trying to show the driver something on another phone and cause an accident. The driver has only one job and is to keep all souls in a vehicle safe and secure at all times and should not be distracted.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

Playing in sport is also a very good way to stay in shape. Some people are new to a school and don't have very many friends and sport can do that for them.

9000217714BE,"In recent years, public school systems have been forced to make difficult decisions regarding the budget allocated to school sports teams. In order to maximize the impact of available resources, many schools are turning to a potential new policy that would provide equal access for all students who wish to participate in sports programs, while recognizing that not all students are competitive athletes.

From the student perspective, the new policy would be advantageous in that it could potentially provide more opportunities to develop communication and teamwork skills, while also teaching the value of healthy competition. Additionally, the policy could increase school participation and engagement among students who are less athletically inclined, thus boosting morale and school spirit.

On the other hand, the policy could place a strain on school budgets due to the need for additional facilities and equipment. Moreover, the policy could also take away from essential resources such as teacher salaries and classroom materials. Teachers may find it difficult to provide equal attention and motivation to all athletes.

Ultimately, the new policy could potentially benefit some schools, resulting in increased school spirit and greater access to sports. However, the disadvantages should be carefully considered before instituting such a policy.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Research current policy for school sports and compare it to potential new policy.

I don't think u should make the students of our school do community service because that will take away there time if its after school or there learning time if its during school. it would also be to hard to make all of the students of the school to do that the school could use its time to help the school.

If we had to do community service during school it would take time away from our learning and the students need as much time as they can in school to learn what they are doing so they can pass tests and pass the grade. If it was after school it could take time away from the students doing their homework, because most of the students have to do their homework after school and help clean their house. If they are in a sport also they wouldn't have enough time to help the community if it was mandatory.

7476076AF500,"Why asking multiple people for advice helps people make better choices

People always want to find a single, simple answer. Though, people can't find that answer in just one way. Sometimes people can find multiple answers in multiple people, but that does not make it the right answer. It's always better to ask trusted people of advice, but sometimes there not there to ask, so asking others can get results as well. Asking multiple people can help so others can do their best, it can broaden someones options to better choices, and so that people can know what's right .

One reason why asking multiple people can help to make healthy decisions, is so that people can do their best. One example of this is called constructive criticism. An example of a job that has a lot of constructive criticism is an editing firm. Writers will have editors who will instruct the writer what needs to be changed or added. Sometimes, the editor sends copies of the book to friends or colleagues so they can get even more input so they can help the writer as much as possible. That is why constructive criticism can help people make healthy decisions.

Another reason people ask multiple people so they can make the healthy choice, is so that people can broaden their options. There is never only one right option, there can be multiple right options! Sometimes people will get really good advice from someone, but they can't fallow the advice because of some type of setback. So getting multiple healthy choices can help the person so if they need too, they can still get where they want to go. Even if there is a really great answer, people can't always fallow it.

The final reason why asking multiple people for advise can help make healthy decisions, is so that they know what the right decision is. If someone asks only one person, they will only get their opinion on what is right. Asking more than one person however, someone could see that maybe person A would rather lie than to tell the truth, while maybe the persons B, C, and D would tell the truth. Now, based off of others morals, it would be better and healthier to tell the truth rather than to lie. People may have different opinions, but it's still important to do what is right.

In the past few paragraphs, it explains why people would want to ask multiple people so that they can make the best decision possible. In the first paragraph, it explains why people would give constructive criticism to others and how it could help them. In the second paragraph, it talked about how broadening someones options can help them find multiple good answers. Finally, in the last paragraph, it explains the importance of finding the best answer even if some people disagree. That is why a person might ask multiple people, so that they can make the best and healthiest decision they can.",0,persuade_corpus,,0

79887DA7C1B1,"Summer is a time that both students and teachers tend to enjoy. It gives the students a chance to relax, and not worry about things such as homework, projects, quizzes, and tests. The teachers also get a chance to take a break from grading and assigning work. Yet, if students still had to do a summer project in order to keep learning over the summer, it should be student-designed because students tend to be busier over the summer with many different things, and the project should cater to their schedule.

During the school year, most students are very busy with school work, along with different activities such as jobs, sports, and school clubs. For the most students, summer is the only opportunity that they have to relax, or spend time with family and friends. Vacations and family events are usually panned to take place during the summer. And a school project could interfere with that precious time. The student should be the one to design the project in order for it to be flexible to their schedule.

Students designing their on projects would also be a great opportunity for teachers to get a break. Many teachers tend to spend hours on end coming up with lesson plans and grading work. Although teachers would still have to grade the project, the student would be taking a small work load off of the teacher by designing the summer project themselves, And, it could possibly educate the teacher on a different subject.

Giving students the benefit of designing the summer project could also let them be more creative =, and enjoy the task at hand. Most of the time when students have to do projects, it is based off of a subject that is being taught in school: Such as math, history, and science. Letting students be more creative could also allow them to integrate their summer project into their summer schedule. Such as calculating the total amount of hours they have worked, doing historic research on the family vacation spot, or counting how many steps was taken during a hike.

Some may argue that students would not be responsible enough to plan and execute the summer project. Though, there are students who do not do the appropriate amount of work throughout the school year, many students already handle great responsibilities in their life; such as babysitting a younger sibling, sports practices, and having a job to not only support themselves, but their families too.

As previously stated, summer is usually an important time for both students and teachers. Rather they use it to participate in activities, or family events. Or, relax and take a break from school and work. At the end of the day, a student's education is important to maintain. But, so is their time and schedules. That is why students should be the ones to design their own summer project.

E57E60E07425,"The push to conserve resources and energy is well underway across many different institutions, from businesses to schools. Schools are particularly well suited to implement changes in practice that can significantly reduce energy usage, as many have already done through green renovations and adopting more sustainable practices. One proposal that is gaining traction is for schools to extend their day two hours, while shortening the school week to four days. This idea has both its benefits and drawbacks, and they should be carefully weighed before any policy is enacted. 

On the plus side, extending the school day by two hours, coupled with a four-day work week, can certainly help to conserve resources and energy. This is because the school building can be kept at a more stable temperature for longer periods of time while still opening and closing fewer days, and energy-intensive operations like air conditioning and lighting can be used less frequently and for shorter periods of time. This can also lead to cost savings for the school while being better for the environment overall. 

However, this proposal also comes with some drawbacks. For one, the extended school day would necessitate an extension of the school year, resulting in higher costs for the school in providing more instruction and greater disruption of winter and summer breaks. Additionally, while the four-day work week may offer more flexibility for teachers, it could create more stress for staff and administrators, who would have to fit more work into a shorter amount of time. Finally, students—particularly older students—may find it difficult to adjust to longer days. 

Ultimately, any proposed change in school policies should be evaluated carefully, and the potential advantages and disadvantages for energy and resource conservation should be taken into account. It is important to consider the various impacts of the extended school day and four-day work week proposal before any decisions are made.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Write an essay discussing the advantages and disadvantages of a school extending its day two hours and adopting the four day work week model in order to conserve energy and resources.,4

The Face is just formed by conveniently placed shadows. NASA wishes there was life on Mars becase they would benefit from it, so why would they try to cover up something that could get them a lot of popularity and money. Scientists researched this farther and released even better pictures proving it was just a landmass and not an alien artifact. People believe that the clouds could've covered up alien markings but that seems illogical because in 2001 they went back to the face and took more pictures with even higher resolution and found that there were no markings at all, meaning more evidence leaning towards the Face just being a natural landmass and not an alien artifact. It was just a mesa the whole time.

So there is a lot of evidence leading you to believe that the Face on Mars is merely just a natural landmass called a mesa, combined with shadows gives the mass a facelike texture. Lots of research shows you that the mass is very natural and not made by Aliens.            ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

So to start this off it could be a alien but there is a strong possibility that its not either. First the face is way to larg to be an actual face, it say it the artical the it is measured in meters, thats almost impossible. It also says in the artical that the face on mars was just an illusion caused by the shadowing on the rocks to make it look like a face.

91B88A23A5E4,"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that the school's policy of requiring a B average for students to participate in sports and activities is unfair and should be abolished. While academic achievement is important, it should not be the only factor that determines whether a student is allowed to participate in extracurricular activities. In this essay, I will present several arguments that support my position and explain why the policy is problematic.

First, academic achievement should not be the only factor that determines whether a student is allowed to participate in extracurricular activities. While academic achievement is important, it is not the only factor that should be considered. Students come from different backgrounds, and some may have more challenging circumstances than others. For example, some students may have to work part-time jobs to support their families, which can make it difficult for them to maintain a high GPA. Other students may have learning disabilities or other special needs that make it harder for them to achieve a high GPA. Therefore, it is unfair to exclude these students from participating in sports and activities simply because they do not meet the minimum GPA requirement.

Second, the policy can create a lot of stress and pressure on students. The pressure to maintain a high GPA can be overwhelming, and students may feel like they have to sacrifice their mental health and well-being to achieve it. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Moreover, the policy can create a lot of stress for parents, who may feel like they are not doing enough to help their children maintain a high GPA. This can lead to family tension and conflict.

Third, the policy can limit the opportunities for students to develop important skills. Participation in sports and activities can help students develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication. These skills are essential for success in many areas of life, including the workplace and beyond. By excluding students who do not meet the minimum GPA requirement, the school is limiting their opportunities to develop these important skills.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the school's policy of requiring a B average for students to participate in sports and activities is unfair and should be abolished. While academic achievement is important, it should not be the only factor that determines whether a student is allowed to participate in extracurricular activities. The policy can create a lot of stress and pressure on",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,9

They built a concept car that could run on a special track that was embedded with a electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Engineers at Berkeley tried something similar. They used magnets with alternating polarity, so the car could read the polarities using the binary code. All of this was proved to be too expensive. They started putting sensors on the cars, postion-estimating sensors, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor.

In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assiatant."" The car would be able to handle driving at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors makes sure the drivers keeps ahold of the wheel. Most of these cars are yet to be fully driverless, they can steer, accelerate, and brake on their own, but they all are designed to notify the driver when the rooad ahead requires human skills. Some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays would be turned off instantly when the driver needsto take over, this way the in-car system is acctually a safety feature.

Third of all, The only problem is that there are laws prohibiting the uses and testing of driverless cars. Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all time. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven more reliably safe. Traffic laws will have to change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. Automakers are still continuing with their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.

Therefore I am for driverless cars, because they could be helpful, they seem safe, and they are already being used by Google. There's no telling what's to come from the future of driverless cars. ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
2E7B7DA84C7A,"On May 24, 2001, a NASA Viking 1 spacecraft had saw a landform on Mars that had happened to look like a human face. The spacecraft had taken pictures of this landform and show the world a few days later in order to attract people to Mars. Some people, like conspiracy theorists, say that it's evidence of alien life that NASA has hidden from the public, but if this had been something NASA was hiding, they wouldn't have show that photo at all to the public. Scientists and astronaunts have denied this by adding titles that suggest otherwise on there photos, showing the photo in the first place, and going back up to space to take more pictures.

According to paragraphs 1 though 5, NASA had found a landforn that resembled a human face of an Egyptian Pharaoh located on a region called Cydonia. Mission control was surprised to see the face, but believed it was just another Martian mesa with unusual shadows, so they decided to reveal the pictures to the media, knowing there wasn't anything ""top secret"" or alien like about it. Then, according to paragraph 5, NASA had captioned the image, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth,"" basically telling the public that it was just a quirky looking natural landform, not a big alien conspiracy theory. People defending the NASA budget even claimed they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars, basically meaning there wasn't life that they knew of. Finally, in paragraph 7, another NASA spacecraft went over Cydonia on APril 5, 1998 and took better, sharper pictures, showing that it was just a natural landform that didn't have a civilization in it.

In conlusion, NASA was not trying to hide a whole big alien civilization theory from the world. They had just saw a cool natural landform with weird shadows that made it look like a human face and decided to share it with the world. If there was a conspiracy, NASA wouldn't have showed the picture to the world, added a title stating that it was an artifact, or have willingly went back up to space to take another picture of the landform. Therefore, NASA is not hiding any ancient alien civilizations from the United States, or any other part of the world.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

Technology developed over time so quickly, i remember, i used to had a flip phone but, now there is iphone X. No buttens at all and the face ID. Much as the technology developes the people will be seperated from each other.

Tesla just intreduced Tesla Model X. It has an auto pilot mode. Self driven car. Also they announced they making tunnel just for the auto pilot mode. Elon Musk says ""its much cheaper then the normal tunnel and safer"".

A338F87BFB2E,"Do you belive in the supernatural or in acient civilizations, like aliens? Well I don't. In the passage ""Unmasking the Face of Mars"" there are two major opinoins on if there once was a civilization on Mars or if it was a natural landform. Based on text and factual evidence I belive that the ""face"" on Mars is a natural land form.

First, ""on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" (10) ""Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoulotion."" (10) Which Means they got the best picure they could.

In addition, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digitial image 3 times bigger than you the pixel size. (11) ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you would be able to see what they were!"" (11) This proves that if it was a civilization, then it would have other structure too, but it doesn't.

My last peice of evidence comes from (paragraph 12), ""The picture acutally shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa0landforms common around the American West."" ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Gavin."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" (12)

Finally, to oppose my argument the article also stated that, ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. (9) Some people are not satisfied with the results. They say,""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" (9)

Based on experts, text, and factual evidence I belive that the ""Face"" on Mars is a natural land form. I belive that the ""Face"" on Mars is just a natural landform because the author uses evidnce like how they went back on a clear day a took magnified-detailed photos and how things would have showed up if there were things living on Mars. Now, do you belive that there are civilizations on Mars?    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
DB0A595A4723,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that children should not be required to perform community service. While community service can have its benefits, such as teaching children the value of helping others and building a sense of community, there are also several advantages to not requiring children to perform community service.

Firstly, community service can be time-consuming and take away from a child's education. Children have a lot of responsibilities and should be able to focus on their studies. By not requiring community service, children can have more time to study and improve their grades. Additionally, children can use their time to pursue their passions and interests, such as sports, music, or art.

Secondly, community service can be dangerous and put children at risk. Children may be exposed to hazardous materials or dangerous situations while performing community service. By not requiring community service, children can avoid these risks and focus on their safety.

Lastly, community service can be expensive. Children may have to pay for transportation, supplies, or equipment to perform community service. By not requiring community service, children can save money and use it for other important expenses, such as college tuition or books.

In conclusion, while community service can have its benefits, there are also several advantages to not requiring children to perform community service. Children should be able to focus on their education, avoid dangerous situations, and save money. It is important to consider these advantages when deciding whether or not to require community service for children.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,9

764BF089CE9C,"Summer assignment is a term most students would be appalled to hear about. For some, however, the concept of summer projects helps to ensure that students are continuing to learn and develop their education over the break. Due to the conditions summer work is assigned under, it poses the question of who should be designing the assignments, teachers or students? While teachers may have a broader understanding of the subject matter that their students will need to know and work on over summer, it is the students who should be assigning summer projects as they better understand which subjects they struggle in, know their own work schedule, and are able to make projects which appeal to their own interests.

First and foremost, students have a much better understanding of topics which they struggle on than their teachers do. Since teachers do not always understand the problems a student might be facing in class, it may lead the teacher to assign work which ends up becoming meaningless to the student and a waste of time for both student and teacher. Work assigned by students, on the other hand, may be much more personalized towards problems which students face inside their classes. This personalization of summer work for students ensures that while they learn new topics, they are still able to reinforce and improve in topics which might have caused many issues in the past.

The work schedule of a student is incredibly difficult to track. As such, if teachers were giving summer assignments, they might not be able to account for the massive diversity in the work schedules of students. Student designed summer projects would be much more effective as a learning tool, as students would have better judgment of how quickly any given student could complete their work, thus enabling students over the summer to learn at their own pace. By enabling students to learn at their own pace, they would not feel as rushed as they normally would when completing work for school, which in turn would result in students completing much higher quality work and getting more out of the learning experience.

Since all students are different, most students will not have the exact same interests. Under a design made by teachers, summer projects might end up dull or uninteresting towards many students as a whole, whereas student designed projects can appeal more to the interests of most, leading to more academic success overall. Under a student designed summer project, students can feel more involved in their assignments, and as such, will be more likely to choose things which interest them. By having students design summer assignments, they can select subjects which maintain their interest in education and provide for the improvement of previous lessons.

Teachers are not omnipotent. If they were, students would be able to find much more joy in an education experience much more personalized to their interests. Instead, throughout the school year, students are forced through a multitude of tasks which may not be up to par with their expectations. This issue, however, does not need to exist during summer projects as well. Under a student designed summer project, students can find much more interest in content which they otherwise might never learn, improve on subject areas concerning to them, and provide an adaptable schedule which matches their own work schedule, thus providing a better educational summer experience for everyone.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Being myself in a world that's always trying to make me something else can be really tough. Like, I know I'm not supposed to be weird or anything, but sometimes I just wanna be myself and not care what others think. You know? Like, when I visit nature, I feel like I can just be me and not worry about fitting in. Like, I went to this big forest the other day and it was so cool! The trees were so tall and the streams were so clear. I felt like I was in a whole different world. It was like, I could just be myself and not have to worry about anything else.

And then there's going to see big hills. Like, I know some people might think it's weird that I like hills so much, but I don't care. They're just so cool! You can see for miles and miles and it's just so peaceful. Like, I went to this one hill the other day and it was so windy that my hair was blowing all over the place. But it was also really pretty because the sun was setting and the sky was all orange and stuff. It was like, I could just be myself and enjoy the moment without worrying about anything else.

I think what I see in the world helps me understand the changing life around me. Like, I can see how nature changes with the seasons and how it's always different. It's like, it's always evolving and growing and it's just so cool. And I feel like that's what being myself is all about.

First,In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author says ""Earth's ""Twin"", Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". Since it has a lot in common with Earth it is good to have a litle insight on this planet. In the article it says that"" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sich as valleys, moutains, and craters"" this shows how much Earth and venus have incommon. This also gives us an opertunity to take a planetary visit to Venus in the future. Despite the dangers it could cause on someone.

Next, in the reading it says that Venus has"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxid blankets"" This is one example of how dangerous Venus is. In the article is says"" Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperatue of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun"" This is another example of how dangers Venus is. However going to Venus is not a bad idea beacuse life form could have been there in the past. People believe life forms could have existed beacuse of the examples like caters, moutains, and valleys. Despite Venus being the hottest planet in our solar system.

Then, on that note Venus is not the cloestet planet to the sun but has the highest tempature than all of your planet's in the solar system. However studying Venus can give us insight on what to make to prevent for somone or something burning on its surface. While we have been studying Venus all we have seen is a look from a ship orbiting above the planet, that gives us little intel on it surface. We get little intil from that beaucse "" most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere"". However if scientists seeking to conduct Venus will have to get closer to the planet.

Lastly, in the reading it says"" Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"" but not all people know that Venus is not a star it is a planet. However to a amateur stargazer it may just look like another star. Venus is called Earths twin beaucse of how alike they are in distance. Some scientist think this is intersting and want to look into this planet despite the dangers of it. Some scientist have looked into Venus but only have sent unmanned trips. The reasoning is the ship would only last a new hours at the most on Venus.

In Conclusion,Venus is a every intersitng plaet to look into. Despite the dangers it can cause.                ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
E7DB2DC8B151," In today's society, curfews have become a common practice to keep teenagers out of trouble and ensure they get enough rest. While some argue that curfews limit a teenager's freedom and restrict their social life, I believe that they have numerous benefits that outweigh the negatives.

Firstly, curfews help teenagers avoid dangerous situations and protect them from harm. Teenagers are more likely to engage in risky behavior when they are out late at night, such as drinking and driving, drug use, and violence. By setting a curfew, parents and guardians can ensure that their teenagers are safe and secure, away from potential danger.

Secondly, curfews help teenagers develop good sleep habits. Teenagers need adequate sleep to function properly, but many struggle to get enough rest due to late-night activities and school schedules. By setting a curfew, teenagers can establish a regular sleep schedule and wake up refreshed for school the next day.

Thirdly, curfews can help teenagers manage their time more effectively. With a curfew in place, teenagers can prioritize their responsibilities and plan their activities accordingly. This can help them develop better time management skills and prepare them for adulthood.

In conclusion, curfews have numerous benefits that can help teenagers stay safe, healthy, and responsible.

Also the computer know the percentages of your feeling the computer can tell you that your 80% happy and that your 10% mad and your 10% bored.

The computer can also tell if you dislike the ad its showing so it wont show anything similar to it but if it shows that you like the ad the computer will put another ad similar to the one you smiled or laughed at. Dr. Huang and his colleague made this kind of computer so that we humans can have better computers and better ways to communicate with each other. So we would know if someone is mad, sad, or glad so we can help them out with what they are going through. But the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face.

Dr. Huang relises that Dr. paul Eckman creator of facial action coding system has classified six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness then associated each with characteristic movments of the facial muscles.

plus the computer can also identify mixed emotions. the computer can also detect a painting of a face like Mona Lisa.

If i would have to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states , I would have to agree with keeping the Electoral college. I would agree because the Electoral college consists of 538 electors , a majority of 270 is required to elect presidents , and i think that it is a fair amount of people who are required to vote.

This Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors , the meeting where they vote for President and Vice president , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress . These votes are very important because with those votes you are making a very important choice by voting for the president and vice president , it should not stop because you could make a difference with just one vote you never know and you would not  want just anybody as your president , right ? These electotral votes should not stop .

This election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first Monday in November . If we make a vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our canditate electors , very important. After the presidential election your governor prepares what they call  "" Certificate of Ascertainment "" , what is that ?  it is listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors it is so important because it shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December year .

7C1D05780C33,"Well,this seems like a simple question with a simple answer but knowing me ill not make this simple in the slightest. Everyone had asked for advice in there life it's common this do in daily life,but sometimes we are uncertain of the answer we get after we ask for advice. Sometimes more than one person may help with a certain problem you have or may soon have. But is talking to an extra source helpful yes, yes it is. Here ill prove it to you.

When your shopping you always wonder ''Am I getting the best price?''If not your crazy. If you do than this is one of the time multiple opinions that may help. Here is a example. your shopping for a car and the price that the dealer ship is supisously to high you would probably look for people who have that car and ask for an opinion on how much should I buy it for so you know your not being scammed out of your money or maybe you can find out a way to get a much better car at a far better price. The possibility are endless when it come to buying things. This here is another example. I have an interest in LEGOs but I always have trouble when shopping for them and its always the same problem. The price,LEGOs,they a very fun yet expensive toy,A medium sized set could be over $50! As a kid that would be all of my saving but i've found a way to get them for a far better deal than I could ever hope and I do this by asking several people during the time my neighborhood has garage sales to see if there is any way I could get my hand on some LEGOs at a great bargain that and you always have EBay.

Imagine your in school but the day before you where really sick and couldnt remember if you had a test or your homework due that that day well never fear communication is here and with it you can check all of your best sources like your friend Generic_Name or Generic_Name they are both sources you can rely on because there are your friend and they would never lead you astray,right? All jokes aside this could be super yes I said super and i'm not five but this is super helpful lets throw in another example. Your walking home when you get a text from a friend they say that spring break will now be two weeks long and your unsure but when you ask another friend and they say its two weeks long and so your convinced,but what you didnt know as well as your friends is that the school announcements were off and that there was just one week of spring break and so you now have been gone from school thinking that school was out but in reality you have just missed a whole week of school. The sad part of this story is it could have all been avoided if you just confirmed with a few more sources. This does not only apply to school though. They just the easiest of the examples.

Now I know there will be at least one person who will have no one to talk to even about this. Never fear thats why the internet is here! Seriously these day you have all of the knowledge and opinions in the world at your finger tips but not only that but hundreds of sources that will indeed confirm any question or help you with an problem or get you any advice you need. this is not the only way other than human way to ask questions and be able to confirm you answers with it books not thousands but millions of books to chose form some are for stories but many are for information,information that can be confirmed with even crossing over the internet and humans to get the best advice or information ever!

Now you know all of the many ways and reasons to get multiple responses for many things need for everyday life. So now you know that with multiple opinions and facts you can make the best choices on nearly everything except gamboling you should never get hooked on gamboling because it bad so make sure you get multiple opinions and dont gamble because its bad!",0,persuade_corpus,,0
507DD961E85E,"Dear principal,

I think that students should only be required to perform community service when they are needed to or when wanted to. For example: ( If they have done something wrong to the school property they would have to clean up what they have done, or the students should be required if the are willing to do this kind of job to stand up for there community.) Mostly some students would love to do community service. Just show people how much awe they can show. I think it would be best for having volunteers to show up to do this kind of utilization.

This would help community be more of a clean place to be in if students are able to do community service in a plausible way. I would think that all students should not be forced to do this, but they should be offered to do it.

On May 24,2001-twenty-five years ago something weird happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was snapping pictures of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted something that looked like a face.

An enormous head seem to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Scientists thought it was just another Martian mesa,common around Cydonia. In paragraph two it states,'Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh'.The ''Face on Mars''has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film,appeared in books,magazines,radio talk shows ,and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!

In paragraph five it states,""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars and evidence that NASA would rather hide,say conspiracy theorists"". Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. On April 5,1998,Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time.

When we do this, we can start to establish long lasting meaningful connections and relationships with other people. We can also learn how to respect and value our own opinions and perspectives, instead of constantly worrying about what others think. 

Ultimately, being true to yourself is essential to our wellbeing and to our relationships. It helps to create authenticity, which is something that should not be taken lightly.

Are the peak of vehicles in the United States over? In the past, people predicted flying cars for 2015, but no one predicted a downfall in vehicles all together. Elisabeth Rosenthal states, ""the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily after... As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the contry was in January 1995."" So overall, less driving seems to becoming a trend.

Pollution caused by the gas of cars is a huge issue in today's society. Some cities are finally taking action. ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (Robert Duffer). Few may argue with this, saying that these sort of bans are not fair, delvery companies aren't able to work, or a some may argue about the fine of 31 dollars you're charged if your vehicle is on the road is riduculous. But, ""the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban""(Robert Duffer).            ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
8BCB7962E7E3,"The United States has one of the worst public school systems in the modern world. Places like Sweden and Denmark show fantastic, flawless designs that allow students to properly use their time for both school and non-school activities. Our public schools, however, show many flaws that were enacted by generations in the past. Students fail to learn proper time management, as they are forced to go to places they are unfamiliar with and follow prepared schedules in and out of class. As this continued, the government discovered the flaws and are beginning to try new solutions. One of these solutions is online classes that students can take at home. I believe that Students would benefit from online learning because it allows the students to learn in places more familiar to them, relearn challenging information, and build proper time management skills.

One of the systems' largest problem is forcing students to attend and learn in places that are unfamiliar and daunting to them. According to majority of students in a poll last year, research has shown that students consider school buildings as uncomfortable, as well as unfamiliar. On that same poll, the same research claimed that students found the idea of learning at home appealing, and a much better suited place to learn. This same evidence supports the ideas that parents whose children are in homeschooling programs share. Hearts, a homeschooling program ran through Generic_City and all over the east coast, has a much larger graduation rate in students and higher averaged grades than public schools in the same areas. Some people could argue that this holds the threat of exposing distractions to students. With the ability to modify their own environment, students can create their own spaces that allow them to concentrate on their studies with ease. All of this information supports the idea that learning at home is a working solution that the government should endorse and improve within their schools.

The second reason that online classing would be a good idea is the ability to allow students to study specifically hard material. Majority of current online classing has a system that allows teachers to record or stream lectures that explain the material. Then, if students had questions, the teacher could answer them in the stream or message the students independently. This method is fantastic, because all of the lectures can be recorded and shown for future reference at other times. If students didn't understand the material, they could just load up the needed information and relearn it and solidify the information into their memory. With this, students can make sure that they received and understood all of the content that they need to know for the classes that they are taking.

Finally, online classing would give students the opportunity to learn valuable time management skills. Along with having control over setting, students would be given control over how they use their time. Homeschooled students often have a lot of time to allocate for school and other activities. This is essential for every student to understand and master, as they will have the same choices when they grow into adults. Students who have other obligations outside of school will be allowed to modify their learning time each day, as well as take breaks from work as needed. Many people argue that students can abuse this opportunity as to skip learning altogether, and allow them to grow bad habits. The entire purpose behind having the choice is to learn from mistakes. If no mistakes were made, then no one could improve. Online classing allows students to learn what to do in a safe and open environment. Without that chance, students would make the same mistakes in more important matters, and harm their well being later in life.

The largest flaw that has been located is this: some students benefit more from learning in person rather than online. The beauty behind this whole process is that online classes don't eliminate the ability to have face to face classroom interactions that students have today. Yes, online classes are meant to somewhat eliminate this factor, but in person interactions are also needed to have students grow. Hearts, the program mentioned above, has a system that has students meet their teachers in person once or twice a week. This allows teachers to show students real life applications with the information taught in class, as well as give students the ability to have social interaction with both teachers and other students. This allows the students to gain the pros of both online classing and the modern classroom interaction

Students would benefit from online learning because it allows the students to learn in places more familiar to them, relearn challenging topics and units, and build proper time management skills. Throughout this article, evidence has been placed that support all three of these factors. Learning at home gives the students the ability to be taught in more comfortable environments rather than the common classroom. The ability to relearn lectures and other class materials allow students to master the topics given to them. Time management skills can be learned, as the students are given control over the ability to use their time in ways that they think is best. Even some of the common flaws of online classing has been addressed and solved. The ability to change the way we learn is something that I believe is essential to allow minds to reach their highest potential. No one learns the same way as the person next to them. That is why if people are starved of the choice to learn the way that they want, then us as a country will not be able to grow along with the rest of the world. If this method is amplified and improved, then America can become one of the most educated countries on earth.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
A38187259EEE,"As technology continues to advance, online classes have become increasingly popular among students of all ages. While some may argue that attending school in person is the only way to receive a quality education, there are many merits to taking online classes, especially for students with special needs, those who speak different languages, and those who have difficulty adjusting to the school environment.

Firstly, online classes offer a level of flexibility that traditional schooling cannot match. Students can complete coursework at their own pace, which is especially beneficial for those with special needs or learning disabilities. This allows them to take the time they need to fully understand the material and complete assignments to the best of their ability. Additionally, online classes can be taken from anywhere with an internet connection, which can be especially helpful for students who live in remote areas or have difficulty attending school in person due to transportation or other logistical issues.

Secondly, online classes can be a great option for students who speak different languages. With the ability to learn at their own pace and access course materials in their native language, these students can better understand and retain the information presented. This can be especially helpful for students who are new to the country or who are struggling to learn a new language in a traditional classroom setting.

Finally, online classes can be a great option for students who have difficulty adjusting to the school environment. Whether it's due to social anxiety, bullying, or other factors, these students can benefit from the ability to learn from the comfort of their own home. This can help to reduce stress and improve their overall well-being, which can ultimately lead to better academic performance.

In conclusion, there are many merits to taking online classes, especially for students with special needs, those who speak different languages, and those who have difficulty adjusting to the school environment. The flexibility, accessibility, and reduced stress that online classes offer can make a significant difference in the lives of these students, and can ultimately lead to better academic outcomes. While traditional schooling will always have its place, it's important to consider the unique needs and circumstances of each student and provide them with the best possible educational opportunities.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0

Extracurricular activity can get you in shape by exercising. First, if you want to get in shape got to eat healthy. Then, Find any outside activity that you like to play. last, have fun with your friends and enjoy it.

So understanding things can help you because when you grow older the things you have done in the past won't benefit you only when u grow older so thats why its good to learn in a young age.

Making new friends is good because you won't be shy when they call you to do something. Also, It's good to have friends because if one friend don't want to do sum thing then the other friend will gladly do it with you.

I think that student have a b average. I believe that they should have a C or B average to play sports. I say so because if the student goes out for a team with one point off from a B average and the have a C average then they might be hurt. With a B average they are doing good but no disrespect a C average isn't failing so why not make it that as well.

Now if the kid had a D average they should be taken off the team they are on so they can pull it up and not get low grades again. Most kid think that if they had again in the middle of school the have an excuse to not do their home work but that their fault. With a C average kids can work hard so they don't drop down to a D.

Another reason that you should make it a C average is so the team at the school wont get dropped from any events. With most of the kid with C' s the school may not have any events for kids to try out for. With that the coach might not have time to try out the kids for the team. some coaches might not even let the kid try out.

E98FABC326F7,"After school clubs are an excellent way to help students improve their academic achievement. These clubs provide a safe and supportive environment where students can learn, grow, and develop new skills. In this essay, I will discuss some ways to help improve student achievement in after school clubs, including the advantages to students and teachers participating, and how the after school club environment can bring about a positive impact.

One way to help improve student achievement in after school clubs is by providing opportunities for students to engage in hands-on activities. For example, science clubs can conduct experiments, art clubs can create projects, and technology clubs can build and program robots. These activities allow students to apply what they have learned in class and develop practical skills that will be useful in the future. Additionally, these activities can help students develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and creativity.

Another way to help improve student achievement in after school clubs is by providing opportunities for students to work collaboratively with their peers. For example, debate clubs can practice public speaking and argumentation skills, and drama clubs can work together to create a performance. These collaborative activities can help students develop teamwork skills, communication skills, and leadership skills. Additionally, these activities can help students build strong relationships with their peers and develop a sense of community.

Participating in after school clubs can also have advantages for teachers. For example, teachers can use these clubs as an opportunity to provide additional support to students who may be struggling academically. Additionally, teachers can use these clubs to develop new teaching strategies and techniques. For example, a science teacher may use a science club to experiment with different teaching methods and assess student learning.

The after school club environment can also bring about a positive impact on student achievement. For example, after school clubs can provide a safe and supportive environment where students can feel comfortable asking questions and making mistakes. Additionally, after school clubs can provide a break from the rigors of the school day and give students a chance to relax and recharge. This can help students come back to class more focused and motivated.

In conclusion, after school clubs are an excellent way to help improve student achievement. Providing opportunities for hands-on activities, collaborative activities, and additional support from teachers can all contribute to student success. Additionally, the after school club environment can provide a positive impact on student achievement by providing a safe and supportive environment where students can feel comfortable asking questions and making",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,3
F9E7D51B3006,"Online shopping is never an easy task. After locating what you want to purchase within the vast sea of goods, you must decide which specific type of your desired item you would like. Different companies sell differing styles of the same item, and you may not know at first which item style will benefit your uses the most. That's the time when you ask for the opinions of real, physical people. You may wonder how many people you should ask for the inputs of. The number of opinions you receive can affect all kinds of decisions you make, not just that of what company to buy from. Seeking multiple opinions will assist you much better in your decision-making than asking a single individual will.

Among the multiple people you ask, some will be experts on your topic. Some will be highly experienced in the action you need help in taking, whether it's buying a new television or selecting the next spot for your summer vacation. These two groups of wise individuals will have the most trustworthy advice and thoughts. Their inputs will be the main benefactors of your decision. However, not everybody has something noteworthy to state. Some people you ask will do nothing but waste your time. They will act like they know what is being asked of them, but everything they say to you will end up being completely nonsensical. These speakers of logic-empty phrases are advisers to ignore when seeking useful inputs for an important decision of yours.

Another detail to observe when asking for advice is the neutrality of the response you receive. Inexperienced advisers can be a hindrance, but the biased can be just as much of a distraction. Looking back at the online shopping example, some of the people you meet will try to endorse a certain company or strike down a company they do not like. Others will have had an unsatisfactory experience with their product, but the cause of that may only be because they were not successful in making their item work properly. A certain product might truly be a bad choice for purchase, but you cannot make that conclusion without talking to multiple people and hearing the same complaints from everyone. After asking a group of individuals, it will be clear which side of the story is true. The concept of majority comes into big use here.

In order to avoid advice that sways you, the thoughts of multiple people should always be sought out before you make a decision. While you should note that not all advice is worth being followed, keep in mind that some inputs are legitimate and should be taken into account. By ruling out opinions that do not help and reviewing those that do, any and every decision you make can and will be the best one possible in any given situation.",0,persuade_corpus,,0

So then the clinic in the school could have less people in there as well. On the bad side it could mean less family time, less sleep, and less or stuff you enjoy and are not forced to do. The principal might have done that to make the school look better or for the kids to be better at a variety of things. Also the principal could have done that because the sports there dont have enough players. The kids could have one of two responses to the decision the principal made. They could be mad at the principal because they want to go home right after school and rest all evening. And be able to do something there not forced to do. They could also be happy because there parents might not have let them play sports and now its requied so they can now play a sport. Or help with the yearbook after school. The sports players are probably happy about the decision the principal made. Because they can now have a full team and probably extra people to and they would actually be able to play a season because they have a full team.

Overall i feel like its not that bad of a decision from the principal depending on what the reason he did that was for. If the principal did it for the school to look better and get money back then i dont agree with the principal at all,because there are other ways of getting money and making the school look better without forcing the kids to do something some off them may not like. And risking losing kids from your school,If the pricipal did it for the kids to get in shape and learn a variety of different skills. Then yes i agree with him 100 percent because that could cut the amount of people going to the clinic and varies things like that,which means kids are missing less class time to go to the clinic. The parents will most likely have one of the two same responses as the kids and some might even move there familys to a new school due to the decision the principal made. Some of the kids may even not play nor do what there told because it is a demamded thing from the principal you cant just get kicked out and do something else.

Summer break is like, the best thing that happens to us students every year. I mean, it's like, we get to chill for like, a whole month without having to worry about school or homework or anything. And let me tell you, it's like, super important for our mental health and stuff.

First of all, summer break gives us a chance to relax and recharge. Like, after a whole year of learning and studying and being super focused all the time, it's nice to just chill and do nothing for a bit. It's like, our brains need a break from all the information and stuff, and summer break gives us that chance to just chill and unwind.

And it's not just good for our brains, but also for our physical health. Like, when we're not in school, we get to do more stuff outside and get more exercise. We can go to the beach or the pool, or play sports or whatever. It's like, way better than sitting inside all day doing homework.

Plus, summer break gives us a chance to explore our interests and passions outside of school. Like, if we're really into art, we can take a painting class or something. Or if we're into sports, we can join a league or camp. It's like, our chance to try new things and figure out what we're really into.

Distance learning is a great option for high school students for many reasons. First of all, it allows students to learn from the comfort of their own homes, which can be really helpful for those who have jobs or other responsibilities outside of school. For example, if a student has a part-time job, they can use the time they would normally spend commuting to work on their schoolwork instead. Or, if a student needs to get some last-minute credits to graduate, they can take distance learning courses to make up for missed credits.

Another benefit of distance learning is that it can be really helpful for students with physical or psychological disabilities. For instance, if a student has a physical disability that makes it hard for them to get to school every day, they can take distance learning courses to avoid missing out on schoolwork. Or, if a student has a psychological disability that makes it hard for them to be in a traditional classroom setting, distance learning can provide them with a more comfortable and flexible learning environment.

One of the best things about distance learning is that it can give students more time for other activities they enjoy. For example, if a student wants to work on their art skills, they can use the time they would normally spend on homework to practice drawing or painting. Or, if a student wants to spend more time with their family, they can use the time they would normally spend on schoolwork to hang out with their parents or siblings.

In terms of achieving educational and professional goals, distance learning can be really helpful. For instance, if a student wants to get into a certain college, they can take distance learning courses to improve their grades and make themselves a more competitive applicant. Or, if a student wants to start their own business, they can use the skills they learn in distance learning courses to develop their entrepreneurial skills.

Overall, distance learning is a great option for high school students who want more flexibility and time to pursue their interests.

llama_70b_v1840,"Dear Principal,

I believe that Policy 1, allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, is the better option for our school.

Firstly, this policy allows students to stay connected with their parents and guardians during emergencies. In today's world, cell phones are an essential tool for communication, and it is important for students to have access to their phones in case of an emergency. By allowing students to have their phones during lunch and free periods, they can quickly contact their parents if needed.

Secondly, this policy promotes responsibility and trust among students. By allowing students to have their phones, we are giving them the responsibility to use them appropriately during class time. This teaches students the importance of following rules and being responsible for their actions. Moreover, it also shows that we trust our students to make the right decisions, which can boost their confidence and self-esteem.

Thirdly, this policy does not disrupt the learning environment. As long as students turn off their phones during class time, there is no distraction caused by phones. In fact, studies have shown that students who are allowed to use their phones during breaks have better focus and productivity during class time.

Lastly, this policy aligns with the current trend of technology integration in education. Many schools have already embraced technology and are using it to enhance learning. By allowing students to have their phones, we can incorporate technology into our daily routine and use it to support our learning.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 is the better option for our school. It allows students to stay connected with their parents, promotes responsibility and trust, does not disrupt the learning environment, and aligns with the current trend of technology integration in education.

777E845C3A93," The significance of a positive attitude in life cannot be overstated. It is often said that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. This essay will explore the importance of having a positive attitude and how it can help individuals achieve their goals.

Firstly, a positive attitude is crucial for one's own well-being. When a person has a positive attitude, they tend to focus on the good things in life, which can lead to increased happiness and satisfaction. For example, a person with a positive attitude may be more likely to take care of their health, exercise regularly, and eat a balanced diet. They may also be more likely to pursue hobbies and interests that bring them joy and fulfillment.

Secondly, a positive attitude can also help individuals achieve their goals. When a person has a positive attitude, they tend to be more optimistic about their future and more likely to take action towards their goals. They may be more motivated to work hard and persist through challenges, knowing that their efforts will ultimately lead to success. For example, a student with a positive attitude may be more likely to study regularly, attend class, and seek help when needed. They may also be more likely to participate in extracurricular activities that align with their interests and goals.

However, it is important to note that having a positive attitude is not always enough to achieve success. It must be paired with hard work, dedication, and perseverance. A positive attitude can provide the motivation and energy needed to overcome obstacles and setbacks, but it cannot replace the actual effort required to achieve one's goals.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is essential for one's own well-being and achieving success in life. While it is not the only factor that determines success, it can provide the motivation, energy, and optimism needed to overcome challenges and achieve one's goals. By cultivating a positive attitude, individuals can improve their quality of life and increase their chances of success.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

I believe you should allow all of the students in our school, to use their cell phones during lunch other free times, during the school schedule. It would be extremely beneficial to us. For example there are many students in the school who break the rules break by using it during class, which distracts them from what the teacher is instructing the class or lecture they are trying to give. At the same time the student is risking the confiscation of their cell phone. If the new rule is implemented, students will put their cell phones away during class, because they will know as soon as the bell rings, they will have enough free time to text their friends or receive important calls. That way during class, the instructor has their full and undivided attention.

As I said early, students may have to receive urgent and important cell phone calls from their parents, regarding transportation issues and family emergencies. For example, if a student's mother is forced to work a double shift at her minimum wage job and needs to contact her son to tell him to ask, one of his class mates to give a ride or take the bus. He will receive the call, because according to school police, cell phones and all other electronic device should remain off during school. The child will stuck at school wondering, why his mother hasn't picked him up, after waiting long than usual.

For these reasons I believe cell from            ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
9DF267887BEB," I disagree with the notion that first impressions are always accurate representations of a person. It is not always the case that what we see is who we get. People often change their behavior to impress others, and this can be for a variety of reasons. For example, someone may change their appearance to attract attention or to fit in with a particular group. Similarly, someone may act differently to impress others, such as being more outgoing or confident.

It is also important to note that not all first impressions are based on accurate information. People often make assumptions about others based on their appearance or behavior, but these assumptions may not always be accurate. For instance, someone may be shy or introverted, but when they are around people they like or need, they may act differently.

I agree that changing one's behavior or appearance to impress others can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can help to make a good first impression and potentially lead to new opportunities. On the other hand, it can also be exhausting and may not always be authentic to who you are.

In conclusion, while first impressions can be important, they are not always accurate representations of a person. It is important to be true to oneself and not to change who you are to impress others. Instead, focus on being the best version of yourself and let your actions and behavior speak for themselves.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

E7F9A77683D2,"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student on the topic of phone use during school lunch:

Pros and Cons of Phone Use During School Lunch

As an 8th grader, I think it's pretty cool that we get to have our phones out during lunch. I mean, it's not every day that you get to scroll through TikTok or play a game during lunchtime. But, I also know some people who think it's really distracting and that it takes away from our learning. So, I'm here to tell you about the pros and cons of having a policy that allows phone use during school lunch.

First, let's talk about the pros. Having our phones out during lunch can be really helpful for people who have to eat alone or who don't have many friends to sit with. It's a way for them to connect with their friends or family who are not in the same school. It's also a good way to stay organized and keep track of appointments or events. Plus, who doesn't love taking a quick scroll through Instagram or Twitter during lunch? It's a nice break from the usual school routine.

But, there are also some cons to having phones out during lunch. For one thing, it can be really distracting. I've seen people scrolling through their phones instead of paying attention to what their teachers are saying or what's going on around them. It can also be really disruptive when people are talking on their phones during lunch. It's hard to have a conversation with someone who is more interested in their phone than in talking to you. And, let's be real, who doesn't get annoyed when someone is constantly checking their phone?

So, what do I think? Personally, I think it's okay to have phones out during lunch, but only if you're not being disruptive. I think it's important to be able to stay organized and connected with your friends and family, but you shouldn't be so focused on your phone that you forget about everything else. And, if you're going to be on your phone, try to be considerate of the people around you.

In conclusion",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay analyzing the pros and cons of having a policy that allows the use of phones during school lunch versus a policy that doesn't allow the use of phones during school lunch.,5
E70DD00622DB,"As an 8th grade student, I have to say that technology has had a huge impact on our lives. It's like, everywhere you go, people are glued to their phones or tablets, and it's like, hard to imagine life without them now. Like, my mom is always on her phone when she's cooking or watching TV, and my dad is always on his laptop when he's working from home. It's like, they can't put their phones down for a minute!

Anyway, so I did some research on how technology has affected people's lives, and I found some really cool things. Like, did you know that technology has made it so much easier for disabled people to communicate and access information? There are like, special apps and software that can help them type or speak, and it's really cool. And for busy people, there are like, online shopping and researching tools that make it so much faster and easier to get things done. It's like, no more running to the store or library to do research, you can just do it all online!

But technology isn't just useful for everyday life, it can also be used in emergency situations. Like, during natural disasters, technology can help people communicate with each other and get help. And in the military, technology has come a long way. There are like, drones and other cool gadgets that can help soldiers do their jobs better and safer. It's like, technology has really improved over the years!

But some people say that technology promotes laziness. Like, they think that because we can do so much online, we're not exercising our brains as much as we used to. But I don't think that's true. I mean, sure, we might not have to walk to the library to do research, but that doesn't mean we're not learning anything. And besides, technology can also help us learn new things and explore new ideas. It's like, it's not just a distraction, it can also be a tool for learning!

Hello my name is STUDENT_NAME, and i would like to tell you about how i feel on your new policy for sports and curriculum .

Well many people including me have a C average as our grade. But that doesn't mean you should punish us. We very well could be failing but were trying our very hardest to not be. Many things in the curriculum are very difficult for us to grasp, and understand, but that doesn't mean we aren't trying our very hardest to get our grades up. now this is not the case for every student, but in my case it is. I am having a great deal of difficulty in math right now, and that's because we are covering an area of material that I don't fully understand. I keep trying harder and harder everyday but the formulas and numbers just don't add to me. But I have had a great grade in this class all year until we got onto this subject. Many kids struggle with a subject that is difficult for them to learn. But we shouldn't punish them for it, just because they don't understand. Now I can understand why you would change the policy for people who don't care about they're grade's and don't care to keep them up. But for the kids that do care they're just not getting the material that we are learning, why should they be punished to. Maybe being in a sport will help them learn that, if they want to stay on the sport then they have to keep they're grade's up. Also if you change the policy many students will have to leave the sport they love, and you will have not very big teams and the school would lose a lot of money. Now I'm not asking you to lower the policy of the grade average but all I'm saying is, us students try our hardest everyday to do our best, But sometimes our best isn't good enough. But why should we get punished just because we had a rough or an off week. maybe sports will help the students mature and learn that they have to keep they're grade up if they want to stay with the sport they love.

So please Principal TEACHER_NAME, please reconsider changing your policy of our grade average. I think that if the policy stays the same then the students, you, the school, and the district will benefit from our curriculum and sport life. So thank you for taking the time out to read my letter and I hope you think about reconsidering, I promise you and others will benefit from leaving the policy the way it is. Thank you again.

The author does not explain the pros of exploring Venus as well as they explain the cons of why we should explore Venus. Why do I think this? Well the autor describes the deadly, hot and thick atmosphere of Venus, stating that the reason exploring Venus is worth the risk is because ""Venus still has some features that are analigous to those on Earth."" Well, does that justify spending millions or hundreds of millions of dollars on a rover or a spacecraft to explore it? I don't beleive so.

It's quite simple to explain why Venus does not need to be explored or closly examined from high up in it's atmosphere. The pros do outweigh the cons in this aticle, here is a quote from the author: ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" That temperature is obviously deadly to humans, and that is a major risk when it comes to spending millions on making a rover that will only last up to a couple hours just to get a glimps on the planet. Or maybe just to get a couple pictures. The author does not go on to say how exploring Venus with genuinley benifit the human race. The author simply explains how scientists are curious about the planet and what is on it, I do not beleive that satisfying our curiosity will help anyone. This is a quote from paragraph 8 of the article that states: ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likley lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""

Now, to add on to the last quote I stated from the article, the author does not state what the human race would do with that ""insight"" that we would gain about Venus, they just state that we would have insight. well then I would ask the author, what is the point in the insight if we wouldn't be able to do anything with the insight that we have gained from the exploration? All that we would gain from spending millions on sending a spacecraft to Venus would be meaningless insight and the feeding of our curiosity. When there are many bigger issues to be solved here on Earth. For example, the crisis that is curently happening in Venesuala, their government is shut down and millions are starving, some familys have resorted in digging through the trash for food and we could help them, but instead we want to spend money on gaining ""insight"" about Venus? Which the article states that Venus is too dangerous to go to anyway. It angers me that half of New York could be underwater in the next thirty years from global warming but we are worried about getting a small peek into the world of Venus.

I do understand why Scientists would like to go to Venus, it would be a great acheivement for humanity. But I am a firm beleiver that our planet should come first, after all, we do only get one Earth, that means we must take care of it. Maybe one day when Our problems down here are solved and we have the ability to really gain benifits from Venus then I will want us to explore more. But for now I'm sticking to the thought that our planet comes first. In conclusion, no, I do not beleive that the author of this article did a good job at explaining why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers of it. Because in the end it's not just the dangers of going to Venus that keeps me from beleiving that we should. It's the problems that we are facing here on Earth that are far more important.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
C1DB1D0F69D8,"I feel that this could be very usefull in the class room. It could help teaches see what the students are thinking via their emotions they might not think are showing, but their facial mucles are. You could read a whole crowd of people if you where in a lecture teaching about the complex system of the worlds goverments which I am sure every one loves (not) you could see this and change your approach. It would greatly help teachers all around the world I feel if they could get their hands on this technology.

Now imagine if you are teaching a class and all your students where not paying any attintion to the way you are teaching. You could change that if only you knew this complex system of facial mucles better to tell if what they where feeling about your teaching. Then you could change your teaching style in a way that they prefered to learn so they are not so board. Now there is a computer system that can read emotions by looking at what facial mucles are being used. This would help you reach your students better. ""In fact, we humans preform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" said Nick D'Alto. He even goes on later to say "" Yet Dr. Hyang observes that artist such as da Vinci studied human anatomu to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emtions. His new computer software stores similar anatomicl information as electronic code."" This shows how largly it would help us keep in connection with eachother if we knew what they felt about a certian subject becasuse we are only human and can only handle so much.

E2F31005AF32,"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about extending the school day! I know, I know, it might seem like a total drag, but trust me, it's actually pretty cool. So, like, you know how we're always talking about saving energy and resources and making the world a better place? Well, extending the school day is like, a super duper way to do that!

First of all, let's talk about energy. When we extend the school day, we can use less energy on things like heating and cooling the building. Like, think about it, if we're in school for longer, we don't need to turn on the AC or heat as much, right? That's like, a ton of energy saved! And that's not even counting the energy we'll save from not having to use lights and stuff during the summer when it's super bright outside. It's like, a total no-brainer!

But it's not just about energy, it's also about natural resources. When we extend the school day, we can use more recycled materials in our classrooms. Like, instead of using new paper for all our worksheets and stuff, we can use recycled paper. It's like, super easy and it helps the environment so much! And think about all the trees we'll save! It's like, whoa!

But it's not just about saving energy and resources, it's also about leading the way to a better world. When we extend the school day, we can learn more about how to take care of the planet and how to make a difference. Like, we can learn about climate change and how to reduce our carbon footprint. It's like, super important stuff! And if we can teach other people about it too, then we can make a real difference. It's like, totally cool!

So, like, I know some people might be like, ""Ugh, I don't want to be in school longer!"" But trust me, it's worth it. We can make a real difference and save energy and resources. And who knows, maybe one day we'll be like, the leaders of the world or something! It's like, totally possible!

951B691D3564,"School today went by as slow as a snail, but as soon as I took the last step off my bus home, I raced down my street to see the answer I had been waiting for the whole day: If I made it into the Spanish Immersion Specialty center or not. The thrill of the answer made my legs move even faster, so fast that I bolted into the house as quick as lightning, and straight to the kitchen counter where the taunting envelope had been sitting. My family joined me to see what would be revealed inside the envelope as I carefully removed the paper that had been surrounding the letter. ""I got in!"" I happily shouted. All of that worrying was for nothing. But eventually, my brother came up to me, and asked,""You're not actually going to do the Spanish Immersion program, are you?"" I was confused. I didn't realize his opinion on the program was really different from mine. ""Why wouldn't I?"" I responded. ""I don't know, it just seems kind of dumb to me. Also you have to take math in Spanish, and it's already hard enough in English. If I were you I wouldn't do it."" he told me. He began to walk away, as I wondered ""Is this the best thing for me? Maybe he's right. I guess I was all excited just to be in the program that I didn't realize all the challenges I would have to face."" I thought to myself. My Mom made the program seem like a walk in the park, but now by brother is saying it's going to be more difficult than that, which has really changed my opinion about the program. I now think that receiving advice from different people is important because different people are going to have different points of views of the topic, asking only one person might not give me the right advice, and I think the more advice people give me the more strongly I can be sure of a future decision.

First off, I think receiving advice from multiple people is important because everyone is going to have different points of views on the same topic. I would like to start off by saying that no one is the same, therefore receiving as much advice as I can from multiple types of people is going to be more beneficial for my decision than to just hear it from only one person. Plus, their reasoning of why I should or shouldn't say yes to this decision might be not as good as some other reasons I could receive. No one's advice is going to be completely perfect, but it's best to hear from them to see what they think the wise decision would be. Also, no one has the same experiences, so while one person may believe this because of their experiences, another could think the completely opposite because of what they have been through. All I'm saying is many people believe in different things and that is okay because as humans, we are all different from one another.

Secondly, I believe asking more people for advice is the more beneficial thing to do because asking one person may not give me the advice I need. For instance, if I had just asked my mom about the Spanish Immersion program, she would obviously encourage me to go because she doesn't know what it's actually going to be like, but my brother on the other hand, speaks from a regular high school student's perspective and is telling me I shouldn't go. Both of their advice helps me see the pros and cons of the program. If I had only asked one of them, I would only see the pros, or I would only see the cons. Asking one person is a mistake because I will only see their perspective, which their perspective may not be right for someone. They're are many people out in the world who can help out with advice, so don't be afraid to ask!

Lastly, I think it is important to seek out more advice from people because it can help a person be sure of the decision they're going to choose. Making certain choices can be really difficult and confusing at times, but having people there helping me out with this decision is the greatest gift somebody could ask for. Their help with my decision makes me see the different parts of the program, which helps make the best choice for me. Advice is extremely important because it has a big factor in decision making. Hearing about someone's past experiences with a job, or a certain company can really help put a decision in perspective. If I ever need help with another big choice, I'll be making sure to ask for advice again because receiving opinions on a certain subject can really be substantial for a choice.

To sum everything up, seeking out opinions from other people can really influence our choices in a good way. That's why I think receiving advice from different people is important because everyone has different points of view on a topic, asking only one person may not give me the advice I need, and the more advice people give me the more I can be sure of a choice I make. Big decisions can be hard to make. Asking people for thier input on what they think I should do should never be a scary thing to do; in fact, I think being asked for advice in general would make the person being asked feel proud because someone is coming to them for help. In the future, the best way to make a certain choice is to base it around other's advice.                                                                                                                  ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
A366CC7B0D05,"First impressions are a crucial aspect of human interaction. They are the initial thoughts and feelings we have about someone or something, and they can greatly influence our future interactions with that person or thing. However, the question arises whether first impressions are truly impossible to change. In my opinion, first impressions can be changed over time, and I will provide two examples of how my first impression of someone has changed over time.

My first example is my impression of my English teacher in high school. When I first met her, I thought she was strict and unapproachable. She always seemed to be in a bad mood, and she would give harsh feedback on our assignments. I believed that she was not someone I could connect with, and I was hesitant to approach her for help or advice. However, as time went on, I began to see a different side of her. I realized that she was passionate about teaching, and she genuinely cared about her students' success. She would often take the time to listen to our concerns and offer words of encouragement. I also noticed that she was not as strict as I had initially thought. She would give us more freedom to express our opinions and ideas in class, and she would often praise our efforts and accomplishments. Through these experiences, my first impression of my English teacher has changed completely. I now view her as a supportive and caring mentor, and I am grateful for the positive impact she has had on my life.

My second example is my impression of my neighbor. When I first moved into my house, I did not know my neighbor very well. I would occasionally see them outside or hear them playing music, but we never really spoke. I assumed that they were a reclusive and antisocial person, and I did not want to intrude on their privacy. However, as time went on, I began to see a different side of them. I would notice that they would often be outside playing with their dog, and they would wave and smile at me as I passed by. I also heard them laughing and joking with their friends, and I realized that they were not as reserved as I had initially thought. Through these experiences, my first impression of my neighbor has changed completely. I now view them as a friendly and outgoing person, and I enjoy striking up conversations with them whenever I see them.

Do you want an adventure? Maybe you should try something called seagoing. Seagoing would be a fun and educational trip where you get to help others, and make a diffrence in the world. The following reasons are why you should try seagoing.

In the text in paragraph number two it states that, ""It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left to ruins."" From this piece of infomaion you can tell that people in Europe are facing hard times and that is why it is important to help those people. Furthermore, in paragraph number, eight it talks about how the cowboys also found time to have some fun. For instance in the text it says, ""The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table- tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.""

From this sentance you can tell the cowboys did not only work but had fun as well. Not only this but in paragraph number five it talks about the sights of Europe and China. For example in the text it states that,"" Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

Also in the last paragraph it talks about how great the learning experince was. I know this because in the text it states that, ""It opened up the world to him. I'm grateful for the opportunity, he say's. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" For this piece of evidene I can infer that the trip was not just to see the sights and have fun but to get a learning exerince out of the trip. Many people may disagree with me and argue that the trip is not necessary. Why?

Well many people would say this trip is dangerous. For instance in the article, paragraph number seven it states that,""He slid down a slippery ladder on his backside."" This piece of information could be why people think this trip is to dangerous.

From the previous examples I think that is why you should go this trip. Rember this trip is not for realaxing, but for a learning, and hard working, once in a lifetime experince. Also rember that you can still have fun while working. ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

One major example of this is in the healthcare industry; the advancements of technology have allowed medical professionals to deliver treatments with a greater level of accuracy, speed and efficiency than ever before. For example, the use of automated machines for patient diagnostics, and surgical robots, has allowed for a more precise and detailed diagnosis compared to older traditional methods. This, in turn, not only saves critical time and resources but also provides a better standard of care for patients worldwide.

BA991FE296BD,"Cell Phones and Driving

Cell phone use while driving is one of those hot-button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cell phone. When notifications sound, kids my age and many adults have now been conditioned to immediately engage. Our engrained Pavlov's dog reaction doesn't stop just because we are at the wheel.. Whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity gets the better of them and they feel they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It doesn't matter how good you are at multitasking. It should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are a few reasons for that.

Let's start with texts, social media, and any other alert. To stop and read this alert you would have to take your eyes off the road for longer than the recommended time of one second, it takes to check the rear-view mirror. It is extremely dangerous to text or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your life you are risking. We endanger every one of our passengers and anybody we are sharing the road with.

As for making phone calls, this to should be banned. I do understand that sometimes your spouse may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home, or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case just pull over to the side of the road, take the call, then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason for you to pick up your phone while you're driving.

Whatever it is can almost certainly wait until you get where you're going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many lives to tweets or texts if people are under the threat of losing their license, steep fines, or if they truly think about the potential consequences.

Although many people believe distance learning from home is the most helpful way of learning because it better fits the busy schedules of children, learning in school is much more beneficial because children get the opportunity to learn and interact with others, students will not become dependent on technology, and kids will adapt to necessary time management skills.

To begin with, school may not be the most exciting time of the day, but it teaches many life skills used regularly. In the classrooms, students work together in teams to complete tasks and share ideas. Whether somebody is working in a job or purchasing something from the store, these necessary interaction skills are all taught in the early years of school. For example, if somebody completed their schooling online and was ready to go off to college, they would have a tough time getting around due to the fact that they have had no prior communication with other students. Completing school inside the classroom relieves stress from students who might be struggling on something while working alone online. Students who take advantage of learning in class together will learn important interaction and communication skills.

In addition, technology is increasingly becoming a part of everyday life for people all over the world. Children everywhere are being influenced by their screen, preventing them from focusing on the task at hand. In order for kids to stay kids, they must physically stay in school and not take online courses from home. While many kids are becoming well rounded and physically active with each other, some children are stuck at home taking online school through their computers. For example, the children in school will learn to do things on their own using their heads without having to rely on technology. Students who only interact with people through their screens will become more and more dependent on technology which can cause many problems down the road.

Last but not least, time management is one of the most important skills for people to have no matter what age they might be. The whole world is running on a strict schedule every hour of the day. When students attend classes in school, they get up on time, get themselves ready, and learn how to balance their busy schedules. Learning how to manage time at a young age is no easy task; however, students can master their skills by physically taking classes in school and preparing for life ahead. Children who take online school courses will struggle in the future to balance their time and live a life full of stress.

In conclusion, learning in school is much more beneficial for children because they get the chance to interact and communicate with others, they will not become reliant on technology alone, and they will learn necessary time management skills to be used everyday. When every child is enrolled into their school for class, they will be ready for the future and prepared for anything that life might throw their way. On the other hand, if children remain in online courses, they will struggle communicating with other people throughout their entire lives. Every student should be physically put into school to ensure a great future at this very moment.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
B106E3896C56,"Hey there!  So, I'm gonna write this essay about Emerson's quote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already done, you are not going to find out what you are capable of."" 

First off, I totally agree with Emerson because, like, if you don't push yourself to do new things, you'll never know how awesome you can be.  For instance, I used to be really into drawing, but I never thought I could actually paint. So, I took a risk and tried it out, and it turned out to be super fun!  Now, I'm actually pretty good at it. 

Another reason I agree with Emerson is that, if you don't try new things, you'll miss out on so many opportunities. Like, there are so many cool clubs and activities in school, but I never tried them out because I thought I wouldn't be good at them.  But then, I saw some of my friends having a blast at a club meeting, and I was like, ""Dang, I'm missing out!""  So, I decided to give it a shot, and now I'm the president of the club!  It's been super fun and has taught me so much. 

Lastly, trying something beyond what you have already done can help you discover your true potential. Like, I never thought I could be a good public speaker, but then I had to give a presentation in front of the whole class, and it turned out to be way easier than I thought!  Now, I'm actually pretty confident in my speaking skills, and I'm even thinking about joining the debate team. 

So, the impact of trying something beyond what you have already done is that it can help you find out what you're truly capable of, open up new opportunities, and help you discover your true potential.  It's like, if you don't take risks and try new things, you'll never know what you're missing out on.",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

llama_70b_v1770,"When peoples ask for advices, they somtimes talks to more than one person. This is a good idear because it can helps them make a beter choise.

First of all, when you talks to more than one person, you gets more infomation. For example, if you wants to know what movie to watch, you can asks your friends and family members. They might have seen diffrent movies and can tell you what they like and dislike about them. This way, you can pick the movie that sounds the most intresting to you.

Another reason why seeking multiplie opinions can help is that it can give you diffrent perspectives. Like, if you're trying to decide if you should get a dog, you can asks your parents, your friends, and even a pet experts. They all might have diffrent ideas about what kind of dog you should get and how to take care of it. This way, you can make a more informed desicion.

Lastly, seeking multiplie opinions can also helps you to avoid making a mistake. For example, if you're thinking about buying a new videogame, you can asks your friends if they have it and if it's any good. If they all say it's not that great, you might want to think twice before buying it.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can helps you make a better choise because it gives you more infomation, diffrent perspectives, and helps you avoid making a mistake.

EF3A72193AAF,"Winston Churchill was a British politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World War II. Churchill's life was marked by many challenges and setbacks, but he was able to overcome them and achieve great success. In this essay, I will analyze Churchill's quote ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" and describe a personal experience where I had to overcome obstacles to reach success. Additionally, I will discuss different strategies to be successful, including working hard, keeping a positive attitude, solving problems, trying your best, and learning something new.

Churchill's quote highlights the importance of perseverance and resilience in achieving success. It suggests that success is not just about achieving a specific goal, but also about maintaining a positive attitude and enthusiasm even in the face of failure. Churchill's own life is a perfect example of this. He faced many challenges throughout his career, including losing his first election and being defeated in several others. However, he never lost his enthusiasm and continued to work hard towards his goals.

One personal experience where I had to overcome obstacles to reach success was when I was trying to improve my grades in a particularly challenging class. I struggled to understand the material and often found myself falling behind. However, instead of giving up, I sought help from my teacher and classmates. I also made a conscious effort to study regularly and practice the material outside of class. Despite the initial challenges, I was able to improve my grades and achieve success in the class.

To be successful, it is important to have a combination of different strategies. One of the most important is working hard. Success rarely comes easy, and it takes dedication and effort to achieve your goals. This means setting aside time to study, practice, and work towards your goals. Additionally, it is important to have a positive attitude. A positive attitude can help you overcome obstacles and stay motivated even in the face of failure. This means focusing on the positive aspects of a situation and looking for ways to improve.

Solving problems is also an important strategy for success. In any field, there will be challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome. To be successful, you need to be able to identify these problems and come up with solutions. This means thinking creatively and outside the box to find new ways to approach a problem.

F44AE6192EA9,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that expanding your skills beyond what you have already mastered is of utmost importance. While it may be tempting to rely on your current abilities, doing so can limit your potential and prevent you from achieving your full potential. In this essay, I will argue that expanding your skills is essential for personal and professional growth, and provide examples of how it has benefited me in the past.

Firstly, expanding your skills can lead to personal growth. When you learn something new, you are challenging yourself to think outside the box and to think differently. This can help you develop a growth mindset, which is the belief that your abilities can be developed through hard work and dedication. By constantly pushing yourself to learn new things, you are demonstrating your commitment to self-improvement and personal development.

For example, when I first started learning to play the guitar, I was hesitant and unsure of myself. However, as I continued to practice and learn new songs, I began to see improvements in my playing and my confidence grew. Not only did I become a better musician, but I also developed a greater sense of self-worth and self-esteem.

Secondly, expanding your skills can be beneficial in a professional setting. In today's job market, employers are looking for candidates who are adaptable and able to learn quickly. By continuously expanding your skills, you are demonstrating your ability to adapt to new situations and take on new challenges. This can make you a valuable asset to any organization and increase your chances of success in your career.

For instance, when I first started working in the marketing department at my internship, I had little experience with social media management. However, I quickly realized that this was an area where I could learn and grow. I began to research and learn about different social media platforms and strategies, and I started implementing them in my work. As a result, I was able to increase the company's social media following and engagement, which ultimately led to more business and revenue.

In conclusion, expanding your skills beyond what you have already mastered is essential for personal and professional growth. By constantly challenging yourself to learn new things, you are demonstrating your commitment to self-improvement and personal development. Additionally, by expanding your skills in a professional setting, you are increasing your value as an employee and your chances of success",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,7
C4A208FC02D2," Can a positive mindset lead you to the life you've always wanted? There are countless reasons to believe that a positive attitude is the key to achieving success in life. When we have a positive mindset, we become more capable of making smart decisions. For example, a negative person would never take a risk to make a difficult decision because they would always assume that everything would turn out poorly. However, a positive person would never give up and would always keep trying to achieve their goals, no matter what negative comments they receive from others.

A positive attitude brings happiness to our lives, making us feel like superheroes with superpowers. Many successful people, such as actors, singers, entrepreneurs, and others, recommend maintaining a positive mindset even during tough times. This is because a positive attitude can help us overcome obstacles and achieve our dreams.

One of the reasons a positive attitude is essential is that it helps us make better decisions. When we have a positive mindset, we are more likely to take risks and make difficult decisions. This is because we believe that everything will work out in the end. On the other hand, a negative person would always assume the worst and would never take risks, which could limit their potential for success.

Another reason a positive attitude is crucial is that it helps us overcome setbacks and failures. When we have a positive mindset, we are more likely to keep trying and not give up. This is because we believe that we can achieve anything we set our minds to. In contrast, a negative person would give up easily and would never try again.

In conclusion, a positive attitude is essential for achieving success in life. It helps us make better decisions, overcome setbacks and failures, and brings happiness to our lives. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a positive mindset and to never give up on our dreams.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

B9BA0955819D,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that older students can greatly benefit younger students with school work. By working together, older students can help younger students develop valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.

One way that older students can help younger students is by pairing up with them for group projects. By working together, older students can provide guidance and support to younger students, helping them to develop their skills and confidence. This can be especially beneficial for younger students who may struggle with certain subjects or tasks, as older students can offer additional perspectives and resources to help them succeed.

In addition to working together on group projects, older students can also provide valuable advice to younger students when they need it. Whether it's offering tips on how to study for exams or providing guidance on how to navigate the social landscape of school, older students can offer valuable insights and support to younger students. This can be especially beneficial for younger students who may be new to the school or who may be struggling to find their place in the community.

D5C8C29F17D8,"As an 8th grader, I have often wondered about the benefits of attending school versus completing schoolwork at home. While some students may prefer the comfort of their own homes, others may thrive in a structured school environment. After conducting research and exploring different options available for students who cannot attend school, I have come to realize that both scenarios have their own advantages and disadvantages.

On one hand, attending school provides students with a social atmosphere that can enhance their learning experience. Being around peers and teachers can stimulate discussion and collaboration, which can lead to better understanding and retention of material. Additionally, schools often offer various extracurricular activities and clubs that can help students develop their interests and talents. For example, joining a sports team or music club can help students develop teamwork and leadership skills, respectively.

On the other hand, completing schoolwork at home can offer students more flexibility and autonomy in their learning. Students can work at their own pace and take breaks whenever they need to, which can be especially helpful for those who have different learning styles or have difficulty concentrating in a classroom setting. Moreover, students can access online resources and tools that can provide personalized learning experiences tailored to their needs.

For students who cannot attend school due to various reasons, such as illness or disability, there are different options available. Online schools and homeschooling programs can provide a structured learning environment that is tailored to the individual student's needs. These programs can offer flexibility and personalized attention that may not be possible in a traditional classroom setting.

However, there are also major differences between attending school and completing schoolwork at home. In a classroom setting, students can receive immediate feedback and support from teachers, which can help them stay on track with their education. Additionally, teachers can provide real-time feedback and guidance, which can help students improve their understanding and performance. In contrast, completing schoolwork at home can be more isolating, and students may struggle to stay motivated and focused without the structure and support of a classroom environment.

Despite these differences, there are ways that students can stay on track with their education if they are completing schoolwork at home. For example, setting a schedule and creating a conducive learning environment can help students stay organized and focused",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

1C088E6CD17E,"As society becomes more reliant on technological advances, many individuals are now granted the opportunity to take online classes at home. Essentially, school systems have modernized their methods of providing various approaches towards an efficient education. Although virtual learning provides a more personalized learning experience for students, the consequences of implementing online classes outweigh the benefits.

Online classes can hinder the development of social skills within individuals. The classroom setting and environment offers students a wide variety of ways to exercise their social skills and develop character by interacting with different individuals. For an example, many individuals who are confined inside their homes are unable to participate in healthy activities that involve engaging with other students such as sports, clubs, organizations, and other extracurricular activities. Oftentimes, the individual who finds themselves being accustomed to this way of learning have identified themselves as ""anti-social"" or socially awkward. This is due to the fact that they prefer to isolate themselves from group settings or from social events because they are apprehensive and, sometimes even, hostile towards others who attempt to change their habits. Some may argue that online classes have the ability to engage its students with insightful discussions with their teacher and peers online. However, physical presence plays a vital role in developing relationships and allowing students to overcome their social anxiety. Like any technological application, individuals typically use online platforms and sites to display a persona and in this case, online classes encourages these students to strengthen their online presence, but not their physical one. In terms of longevity, this method does not strengthen crucial life and work skills that they are expected to have when they join the workforce; it is simply unrealistic. These students are encouraged to hide behind a screen because they lack social skills, and they justify this practice because the education system glamorizes the idea of their innovative society. Overall, online classes not only affect their learning experience, but their social skills.

Furthermore, online classes are not preparing individuals to face the reality of the workforce and the legitimacy of this method is ambiguous. The whole purpose of providing the youth with education is to be able to train them to become independent enough to be self-sufficient in the real world. In a school or classroom environment, they learn valuable teamwork skills that allow them to cooperate and collaborate with other individuals about how to approach an issue, overcome challenges, and propose a solution. This eventually leads to the building of bonds and relationships that could impact an individual's life or mental health, whereas online schooling encourages the opposite effect of this. By physically going to school, these individuals nurture their abilities to be problem-solvers and natural thinkers. Additionally, some students may not take online classes seriously as opposed to physically showing up for class. For an example, online students may not require a time constraint and does not require the students to be properly dressed for the ""class."" Sometimes, the individual may present themselves to an online class in their pajamas because they woke up an hour ago. This does not exemplify sophistication nor does the class seem respected. On the other hand, if the student were to show up to school, they would look much more prepared and willing to learn. This highlights the difference between individuals who value their education and the ones who do not.

Lastly, online schooling does not account for individuals with learning disabilities. Most schools consist of people from various races, ethnicities, backgrounds, sexes, and learning capabilities. Not every student thinks the same way, so they should be encouraged to express their creativity to establish a diverse school setting. Additionally, some students may possess specific learning disabilities such as ADHD, dyslexia, autism, mental illnesses, and more. In this case, these students require much more attention from their teachers to help guide them through this process, but an online class can only do so much. The teachers may be going at a faster pace than what these students can normally handle or they are confused about a certain area of the subject, so their frustrations may build up and lead to detrimental effects on their mental health. Although it is considered to be personalized learning, these individuals require careful guidance towards achieving the same success that their counterparts are experiencing. In the sense of virtual learning, these individuals are at a disadvantage because their learning disabilities are beyond their control. Video conferencing may be an option, but students with learning disabilities prefer not to share with their peers that they are struggling in a certain area or having difficulties understanding the curriculum, but would much rather keep this information confidential between themselves and their teachers.

By implementing online classes, schools should reassess the validity of its efficiency and the impact it will have on students. Virtual learning can have benefits, but is effective to a certain extent. Ultimately, the negative imbalance between the consequences and benefits of virtual learning suggests that online classes should not be encouraged within school systems and to continue to maintain a traditional form of education. ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

First of all, let's talk about why we should even have a debate about the menu. 🤔 Like, think about it – the cafeteria food is like, a big part of our school experience, right? 🍔🥤 It's where we go to hang out with our friends, grab a quick bite, and refuel for class.

I am an 8th grade student who is interested in pursuing a career in law enforcement. I have been researching different careers in the police force and have come to the conclusion that it is the career that I am most passionate about.

One of the reasons why I am interested in the police force is because of the important role that they play in maintaining public safety. Police officers are responsible for protecting the community and ensuring that the law is upheld. They put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe and I find that to be incredibly brave and admirable.

In addition to my research, I have also been attending criminology classes to learn more about the field. These classes have taught me about the different types of crimes that exist, the ways in which they are investigated, and the different strategies that law enforcement agencies use to prevent them. I find this information to be fascinating and I am eager to learn more.

I would like to express my interest in visiting your police force to learn more about the day-to-day operations and to gain a better understanding of the role that police officers play in the community.

DECECA25BCBD,"Not everyone learns the same way and because of that not every class should be taught the same way. Since schools were designed to educate people of all backgrounds it should also be designed to teach various subjects in different manners that would ensure a better learning environment. Because of this it's better to have a versatile school system that offers a variety of ways for a subject to be taught. Allowing the option of online classes could help ensure that students are able to learn in an environment that proves to be more beneficial to them. By having the option of online classes it could help benefit students because it's, increases time management skills, is more accommodating to their schedules, and it's less overwhelming than a traditional class.

Taking online classes would help to instill necessary time management skills that could help ensure a more productive present and future. Some students have a lot on their plate that he or she struggles to keep up with, so school tends to become an issue as they can no longer keep it all balanced. Having the option of online schools help them create a balance that wasn't there before so they're able to remain on track with all their goals. However, allowing a student to take online classes doesn't mean they're able to sit at home doing anything, but what it does mean is that the student will be help responsible for keeping up with their work as they progress through the curriculum. By being able to remain responsible and keep up with one's work it proves that he or she will be better prepared for adulthood and the future. Some question what would happen if the student doesn't time manage, but this is why he or she must fully evaluate if online classes would prove to be more beneficial to them.

Whether a student chose to take one online class or several, it would prove to be much more accommodating to students' schedules because it enables them to fit their classwork and lessons into their schedule versus having a predetermined schedule they can't keep up with. Not all students are able to focus on school alone because they have other things that require their attention. Things like jobs or more private things can occupy a permanent time period in one's life and cause constant conflicts with school, but by allowing students to take online classes it helps take away the stress of having to chose which necessity will receive their attention. Yet some still believe that school should be a student's only focus, but in some cases it's just not possible and by giving them the chance to create a schedule that works for them it helps better prepare them for the future.

By being removed from a traditional learning environment that a classroom provides, it also removes the sense of being overwhelmed and anxious that one can get from the stressors it permits. Other students, and in some cases teachers, can create a barrier between a student and learning simply because they've created an environment that makes a student feel he or she is unable to fully focus and get involved in the subject. When this happens the likelihood that a student will be successful in a course greatly decreases. By removing him or her from this environment it destroys that barrier and creates a new space where he or she is now able to learn without any interrupters. Some say that the sense of being overwhelmed can still occur if one isn't able to keep up with their work, but by using time management skills he or she should be able to truly excel.

Students today are the leaders of tomorrow and because of that they should all be given each and every opportunity to excel. At no point in time should a student be denied something that would help them be more progressive in their track to graduating. By allowing schools to provide a versatile way of teaching materials, we guarantee to students that they're the first priority when in school, and that their needs are just as important as others wants. By taking a stand today and helping students everywhere be able to learn as they see best fit, the world is ensuring a better world for future generations to come. The world deserves a better future and that starts by allowing students to have a better one.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

7504FC6D03BD,"Cars are not something that have to be used everyday. Limiting car usage could be a good thing to do. Minimizing car usage gives you the opportunity to have more parks and fun places to go without the parking lot taking up all the space.

Less space for parking makes everything more easier to get to which is an advantage instead of having to walk in the parking lot . For example, "" . . . make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6 ). This explains that if you get rid of the cars theres more space to park and everything else becomes easier to get to versus having many parking spaces taking up room and causing traffic and other things. Also with not using cars theres more room for small stores and big stores to be put in different places that couldnt be put there because of cars so you could drive. For example, "" . . . stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6 ) and "" Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour retsrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky, Paragraph 28). This shows that now there's more spaces for even more stores which is an advantage because the cars used to take up that space used for bigger roads for more cars to come on but without that problem theres room for other thing's.

Also it's a good way to save money because it decreases smog, and air polllution. For example, "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" ( Paris bans driving due to smog, Robert Duffer, Paragraph 14).  This shows that after France decided to stop using cars the smog decreased tremendisely. Having no vehicles can also make the environment better because there wouldnt be a lot of carbon being produced. For example, "" . . . it will have a benificial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" ( The End of Car Culture, Elisabeth Rosentha, Paragraph 34). Which is an example of how it could better for the environment. An advantage also is there will be less pollution. For example, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution . . ."" This explains that it would be a good thing for us , we would have better breathing and also again a better environment .

In Conclusion, Minimizing driving usage could lead to better things such as less pollution, a better environment , and lastly more room for other things . So theyre are many advantages to minimizing driving usage, it's not so bad.                            ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
E312449DF480,"I think, first impressions are more effected than other events. Because first reactions are usually hectic. We will not know until we feel something. Somehow, recollections can give you positive or negative effects. If a person had a bad impression, it can gives you anxiety, which is a person needs to get help about negative satiation. It doesn't matter how bad or how good the impressions are, it is important how people get effect.

Second, I remember when I was first grade in elementary school, I did not want to go to the school. It was the first day I wanted to stay at home. On that day, I was a little bit bored, I took the big pillows from armchairs then put them together. I was trying to jump from the pillows to the other sofa. The first time I jumped it was successful. After a moment my mom caught me. I was kind of scared, she told me it was dangerous, and I can hurt myself with that.

After she left, I put the pillows together like I did it before, then I jumped to the wall. The walls corner was really sharp, and I hit to the wall. I realized I hurt my self so bad. Then I went to my mom, I was holding my head and crying. She was so mad at me, then I took my hands off from my head, it was bleeding so much. She called my dad, then we went to the hospital.

95CB51270760,"Honestly I think they shouldn't change the Electoral College. I have three reasons why they shouldn't change the Electoral College. This Electoral College has made this nation historical,it would be too much work to change it,and it wouldn't be the same if they changed it.

Changing this Electoral College wouldn't be the best thing to do cause it's made this nation have so many historical moments. We had so many presidents that changed this nation. George Washington was probably the most remembered president. Washington fought for our country in wars that happened long ago. He made this country have so much meaning to it.

Another reason why they shouldn't change the Electoral College is because it would be too much work. It would seem very tiring to change the Electoral College. There are so many rules and amendments that they would have to change. They would also have to change the number of votes that the president has to get. I think it would be better if they left the Electoral College the way it is.

The last reason why they shouldn't change the Electoral College is because it wouldn't be the same. There are so many great Amendments that should remain the same. It would be chaos if they changed the Amendments. Plus a lot of people would have even more opinions about why they changed the Electoral College. The Electoral College should remain the same.

925d0537,"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage 

Limiting car usage can lead to numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. The idea of reducing car dependence is gaining traction worldwide, as seen in examples from Germany, France, and Colombia. By implementing measures like car-free districts, driving bans, and car-free days, these countries have successfully reduced greenhouse gas emissions, decreased traffic congestion, and improved overall quality of life. These examples demonstrate the potential benefits of limiting car usage, including increased physical activity, improved air quality, and the promotion of sustainable and accessible transportation options.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity and improved health. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is discouraged and alternative transportation options are emphasized, 70% of families do not own cars. This means that residents rely on walking, biking, or public transportation to meet their daily needs. This change in behavior has led to increased physical activity, which in turn promotes better health and well-being. Moreover, car-free districts like Vauban create spaces where people can walk and bike safely, leading to a more active lifestyle for residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. According to a study mentioned in the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By implementing measures such as driving bans in Paris and car-free days in Bogota, cities are able to address the issue of air pollution caused by cars. These temporary restrictions on car usage result in decreased traffic congestion and reduced emissions, leading to cleaner air and a healthier environment for residents.

In addition, limiting car usage can contribute to the promotion of sustainable and accessible transportation options. The development of car-free districts, like Vauban in Germany, encourages the placement of essential amenities, such as stores and services, within walking or biking distance. This concept of ""smart planning"" aims to create more compact and accessible suburban communities, reducing the need for long-distance car trips. By providing alternatives to car ownership and promoting public transportation, these communities become more sustainable and accessible to all residents, including those who do not own cars.

While limiting car usage may seem challenging in areas where car culture is deeply ingrained, there is evidence to suggest that the trend of reduced car ownership and driving is already occurring in some regions. Research indicates that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This shift in behavior has been observed in various age groups, including young adults and older individuals. Factors such as the rise of digital connectivity, the renewal of city centers, and the availability of car-sharing programs have contributed to the decrease in car dependency. With ongoing changes in behavior and attitudes toward car ownership, it is possible that the trend of reduced car usage will continue, bringing along with it the associated benefits of reduced emissions and increased accessibility.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers various advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. Examples from Germany, France, and Colombia demonstrate the positive outcomes of measures such as car-free districts, driving bans, and car-free days. These initiatives promote physical activity, improve air quality, and enhance access to sustainable transportation options. Additionally, trends in reduced car ownership and driving suggest that limiting car usage is not only feasible but also desirable in the pursuit of a more sustainable and accessible future. It is imperative that individuals, communities, and policymakers continue to explore and implement strategies that promote a reduced reliance on cars and encourage alternative modes of transportation.",1,radek_500,,4
BB8064D7B327," My friend is home schooled because she was being bullied at school and couldn't handle it anymore. Her counselor suggested online classes as an alternative to dropping out, and my friend was able to graduate with good grades and a bright future. Online classes are a great option for students who face challenges at school, those who want to drop out, and those who want a more flexible and convenient learning experience.

The primary benefit of online classes is that they can help students who face challenges at school. For example, if you are constantly being bullied, harassed, or have problems with your teachers, online classes can provide a safe and supportive learning environment. They can help you stay out of trouble and improve your grades, ultimately leading to a successful graduation. If you are struggling with your school situation, it's important to talk to your counselor or parents about the possibility of online classes.

Secondly, online classes can benefit students who are planning to drop out of school. Financial reasons, such as wanting to help their families or facing unexpected expenses, can often lead to dropping out. Online classes can provide an opportunity for these students to continue their education and potentially improve their job prospects. It can also give them the confidence to finish their schooling and achieve their goals. I remember a student at my school counseling aide who was considering dropping out because they wanted to help their family. They were upset but didn't know that online classes were an option. When we explained the possibility, they were overjoyed and grateful for the opportunity to continue their education.

Finally, online classes are easier and quicker than traditional classroom learning. They allow students to take classes at their own pace and on their own schedule. This can be especially beneficial for students who have other responsibilities, such as jobs or families, that make it difficult to attend traditional classes. Online classes can also be less stressful than traditional classroom learning, as there is less pressure to keep up with deadlines and assignments. This can help students feel more relaxed and focused on their studies.

In conclusion, online classes can be a great benefit for students who face challenges at school, those who want to drop out, and those who want a more flexible and convenient learning experience. They can help students improve their grades, achieve their goals, and reduce stress. If you are struggling with your school situation or considering dropping out, it's important to talk to your counsel",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

DF8B648769C5,"In today's society, it is essential to have the ability to influence others positively. This can be done through various means, including examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice. In this essay, I will analyze the effectiveness of these methods and provide evidence to support my argument.

One of the most powerful ways to influence others positively is through examples. People are often more likely to follow the actions of those they admire or respect. For instance, a teacher who consistently demonstrates a positive attitude and work ethic can inspire their students to do the same. A study conducted by the University of Michigan found that students who had a positive role model were more likely to achieve academic success and engage in prosocial behavior (Kurtz & Algoe, 2015).

Another effective method of influencing others positively is through actions. People often judge others based on their behavior, and taking positive actions can have a significant impact. For example, volunteering at a local charity or participating in a community event can demonstrate a commitment to helping others and inspire others to do the same. A study by the University of Pennsylvania found that people who engaged in prosocial behavior were more likely to be perceived as kind and compassionate by others (Dunn, 2008).

Reasons are also an effective way to influence others positively. When people understand the benefits of a particular behavior or action, they are more likely to adopt it. For example, explaining the health benefits of exercising regularly can motivate others to start an exercise routine. A study by the American Heart Association found that people who received information about the benefits of exercise were more likely to engage in regular physical activity (Hillman & Tate, 2009).

Finally, personal advice can be a powerful tool for influencing others positively. People often seek advice from those they trust and respect, and taking their advice into consideration can lead to positive changes. For example, a friend who has successfully navigated a difficult situation can offer valuable advice to someone going through a similar experience. A study by the University of California, Los Angeles found that people who received advice from others were more likely to engage in positive behaviors and achieve their goals (Rogers & Fazio, 1989).

In conclusion, examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice are all effective methods for influencing others positively.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,8
CD7BA9FDE486,"The electorial college is one of the worst things to happen to america. there are so many reasons why but i will just give you three. It does not allow us to vote for president anymore. It's a lazy system. The voters have a right to pick yet it's not up to use it's up anyone who is not in office. The electorial system has just to may flaws.

The first reason is it doesn't alow us to vote for president anymore. The goverment has someone high in power of each state deside even if it's not true its who they want and how they want it. The electorial vote was created by some people high in power. Richard Nixon Jimmy Carter Bob Dole The U.S.A. chamber of commerce the CIO AFL all created the electorial vote mind you that all were know for bad ideas.

The second reason is It's a lazy system. Before some had to count all votes now no on has to count them the leaders of the states do it for them they pick who they feel and thats it. At any point in time there could be a tie because there is an even number of voters. Someone could even lows there presedince even if he gets the most votes.

The third and final reason is the reason that we use the electorial vote. We use it because its cheaper that way. The government wont tell u but its a cheaper way of voting. They know that if we use there way the money will come out of our pockets not theres so the have us use this way in stead.

Well there you have it there is why an electorial vote is bad. I will give them this it is easier. But still there are so many reasons why its bad. We dont even vote anymore the leader of a state does. Its lazy and bab for either candidate. The electorial vote has been and will always be a bad way to vote and a bad thing for America and its history.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
8805BDE4E251,"If the principal decided that all students must do one extracurricular activity, I would most likely agree with it because I think it's good to get out the house and try new things. I think it would also help with making new friends and meeting new people. It could help them stay active and make them feel good about them self and could put them in a happier place and stands. And

They could find something they really enjoy doing.

There is a little part of me that makes me disagree a little. At home they could have a ruff home life so they have no ride home, their parents don't support them so they would not help out of come to there games or to the meetings for the activity, and they could not be able to get the stuff they need for that sport. I would say sports has really helped me make new friends and become a better person and stay active and fit.

But for me I would have to go with agree because I think it is good for kids to stay active,to get out and ex- prole new things, make new friends, meet new people , staying active, and staying in shape. That could also mean that is there time to get away from everything like maybe something happening at home and they need a break or maybe they are getting bullied so that is there set away from everything. so I think I would say I am gonna go with agree.       ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

60FD2E2FB768,"As an 8th grader, I think adding an extra hour and a half to the school day would have both positive and negative effects on students, teachers, and their families.

On the one hand, having more time in school could be beneficial for students. We could finish our coursework more quickly and have more time to ask questions and get help from teachers. This could lead to better grades and a more solid understanding of the material. Additionally, we could have more time for extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, or clubs, which could help us develop new skills and make new friends.

On the other hand, adding an extra hour and a half to the school day could be challenging for students and their families. Many students have after-school jobs or other commitments, such as sports practices or tutoring, that could conflict with the extended school day. This could make it difficult for them to get to school on time or make it home in time for dinner and other activities. Moreover, the extra time in school could lead to fatigue and stress for students, which could negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being.

Teachers could also be affected by an extended school day. They might have to stay late to grade papers or prepare lessons, which could be time-consuming and exhausting. This could lead to burnout and decreased motivation, which could negatively impact the quality of education provided to students.

However, there are also potential benefits to adding an extra hour and a half to the school day. For example, students could have more time to work on projects or collaborate with their peers on group assignments. This could help them develop important skills, such as time management, teamwork, and problem-solving. Additionally, the extra time in school could provide more opportunities for students to receive individualized attention and support from teachers, which could help them overcome challenges and achieve their academic goals.

In conclusion, while adding an extra hour and a half to the school day could have both positive and negative effects, I believe that the benefits could outweigh the drawbacks.

674F5DA988D2,"Curfews have been a topic of debate for many years, with some people arguing that they are necessary to keep teenagers safe, while others believe that they can have negative effects on their development and the community as a whole. In this essay, I will explore the effects of curfews on teenagers and their communities, and discuss the pros and cons of imposing curfews in cities.

On the one hand, curfews can have positive effects on teenagers and their communities. By setting a specific time for teenagers to return home, curfews can help to reduce the number of teenagers who engage in risky behaviors such as drug use, alcohol consumption, and violence. Curfews can also help to improve the safety of the community by reducing the number of teenagers who are out late at night, which can make them more vulnerable to crime and other dangers.

However, there are also many negative effects of curfews on teenagers and their communities. One of the biggest concerns is that curfews can restrict the freedom and autonomy of teenagers, which can have long-term negative effects on their development. Teenagers who are forced to come home at a specific time may feel like they are being punished or restricted, which can lead to feelings of resentment and rebellion. Additionally, curfews can have a negative impact on the community as a whole, as they can limit the number of teenagers who are out and about, which can lead to a decrease in foot traffic and a decline in local businesses.

In conclusion, the effects of curfews on teenagers and their communities are complex and multifaceted. While curfews can have positive effects on teenagers and their communities, they can also have negative effects that must be carefully considered. Ultimately, the decision to impose curfews in cities should be based on a careful analysis of the potential benefits and drawbacks, and should be made with the best interests of the community in mind.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,7
43A4DCBC26BB,"Imagine if all students participated in an extracurricular activity. That's a crazy thought, but also a very intelligent one. A huge population of students do go to after school clubs and sports, but what about the ones who don't because they are to shy and don't have many friends. If the principal is making all students participate in after school activities it will be an excellent idea because, students will find new friends, the clubs will keep students active and off their phones, and they can learn new things and experience new activities.

First off, since all students have to participate in after school clubs then they can make new friends. If they see someone not talking to anyone then they can go over and introduce themselves. Students will also be able to hangout with friends they already have. This would be really awesome for kids who are shy. Having to do a club will get them out of their comfort zone and push them to make new friends. The next thing is, getting to go to these activities will keep students active and off their phones. Most adults would say students are like bears in hibernation. Once they go into their rooms they don't come out unless they need food. Now students won't be sitting inside they will be able to get out of the house. No phones will be allowed so students won't have their eyes glued to the screen for any longer than they should. This idea will also keep students thinking about other things than social media. They won't have time to worry about if their new post got more likes than their friends post. Lastly, they can learn and experience new things. In sports they can learn to cooperate with a team, and work on their sportsman ship. Having to do a club will also help students find new interests. They could do a Science club and realize how much they love it when they see something explode into a puff of air with a big popping sound, or when an experiment makes a massive sticky and disgusting mess. Having to do a club will also help students learn more about working. Instead of sitting at home having their parents do everything for them, they will learn how to do it themselves.

In conclusion, if the principal is making all students participate in an after school activity it's going be a grand idea because, students will make new friends, they will be active and away from their phones, and they will be able to learn and experience new activities. Not every student is going to agree with this because they would rather play on their phone or computer, but if the principal really enforces this idea then it will happen. A flaw in this plan is that students might not show up and never come to any of the meetings and activities. Yes this is something that could be an issue, but if the teachers in charge of the clubs gave out consequences for students who continued to skip every meeting without an excused absence, than this will work. Now that our principal is really making this happen, our school will become a better place.         ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
B7E3734CD1FA,"Limiting the usage of cars has a varirty of advantages. From having a less expensive life, to less air pollution, and overall a generally happier life. Thinking about all the excess and stress that comes with owning a car is tiring. Not to mention the hazardous effect it had on our lives. Would it not be nice to just take off some of that burden off of you, and be a happier person?.Let me help you out on how to achieve that.

Owning a car is pricey! In Freiburg along with paying for your house you also have to pay for a parking garage, which comes with a hefty price. Did i not mention the distance you have to walk to park? lets just say you might as well have taken the bus.""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park---large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.""(source one,section two). With you alone driving to work and back everyday will tally up to over a hundred dollars spent every week, now add children into it, and their after school ativities, also add emergencies. See where this is going? sure you might need a car now and then, having a car is not a bad thing. How about Carpooling? It will reduce that price you have on your gas recipts and create more time for bonding and interacting with people.

Health or driving? Well if you are not healthy you can not drive can you? With all of the automobiles we have today it is bound to affect the earth. The smog in the air leading to that first cough that can lead to something more terminal. Imagine what it would be like if you had less cars, or even no cars at all! well the capital of France tried it and the results were amazing.""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..""(source two,section fourteen).  Now think about if that ban that Paris enforced,was tried out in other countries. Just that little change in the amount of cars on the road let to that difference of the pollution. Probably led to a difference in someones health too.

Everything stated above leads to happiness, from the less expences that will have to be paid, and the less damage that the pollution will have on your health. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter""source one, section three).Also when there are less cars on the road your community will be able to connect more and have better infranstructure, which would make them  happy just like it did for the people of Bogata, Columbia.""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks;rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up.""(source three,section twenty-eight).

Overall the advantages of limiting car usage has many benefits to it. From having a less expensive life, by not having to pay for gas so often, car insurance, and evrything else that comes with it. Having better health also is a advantage of the limitation of car usage. Also one of the most important aspects of life, happiness comes with the limitation of using cars. So there is no reason to not try it out, there will be more benefits.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

And the President that gets the most votes wins all [In most states] the electoral votes. Elecoral college is a great way to decide the President because having every one decide the President from popular votes is not fair because most people vote for what they hear from other people and if the others are voting for a President they are going to get more than one vote from one person. so having the Electoral College is the more fair way of deciding the votes.

People that are chosen are more cnoledgable and smarter to vote than people that vote just to say that they voted without looking and knowing why they voted for that President and not for the other. Because in the passage it says ""It is entierly possible that the winner of the electroal vote will not win the national popular votes"" and that suggests the point of this essay.

The Electoral College foucese more on all states than the popular votes. because big states like (Florida, texes, etc) have way more people than other states so if a state has 15 electoral votes and a diffrent state had 11 when the first state has double the amount of people in the second state. so that means that the President has to focuse on all the states so no state feels that their votes don't matter.

85983B2516C5,"While the idea of using a Facial Action Coding System in the educational process would certainly be interesting, I do not think it is nearly advanced enough to be able to be used in modern schools. While the technology may be able to find the hidden emotions behind the famous portrait Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, that does not mean it is in a position to help students learn. Simply put, the Facial Action Coding System does not have the viability, efficacy, or privacy needed in order to supplement learning.

Even if we allowed camera's to scan the faces of students in school, we would not be able to decode their emotions in a speed befiting our educational system today. At the seventh passage, the author states that, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting. Even if a school had the funds to buy a computer that could process the data quickly enough to be useful, there are simply too many students for that one computer to process, which would make the entire system useless.

If we were to simply put that first fact aside and instead look at the ability for this technology to assist students in an ideal setting, we still find that students can fake their emotions in order to cheat the system. In the third passage of the artice, the author states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,"" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities.

The idea of being able to find out the emotions of all of the chidlren in a school on a whim also rises privacy concerns that would need to be addressed before any program including this software would be implemented. The information gathered from students could be used for selfish purposes, as explained in the sixth passage of the article, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,"" showing that companies have use for this technology to better their businesses. If ad companies managed to get this emotional information from students all across the country, either from the government itself or through illegal actions, they could use that information to make new products and ads that would try to exploit the emotions of children. Because of this and the added concern of giving the information to the government itself, many parents would oppose a system that tracks and records the emotions of children.

Because of the lack of availablity, the potential cheating of the software, and the privacy concerns involved, the Facial Action Coding System is not able to be used in its current state to benefit schools. While this technology could be used in the future to help students, for example students with mental disabilities, it is not able to do so as it is now. It will be interesting to see what this and similar technologies grow to be, for better or for worse.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

Both of these jobs still don't pay enough for everything that you need, but you still go to school determined to go to college and get a good job. But then you find out that community service is required and you realize that you don't have enough time to be in school because of this new requirement. So your forced to get a fulltime job, that doesn't require a high school or college degree.

Kids who wish to and have time to do community service should do it, but it shouldn't be required off all kids to respect the difference in their lives, and the following reasons.

1. Public school is for all kids despite the situation at home, and their parents are the taxpayers supporting this school, there fore the school should respect every students home situation and not make an impossible requirement for kids who can't meet it.

2. If community service becomes a requirement, it is likely that more people will drop out of high school.

3. Kids who are in sports may have to sacrifice practices for community services, when sports can get kids into college's when otherwise they wouldn't be able to go.

In conclusion if there's a good amount of people interested in community service, then there should be an after school club, or perhaps an actual elective were you can do community service during school hours, so it wouldn't have to interfere with after school agenda. Having Required activities that take place after school hours is not fair to all students, therefore should remain a choice among students.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
204C6B729D8B,"In various educational systems across the country, students are required to complete summer projects that help them retain infromation they would have most likely forgotten if not for these projects. Not only this but it is an efficient way introduce new concepts students will likely see in the forecoming school year. This idea is of sound measure. Students are said to forget a significant amount of material they learned in school in just the few months they are out on break. But how can teachers really maximize their students' fullest potential? What can they do to assure that the students are learning in the most befitting way possible? The answer lies not in them but in their students. As teachers begin to conjure certain summer assignments, they should look to reach out to thier students for advice. Having student-designed summer projects should be used in lue of teacher-designed summer projects because it creates a learning enviroment that is not only efficient but specifically designed to maximize potential.

During the summer, the last thing that a student wants on their mind is to complete a summer assignment. And who can blame them? It is most likely not in anyones best interest to want to sit inside a house where work is waiting for them. However, if teachers can somehow make their assignments more interesting and incite active engadgemnt, then students can have the value of imrproving their cerebral capabilities in an enjoyable learning enviroment. There are numerous ways a teacher can get their student's input on a summer assignemnt. They can have a digital survey, one of the most commonly used tools to get basic information on a topic. This is a helpful strategy when just looking to improve the quality of an assignemnt, or get a taste of what might be expected. This strategy, however, is still very teacher oriented and lacks student control. If this is to broad and/or unfufilling, then teachers can avert to another method such as student drafts. This is where a student can individually submit a draft of a summer project by outlining their opinions and suggestions that may benefit all students. Here, a teacher can observe first hand what a student would see most appropriate for a summer assignemnt. This is still a very subjective method of student input; while the goal is to assure that all students are learning during the break, this particular student may not be speaking for everyone else. In other words, a poll may predict the general concensus of a majority but it still can be inaccurate and non-representative. Another, more objective strategy a teacher can use is what is called a class concensus. Here, the class (or any student body) organizes thier ideas together, to come to a final or multiple conclusions. This is not the most practical way but it is non-biased and very effective in a factor analysis situtation. This method is the most effective way to implement a student-designed summer project in the absence of bias and non-representation.

Teacher-designed summer projects can be counterintutive, as they fail to not only improve the compulsive tendencies prominent in these projects, but also lack incentives to promote active engadgment. In other words, the only way a student can activley learn is to provide a setting where they want to learn. To reinforce a point made earlier, it is summer time. No student will bow down and work for the sake of working; they need to be molded and guided into a mindset where they can put time aside to want to engadge in a summer assignemnt. While a student-designed summer project is the most effective way to assure continuous learning throughout the summer, it is ultimatley the teacher's job to be the enforcer, the head hunter. Students can be heavily influenced by the actions and tendencies of thier teachers. By what they do, what they say, how they talk to people, and so on and so forth. There is no absolute way to teach and in fact there is no absolute way to do anything. This very fact alone demonstrates the importance of teachers' ability to shape thier students into fine men and women through their methodology. Just as it is important to base educational strategies on the strengths of the students in the classroom, it is equally important to have that same impact outside of school through summer assignemnts and projects.                                                  ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
8F47C4F378EA,"I am a high school student and in my point of view what i infer about reading the passage is that election by popular votes needs to happen. why am I thinking like this? There are several reasons, well first i dont know what this people are doing maybe they are being paid to choose the president it dosen't mean enything that they got more ethoes than the rest of the state. People should choose who they really want to be the president, they should give prove of when they count the votes.

The countrie is the home of alot of people imigrants and native we all should have the same rigths and that rigth is to vote for the person that will lead the countrie to a better place, not some slate of the state. Maybe they got more ethoes than the rest of the countrie but each person is smart to know what is good and what is wrong. In the passage they tell the reader, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Then what is the point of voting maybe this people are not even considering the people who vote they are only doing what they think is rigth.

This people have alot of money but they still want more and more, inportant people would brive this elector with alot of money, and they would be doing whatever they are ask for. They could be 200 votes of the entire state that if the state only as 20 electors thoes are the votes that are counting in real life. What future could we have trusting this electors our chances are really low we cant let this happen .

After reading all my letter you will understeand why did I talke like this about the elector and why  the electoral college have to be remove. The word of the entire countrie should coun't more than the wor of 200 people. Thoes 200 could be in who knows what to trust our future. this is why I think that electoral college is not an opssion.                            ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
DE8EAEAC72D9,"Imagine of having your own business by the time you graduate from high school. I think its a good idea for students to commit or take specific courses at a young age for their future lifestyle because you will have more experiences also you can save a lot of money, you don't have to worry about for college. Althogh some people think its a bad idea for students to commit to a career because they just into high school, However they will have more experience by the time they graduate frome high school and live a better lifestyle because they already havea good career and have money and they might have graduate early and started their own family or family business. Some students like to be me a business man or women so the plan to take classes about thoses to topics so they can learn more and they can help the others with their busines.

The first reason why its a good idea to commit to career in a young age is because you will gain more experience and gather information that can help you with your career and have a better lifestyle so you can have everything you need and don't need nobody to help and you can ask others for their advices on hows to gain more experience and some students can take online class. I understand having to plan your career little early in hard because you have to have good grades and enough credits graduate early. So if you want to have better lifestyle you have to put in te hard work and you can't stop unitl you reached your goal and your happy with it. also you apply for jobs to gain as many experience you wanna gain for explam you can work at the fast food resturants and at subway and the doctor offices or at walmart and forever twentyone. and having a business is hard because my dad has one and we barly get to see him because he's so busy and his bussines is not even to close to us is at TN and we get to see him only once a month or two.

The second why having a career is so impartant because you can save alot of money like a lot. Because saving money is good because you can really rich and you have to be selfish in the begging if you want to became something great in life. although you have to spend a lot oof money at first because you having for your classes and programs that your in so you can study what you want and there are some school that will help their students to be succesful in life but have to put in the hard work first if you don't then thats a big problem because your not going to be rich your not going have a lot of money to have good lifestyle. So thats why students need to applying for jobs at age of sixteen and build baby steps to save money and doing good at school and having a better. There is alot of ways for stuents to gain money and save them for explam you make cupcakes at home and sale them at school or other events you can make alot of things a sale them and that how you save alot of money by working hard in school and having a job or making stuff.

The last reason for having your career planed out in a young is to help you in the future weather you have to go college or not and if you have enough credits and your testing scores are good and you don't have a history of getting into a lot of fights and trouble. Then college is for you and you don't have to worry about having to pay for college becuase you can get a schoarship to the best schools ever and college is a important part of your career and life its where you can get more education and help you to become a better at what your doing in the future and if you want to something big you have to work hard like you can't stop because people that put the work they don't stop until they got they want in life and honstley some people have to work hard for everything they want but others don't because the were born with golden life.

Although some its a good idea to have experience with other careers and with making stuff and having alot of money and not playing for college but first you have to put in the hard work in oreder to be commit to a career in a young age because its really hard when you wanna commit to something don't have the goods and good testing scores for in that means you have to do double the work that your already doing. some peple can do anything when they put their brain and mind to it and thats good because if i only foucus in school would have been a straight AB student but i didn't so its hard for me to do that now because there is no time left and what i am trying to say is that don't wait until the same minute to do something specially if you wanna have good career and want to commit to it.",0,original_moth,"Task:

57C5D1B5D26B,"What if out of the nowhere a person had to go out of their way to do something that wasn't needed? Wouldn't they be outraged and confused being forced into something that they know isn't necessary? So if this was implemented on a full scale of students wouldn't it fall apart completely. Knowing that the rule that would force students to do extracurricular activities could end up hurting the children and damaging the school, shouldn't it go away.

A school should support helping kids make their own decisions, but if they force them to make one it only hurts them and their growth. When someone constantly holds your hand and guides you to a choice it isn't possible to grow and learn. If they choose to hold their students hands throughout their schooling, how will they be able to grow and progress. If the children are forced into certain activities they won't be able to learn for themselves and become dependent on others. This can be shown in some schools were students pay others to write essay's for them but then fail their tests because nobody could help them. Also, it could ruin several students ability to manage their time if the principal forces them toward a activity. If a student who has a busy life gets more pressure on them they may give up on their grades. If they aren't able to manage their time on top of the activity, they won't be able to excel like how schools wants the students to. An example of this can be seen anywhere because if too much pressure is put on anyone they can get anxiety or depression from the stress. Lastly, it gives more stress on certain students because of the unfamiliar environment. If a child who is bad at interacting with others is forced to spend an upwards of 30 minutes or more a day alone with others it could make them anxious and scared. It would throw students into an unfamiliar place where they don't know anyone and don't even like the activity. This is shown in things like graduation or going to a new school, because teenagers may feel overwhelmed or stressed by the changes in environment. With all the damage the new rule would cause why let it stay in the education system.

It would change the school in many bad ways if this rule was allowed, which is why it can't be allowed to exist in our education. If the rule stays more money will have to go to clubs and activities then usually resulting in lower funds. A decrease in funds will happen since they need to buy more equipment for all clubs like volleyball. With more funds going to clubs it will be harder to improve the building itself and if any damage happens it may not be fixable. Which, is shown in modern capitalism where in order to expand you need to spend more money. Next, it will affect support given to the school. This will happen because if their kids are made to do something that affects them mentally in a bad way their parents will outrage. They would start losing students because the parents wouldn't support the school. This can be shown with things like the corona virus where people started to leave their countries after learning it was unsafe for their families. Last of all, it could affect the sponsors they get. This would happen because the school could start losing parents and kids which would affect how much money they get from sponsors and parents. Sponsors would leave because they no longer think that the school is worth their money since they are losing children and their parents. This can be shown in the stock market, where when funds are in a certain business and the value is going down the sponsors sell their stocks and leave. This would overall permanently damage the school if these events happened, which shows that this policy needs to be rid of.

It is only a waste to make that policy because it ends up hurting the kids and the school. There is no point in keeping this rule if it is just going to hurt everyone around it. So, if this school really cares about itself and its students it should let this activity law be abolished.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

(Like, I know I definitely forget stuff sometimes.)

But if we have an after school program, we can keep practicing and learning new things. And not just that, but we can also help each other out.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to urge you to support the preservation of this system for electing the President of the United States. While there are strong arguments on both sides, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic process and serves to protect the interests of all citizens and regions.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner highlights in his article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the outcome of the election is clearer and less likely to be disputed, reducing the risk of prolonged legal battles and political turmoil.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in electing the President. Judge Posner argues that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president, as they may neglect the interests and concerns of other regions. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the entire nation, not just certain pockets of support.

In addition, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states and pay attention to the concerns of these states. As Judge Posner explains, voters in swing states are more likely to be thoughtful and informed, as they carry the weight of deciding the election. By focusing campaign efforts on these states, candidates are more likely to address the concerns of the swing voters, resulting in a more engaged electorate and a president responsive to the needs of a broad range of Americans.

The Electoral College also serves to balance the influence of large and small states. While the popular vote would give disproportionate weight to heavily populated states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates pay attention to states with smaller populations. By restoring some weight to the political balance, the Electoral College ensures that candidates must take into account the concerns and interests of all states, regardless of size.

Finally, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, providing stability and avoiding the complications that would arise from run-off elections. This allows for a smooth and efficient election process, ensuring that the will of the people is upheld.

While critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, I believe that these practical advantages outweigh the concerns. The Electoral College upholds the principles of our federal system, ensures that candidates address the concerns of all regions, and promotes stability in presidential elections.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I hope that you will support the retention of the Electoral College as part of our democratic process. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this further or require any additional information.

Sincerely,

I am STUDENT_NAME, an eighth grader at SCHOOL_NAME. I disagree with your plan to require a 'B' average in classes to participate in sports. Many students are smart and apply themselves, but do not fully understand subject material.

Do not think that they are not trying to get a good grade; They just need more help understanding the material. I know many very smart students who have difficulty with a certain subject. they care about getting a good grade, and want to do well. Not many of the se people play sports, but this new policy you have proposed will still affect them. Many students have a 'C', and they just need to get better help for that. I believe that doing sports helps a student get better grades, as they have a drive to continue, so as not to get kicked off their team. They will also have time to exercise and stretch while playing sports, which increases cardiovascular activity. You yourself said that ""The best way to prepare is to get your blood pumping through cardiovascular activity"".

Blood flow increases cognitive activity, which will help students achieve better grades because they will understand the subject matter better. Sports allow students to take a break from school and have some time with their friends. They will want to stay with their freinds, so they have another motive to try harder and get good grades.

A3E6A572C6E5," Have you ever felt like you were being pushed to become something you didn't want to be? I have, and it was a difficult experience. My parents wanted me to be successful and happy, but they didn't understand the pressure and anxiety they were putting on me. I remember feeling like I was under so much stress and pressure because I wanted to pursue a career in dance, but my family didn't support me. They wanted me to be a doctor, and I felt like I was being forced to give up my dreams.

It's important to remember that everyone has the right to follow their own dreams and aspirations. It's not fair to force someone to become something they don't want to be just to make others happy. In fact, it can lead to feelings of resentment and unhappiness.

I learned this lesson early on in my life when I was trying to pursue a career in dance. My family didn't support me, and I felt like I was being pushed to give up on my dreams. But I refused to give up. I worked hard and persevered, and eventually, I became a successful dancer.

It's important to remember that it's okay to dream big and pursue your own aspirations. No one has the right to tell you what you can and can't do.

93BAA0D48EF3,"A four-day work week with ten hours at school each day is a topic that has been widely debated in recent years. While some people argue that it would be a great benefit to students, others believe that it would be detrimental. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of a four-day work week with ten hours at school each day.

One of the main advantages of a four-day work week is that it would provide students with more time to focus on their studies. With ten hours at school each day, students would have more time to complete their assignments, prepare for exams, and engage in extracurricular activities. This would allow them to better balance their academic and personal lives, which is crucial for their overall well-being. Additionally, a four-day work week would give students more time to spend with their families and friends, which is important for maintaining healthy relationships.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to a four-day work week. One of the main concerns is that it would require students to work longer hours each day in order to complete the same amount of work as they currently do in a five-day work week. This could lead to increased stress and burnout for students, as well as a decrease in the quality of their work. Additionally, a four-day work week could lead to a decrease in the number of extracurricular activities that students participate in, as they would have less time to devote to these activities.

In conclusion, a four-day work week with ten hours at school each day has both pros and cons. While it would provide students with more time to focus on their studies and maintain healthy relationships, it could also lead to increased stress and burnout, as well as a decrease in the number of extracurricular activities that students participate in. Ultimately, it is up to educators, parents, and students to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of a four-day work week and determine whether it would be a good fit for their particular situation.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,2

But,  I know some people might say that shorter school time wouldn't be good for us, like, it would make us less prepared for college or the workforce.  But, I don't think that's true.  Like, think about it, if we had more time after school, we could pursue our passions and interests, like, maybe start a business or learn a new skill.  And,  if we're not so tired and stressed from school, we could focus better in class and learn more. 

Now,  let's talk about celebrities like Eminem.  I know some people might say that they're not a good example, since they didn't finish high school or college.  But,  I think they're still a good example, because they showed that with hard work and dedication, you can achieve your dreams, even if you don't have a traditional education.

Attending school in person has its perks, but online learning has become a game-changer in recent years. While some people argue that in-person learning is the only way to go, I believe that online learning offers a unique set of benefits that make it just as valuable.

First and foremost, attending school in person allows you to build strong relationships with your peers and teachers. You can connect with them on a personal level, ask questions, and get help when you need it. You can also learn from their experiences and perspectives, which can broaden your horizons and help you grow as a person. In contrast, online learning can be more isolating, as you may not have as much opportunity to interact with your classmates or instructors.

However, online learning also offers some significant advantages. For one, you can access resources from anywhere, at any time. This means you can learn at your own pace, and you don't have to worry about missing out on important information just because you were absent from class. You can also save money on materials, as you don't have to buy textbooks or other supplies. Plus, online learning allows you to gain insights from multiple perspectives, as you can access resources from all over the world.

Another benefit of online learning is that it can be more flexible. You can take classes from the comfort of your own home, or even on the go. This can be especially helpful for people who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas where access to education is limited.

Of course, there are also some challenges to online learning. For one, it can be difficult to connect with your classmates and instructors. You may not have as much opportunity to ask questions or get help when you need it. Additionally, online learning can lack the hands-on activities that are so important for learning certain subjects, like science or math. And while online learning can offer a more personalized experience, it can also be more impersonal, as you may not have as much face-to-face interaction with your instructors.

As you are well aware, elections in the United States are of extreme importance. Therefore, it is vital to have the best system possible when electing officials. Maintaining the current system of Electoral College would be a fatal mistake to our country. We must elect canidates by poular vote alone.

According to the articele

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Pulumer, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Beccause of the winner-take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" Americans who are voting the the next president should have the right to hear what canidates have to say. They may be the only one in their state who is not a democrat, but shouln't their vote still be heard.

The article also states that, ""Perhaps most morrying is the prospect of a tie in the elctoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the Houise of Representatives, where sate delegations vote on the president."" Shouldn't the American people get to decide who their president is?! We fought a war so that we would be able to govern ourselves. If the House of Representatives are allowed to choose our president, then why did why fight the war againg Great Britain? It isn't right.

Though the article

In Defense of the Electoral Collge: Five Reasons to keep our despised methos of choosing the President sates that ""it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not be the winner of the popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely."" The opposition even admits that the President may not be who the nation wants as their leader. That should never happen.

As you see Senator, Electoral College must be abolished by any means neccessary. To keep such an unjust system goes against the very principle the America was founded on. ""We the people..."" It was not ""We the government..."" or ""We the rulers..."". How can we claim to be a nation of liberty when the citizend are unable to determine who their president should be.

It's important to keep in mind that many students preform various activities when discussing a summer assignment. Some schools offer up this assignments, that way students are able to learn during break. The question isn't whether summer assignments are necessary or not, because having prior knowledge going into a class is important, but rather the question is whether the summer assignments should be be comprised of questions made by teachers or questions made by students. Having questions created by students, will make the summer assignments much more useful.

If you ask any student who pays attention in a certain class about the way they feel about that class, they're sure to give you a wide array of emotions that they felt toward certain topics or units. For example, if you ask a student their thoughts on unit 7, they are able to tell you if it was hard or easy and if it was on the difficult side, they would be able to tell you what kind of questions confused them. having this foresight is very important when creating questions, you are able to give other students more exercises for the questions you think are more difficult.

Another reason why it is more beneficial for students to create summer assignments rather than teachers, is because teachers tend to over prepare students which could become damaging. ""Overprepare"" can mean that you know the bare minimum and more, which does apply to teachers summer assignments, however, knowing too much unnecessary information can make you forget important information. Overcrowding summer assignments with non vital knowledge can also be discouraging to students, and it will make them not want to attempt the work.

Overall, having student created questions will benefit other students taking that class, because, at the end of the day, students understand what it's like to be a student. A student is not just a person who attends a form a schooling but an actual person. Students need time for sports, jobs they may have, or even just socializing and hanging out with friends. Other people who understand these struggles, should be the ones who ultimatley be in control of the questions.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

First of all, the minimum wage is like, super low right now. Like, it's not enough for people to live on. If we raise it, people can afford to pay their bills and stuff without having to work like, a million hours. It's not fair that some people have to work so much just to survive.

Another thing is, raising the minimum wage can help people get out of poverty. There are lots of people who are living in poverty, and it's not because they're lazy or anything. It's just that they don't have the opportunity to make enough money. If we raise the minimum wage, it can help them get out of poverty and have a better life.

Also, it's not just good for people, it's also good for the economy. When people have more money, they can spend it on things they need and want. That means businesses will make more money too, and they can create more jobs. It's like, a win-win situation.

Now, some people might say that raising the minimum wage will make businesses lay off workers. But, that's not necessarily true. Businesses can just adjust their prices a little bit, and they'll still make a profit. Plus, if they're paying their workers more, they'll be happier and work harder, which is good for everyone.

Introduction

Makeup artistry is a growing field that has gained popularity in recent years. It is a creative and artistic profession that involves applying makeup to enhance and transform an individual's appearance. As an eighth-grade student, I believe that offering makeup artistry courses in our school would be a valuable addition to our curriculum. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of a partnership with local companies that would allow students to explore being a makeup artist, how taking these courses can improve personal social health, and provide examples of how these courses can help people to learn how to take care of their hair, do their makeup, and dress appropriately.

Partnership with Local Companies

Partnering with local companies would provide students with valuable opportunities to learn about the makeup industry and gain practical experience. Local companies would provide students with the opportunity to work with professional makeup artists and learn about the latest makeup trends and techniques. Additionally, local companies would provide students with the opportunity to network with other makeup artists and potentially gain employment in the industry.

Improving Personal Social Health

Taking makeup artistry courses can have a positive impact on personal social health. Makeup artistry is a form of self-expression and can boost self-esteem and confidence. By learning how to apply makeup, individuals can enhance their natural features and feel more comfortable in their own skin. Additionally, makeup artistry can be a form of stress relief and can help individuals relax and unwind.

Examples of How Courses Can Help

Taking makeup artistry courses can help individuals learn how to take care of their hair, do their makeup, and dress appropriately. For example, students can learn how to style their hair using various techniques and tools. They can also learn how to apply makeup to enhance their natural features and create a variety of looks. Additionally, students can learn about different types of clothing and how to dress appropriately for different occasions.

Building Skills and Confidence

Taking makeup artistry courses can help individuals build skills and confidence. By learning how to apply makeup, individuals can enhance their natural features and create a variety of looks.

EBDA2869DB6D,"Imagine if you only had one person/option to ask for help. That would be kind of difficult to learn new stuff and opinions. Asking multiple people for help is better than one person because you can learn more from different people. Three reasons that state my point are, people can get more ideas, they can hear different opinions, and they can learn more.

Asking multiple people for help can get you more ideas. These following are explained examples of why you can get more ideas from just asking more than one person. You can learn what other people say. When people learn what other people think they get more ideas. Another example is they can get more details on what their asking for. When people only get one answer it has to be correct, but when they get more than one they have options to choose from. Also, if people ask more people for answers they will have a more detailed response. To be fair, its hard to ask multiple people because its hard to find people that always give the right answer, but thats why we ask different people. All of these are explained reasons of why its better to ask multiple people rather than one.

People have different opinions. These are examples of why asking multiple people for help is better than asking one person for help. Not everyone has the same opinions. every one has different reasons or examples so people could get more details. Another example is that there could be better opinions than others. If there are multiple answers there is more to choose from. Also there are more resources. Using resources people can choose which answer they think is most likely correct. These examples are why having more options for help can help someone make a better choice.

Someone can learn more from asking more people. Asking more than one person to help can help things be more understandable. It helps people understand that there is can be more than one answer. Another example is that you can learn more about the question your asking. There could be a question someone is asking about, and that person changes their opinion a lot. Asking more people for help helps you learn more. If there are more choices to ask for help the more people learn.

AFB0A60B6038,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My out look on the dilemma is that all students should not be required to participate in community service. I say this because some students who have extra curricular activities, would not have time for such tasks. Also, unless the service was done during school hours, other students parents ,who work late, would not have any means of transportation. There for students should have a choice on whether or not to partake in community service, for conflicts in their lives would make participating in such activity a stressful scenario. So i disagree on that part.

My other opinion on this subject would be for students with low grades or disruptive behavior in class, should be required to endure the community service. It would be a helpful alternative to ISS. They would learn not to be unseemly and to act appropriately during school in addition to a new view of appreciation for their community. This change in discipline would result in less students acting up, leaving our school with a bright out look on our future. So there for i also agree with your proposition.

So for now i am neutral to the subject at hand, i can not say i agree or disagree due to the variety of students in this fine establishment. So the choice is up to you on whether or not you decide to force stress on our students or bring them a bright hopeful future.

I hope your decision is a wise one.

One would typically use this saying if an action they make improves the situation for one person, but creates a worse situation for another. However, if Professor Thomas Huang's new 'Facial Action Coding System' proves to be what he says it can be, then Huang believes that there actually is a way to make everyone happy, even in the school setting. The implementation of technology able to read the emotional expressions of children in the classroom is valuable for both the teachers and the students.

Inside a school classroom, there is no doubt that it is hard to please everyone. Therefor, when a student becomes disengaged from the lesson, they often become bored and fall behind in the class. After-all, all students learn differently, so it is inevitable that some of the students will become disengaged. However, with his new technology, Professor Huang predicts that the ""classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson"" (Paragraph 6). With this technology implemented, anytime a student starts to fall behind during the lesson, the computer could make slight adjustments to the teacher's plans to help redirect the student back on track. It is common knowledge that the more a student falls behind in a class, the harder it becomes to catch up, which in turn makes the student fall behind even more. It is a viscious cycle that all stems from a day of not paying attention that could be averted by this technology.

This technology could also help both students and teachers in a long-term manner. In paragraph 7 of the article, it is revealed that this new technology could ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"" (Paragraph 7). Say there is a classroom without an emotion-sensing computer. In the classroom there is a student who, behind the fake smile is dealing with something that they cannot tackle on their own. The teacher never notices, and the child goes on without help. Now imagine if there was a computer in that class. Once it sensed the troubling expressions on the child's face, it could flag down the teacher and alert him or her to the students problem, resulting in the child getting the counceling he or she needs. In an extreme case, this classroom technology could end up saving a life.

The amount of improvement a classroom could see if this technology was implemented correctly would be immeasurable. The system could prevent students from falling behind in class because they cannot relate to how the teacher is teaching, and the technology could see through fake expressions hiding more troubled thoughts. With this sort of system, it may actually be possible to ""make everyone happy.""                         ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

57D5D51D6D7A,"You can always ask for advice from a friend, but have you tried to seek or talk to multiple people? It's a better option. Usually when people ask for advice, they talk to more than one person. This is much better than just hearing one person's opinion. Even though sometimes someone would just like to talk to their friend for advice, maybe it could be better for that person. Seeking multiple options when asking for advice can help someone make a better choice because they might like another piece of advice better than the other and they could be more open to try more than one piece of advice at one time.

Someone might like a piece of advice better than the other. Someone might like a piece of advice better than the other because one might make them feel at ease or just be easier for them to understand while the other does not make sense or work out. For example, if someone is looking for advice on how to serve the ball better over the net in volleyball, they are not going to want to take the advice that tell them to just get stronger, they are going to take the one that helps them maybe on technique. Maybe the opposite, it depends what they are looking for. So someone liking a piece of advice better than the other is a reason that a person might talk to more than one person for advice because they might like one outlook better than the other.

Someone could want to try more than one piece of advice at one time. Trying more than one piece of advice at one time could be effective because all pieces of advice that you are taking could all be similar in some way. Using the same volleyball example, someone might say ""you need a faster arm swing"" and the other ""you need to toss the ball higher"". These are both giving that person advice on technique. If you use both, you will be happier with the results. Using more than one piece of advice is effective because both could work in the same situation.

To help someone make a better choice when asking for advice they should seek for multiple options. This is because they might like one piece of advice better than the other. One may be good for the situation, and the other may not be good. Another reason is because they might want to do or try more than one piece of advice at a time, like if all of the pieces of advice tie together, the result could be good or better. In conclusion, seek for more than one option when asking for advice because you should see all of the opportunities and ways that they could help.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

Even though downsides are apparent, is there enough positive aspects to extracurricular activities that they should be required?

At Generic_School, there is a wide variety of activities and clubs offered for students from grades seven through twelve. Many students are able to find a club that they enjoy, and make attending that activity a part of their weekly routine. However, there are some students who just can't find the right club for them, or don't have the motivation. Sometimes they are busy with other activities outside of school such as sports or practicing a hobby, and they can't find any room in their schedule for more activities. Requiring everybody to participate in extracurricular activities would give some students the motivation they need to find a club that they really enjoy, but it could also force others to give up an aspect of their routine at home so they could have time to participate in activities at school. This would be especially devastating to a student who is training hard to become an athlete, or practicing a hobby they really enjoy, because they would have to give that up to choose from a variety of activities that they may have no interest in participating in.

Extracurricular activities can be very productive and enjoyable for any student, but only in the right setting. When a student decides that they want to commit to a club, they are more likely to work hard and enjoy themselves while participating. A student whose parent or principal tells them they must participate won't enjoy themselves, and will probably make the experience worse for everyone else around them. While an unmotivated student is wasting time in a club, they could be exploring an interest at home, or developing a skill set that one day could turn into their career. A student might select yearbook, but have no interest in journalism. A student could choose to participate in the student government, but not have any ideas for the school. While they aren't being productive, there could be another student who was denied a spot in their favorite program, all because someone who wasn't interested in the topic was required to sign up. Requiring extracurricular activities could take time away from productive activities elsewhere, and deny passionate students a chance at their dreams.

Students should all have a chance to be an active member of their school community, and have the freedom to choose what they participate in. Not everyone is aware the benefits of participating in extracurricular programs, and schools should make the student body aware of them, but they should not be required. Schools could encourage participation by offering a variety of activities, getting feedback from students on what needs to change, and advertising that extracurricular activities can be a fun way to meet new people, and learn more about a subject you're interested in. Providing students with a way to expand their knowledge and practice something they find interesting is a great way to inspire them to work hard. As soon as it becomes a requirement, students will begin to loose interest. Schools need to strongly encourage extracurricular activities, but not require them.               ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
B6B85CE5C8F5,"Improvisation versus following a script: which is the better way to become someone?

As an 8th-grade student, I have been actively seeking ways to improve myself and become the best version of myself. In my research, I have come across different methods of self-improvement, such as improvisation and following a script. In this essay, I will compare and contrast these two methods and argue that improvisation is the better way to become someone.

Improvisation is the act of creating something on the spot, without a plan or script. It is a way of adapting to the situation and making the most of it. For example, when I was part of a school play, I had to improvise my lines when my fellow actor forgot their lines. At first, I was nervous and unsure of what to say, but with some practice, I was able to come up with something that fit the situation and made the scene more interesting.

Following a script, on the other hand, is a more structured approach to becoming someone. It involves following a set of instructions or rules to achieve a specific goal. For example, when I was learning how to ride a bike, I followed a set of instructions that told me how to balance, pedal, and steer. While following a script can be helpful in achieving a specific goal, it can also be limiting and inflexible.

In my personal experience, I have found that improvisation is the better way to become someone. When I was part of a school debate team, I had to improvise my arguments on the spot. At first, I was nervous and unsure of what to say, but with practice, I was able to come up with arguments that were relevant and persuasive. This experience taught me the importance of being adaptable and able to think on my feet.

Furthermore, improvisation allows for more creativity and individuality. When I was part of a school improv group, I was able to express myself in ways that I never thought possible. I was able to come up with unique and original ideas, which helped me to stand out and be myself. This experience taught me the importance of embracing my own unique qualities and expressing myself in my own way.

In conclusion, improvisation versus following a script are two different methods of self-impro",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,6

Getting opinions from others can not only lead to making the best choice but also it can relieve stress and and make the individual feel accomplished as well.

Getting opinions from others can help you make better decisions in the future because if you have a good experience you can always ask for opinions. For example if you are making a tough decision and you ask for opinions and they are really helpful you would probably ask for opinions again in the future right?

Getting opinions from your piers will not only help you in the future it can relieve stress as well as help the individual feel accomplished of themselves. For example if you make a tough decision backed up by you piers wouldst you feel relieved of stress and abolished?

8A895792F3C7,"Dear, State Senator

The voting of the president every four years is one of the most important events of American history. However I feel that it has become unfair and a volatile way of voting.

I believe that we the people should rid ourselves of the electoral college and turn to the popular vote instead. Too many events concerning the need for this change have been caused by the electoral college. Even Nixon who was caught up in a electoral vs. popular vote dispute said ""aboilish the electoral college."".

First and foremost the fact that the peolpe do not vote for the president is a worying factor when the presidential election comes around. The people vote on an electoral slate of electors who may or may not actually vote for the president you want perhaps deciding to ""defy the will of the people""from source 2 and vote against their political party. also you dont have the power to decide which candidates will be running so the people who will vote for your president are possibly unrelateable politicians who may be waiting to turn against the political party they belong to. there is the very likely posibility based on the information in source 2 staing that ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states diddnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets diddnt get to see a single coampaign add."". personally I dont know how anybody would be able to make the correct descision when electing a elector based on what you may hear about them from a friend a couple states over who may or may not have seen the candidates. Although highly unlikely, a tie in the electoral college would mean the unbalancing of power between states.

overall the electoral college is unfair and needs to be replaced by the will of the people and not the will of a masked politician.             ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
1C7D1F04503D,"Students who struggle in school find it to be exhausting or even stressful, but participating in extracurricular activities may change their mind. Educating students may set them up for success in the future but can also put them at a worrisome situation to finish work on time and get projects done. Students who ask questions and seek for help may be overwhelmed and have trouble understanding the concept, in this situation students need to take their mind off this and do something to relieve them of their troubles. Extracurricular activities can impact students by relieving their stress, improving a more positive mindset, and finally having a chance to make new friends.

School educates students about subjects that may be useful to have later in their lives, while this can be helpful it can also be stressful. Being in an extracurricular activity such as soccer club may gives students an opportunity to have fun and play with their friends, by doing this it can be enjoyable and take away stress from school. Although school is overwhelming sometimes, extracurricular activities make students embrace an opportunity that takes away all stress and helps them focus on exciting activities. By relieving stress the students will feel that they can achieve all the work given to them, this will boost their confidence knowing they can do anything.

Sometimes students might give up on their confidence because of all the work they have to get done. An extracurricular activity such as working on the yearbook can help students focus on an activity that helps them believe they are capable of achieving anything. Building confidence, having a better self esteem, and believing in yourself, are all important steps to having a more positive mindset, this impacts students because it helps students get their work done and doesn't have them worry about stressing out. A positive and confident mindset is one of the most important steps to achieve future goals, by being more confident anything can be accomplished.

The final reason why participating in an extracurricular activity is there will be plenty of people to work with and a chance to make some new friends. Beside all the fun and activities to do in different clubs there will also be people to work with and a chance to make some new friends. By making new friends it will improve one's mindset socially and is another way to deal with stress because when having new friends it can make someone feel happy and excited. Dealing with stress isn't an easy task, but a way to being happier is to make new friends.

School can be stressful sometimes, but with extracurricular activities the amount of stress should be decreased. Extracurricular activities such as sports clubs, working on the year book, or even serving on student council are all opportunities for students to direct their focus on having fun instead of being overwhelmed by all the work. Being positive, relieving stress, and making new friends are all effective ways to not be overwhelmed in school, instead students should embrace going to school because of all the opportunities given.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
falcon_180b_v1_615,"Passage 1:

In the year 2000, the world’s car population reached 520 million. It is expected to grow to 1.3 billion by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. The growth of the car population is a problem because cars contribute to global warming and climate change. Cars produce carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, causing the Earth’s temperature to rise. This is known as the greenhouse effect.

Passage 2:

The number of cars on the road is increasing at an alarming rate. Cars are a major source of air pollution. The exhaust from cars contains nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and other harmful gases. These gases can cause health problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. They also contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming.

Passage 3:

Cars are a major source of noise pollution. The noise from cars can be harmful to human health. It can cause hearing loss, high blood pressure, and stress. It can also disturb sleep and interfere with communication. Noise pollution from cars can also harm wildlife. It can disrupt their communication, mating, and feeding patterns.

Based on these passages, it is evident that limiting car usage can have significant advantages. Firstly, it can help reduce carbon emissions and slow down the process of global warming. This is because cars are a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, which will help to mitigate the effects of climate change.

Secondly, limiting car usage can help to reduce air pollution. As mentioned in the passages, cars are a major source of air pollution. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce the amount of harmful gases released into the atmosphere, which will improve air quality and reduce the risk of health problems.

Lastly, limiting car usage can help to reduce noise pollution. Cars are a major source of noise pollution, which can have harmful effects on human health and wildlife. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce the amount of noise pollution and create a more peaceful environment.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages. It can help to reduce carbon emissions and slow down global warming, improve air quality, and reduce noise pollution.

243C2673D4A1,"In our third world era, people have lots of personal problems. Most of the time, they get too difficult for us to solve them by ourselves, so we search for advice from others. It's intelligent to ask for advice, however, people should never settle for less and only ask one person. People should always talk to more than one person, for contradicting point of views, more solutions, and more reliable people.

Listening to more than one person for advice will give the opportunity to hear different opinions. It's a good thing to be open mined, and listen to there point of view because people will most likely see there problem in a different way. They might even see there issue as not as big of a problem anymore, or that there issue is easy to solve, now that they're looking at it in a different way. Which will help them in the future when they have bigger problems. Going to a person for solutions to a problem, and then getting the same advice they told themselves, isn't going to help them at all. Seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice. People need those contradicting mindsets in order for us to see the problem clearer.

Asking for advice gives people ideas, and then they act on them. Though sometimes the idea doesn't work out.

That is why people need to ask multiple people for advice. There will be a higher chance that they will find the solution they need. Even if someone asked more than one person for advice and still they didn't get what they need, they could take the ideas they got and piece them together. Asking for more advice would never hurt anyone, but instead help people locate more ideas and more solutions.

As people ask for advice, they tend to speak to people who don't know how to give good advice, that is something they should avoid. Talking to multiple people will give others more information and good advice. People should also talk to professionals for better advice. They should try to talk to more than one because others may give better information for them or have a different mindset. It makes a significant improvement for finding better advice.

Searching for more advice is always beneficial, and it helps people understand there issue better. It's very unlikely for someone to get the advice they need on there first try, and most people dwell on the only advice they get, so it is important to always ask more people. First, people will find more solutions and come up with more ideas. They will also understand the issue clearer when listening too more opinions. Finally, if you speak to more people, you will find people with more experience and factual opinions. Searching for more advice will always help you, so don't miss out on the opportunity of finding better advice.                     ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

First the childs scedule. Some children are busyer than other so there could be a posibility that that he or she well not have enough time for that activiy. Next the activity could be to early for the child and they might have to wake up earlier than anticipated and not feeling as energized for the day ahead. Then the activity could start or end late which would cause the child to lose precious hours of sleep.

Second it could cause the children to start academicaly failing due to say not haveing enough time to study for a quiz or haveing enough time to do homework. This could also have a major impact on the students gardes causeing the to drop dramaticly. Time that cuts into school also cuts into time to study. Studying time is very crushial because it helps the child to remember the material for there quizes and tests. Finally it could take up sleep time which could posibly make that child tired and sluggish in school witch would cause the student not to do as well in shcool as if he or she were well rested and had an desent amount of sleep that night.

Third is that some kids dont do extracurricular activites is that it causes stress.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes by way of online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they will get distract, have questions that can not be solve, and learn nothing without internet.

Student will get distract from learning at home. Some student have self control to learn, but most don't. They may doing another thing while learning, or fall in to a sleep. Student can play video game and the teacher will not notice. For example, kids are the fast learner on computers. My brother who is in second grade, he's English class is taking online. During the lesson, he open up another window to play game. He divide the screen into two small screen, so one side is English class and the another one is the game that he like to play, and teacher do not notice that. Technology is a simple way to get education, but also is the way how students can ""cheat"".

Student may have question during the online class that can't get solve. Not anything online can give you an answer. My geometry teacher was absent on one day, and she made a video of the lesson we missed. During the video, I have a lot question, I tried to find them online, but I find nothing. I couldn't solve the question until I see her again. There is a lot simpler to learn in class because teacher will give you example to help you understand the question and give some practice of it, this way you can really learn and understand the lesson. Online class is just give you a lesson, when you have a question, you have no one to ask and no where to get help.

Online class will not work without internet. Some places have problem on internet, if that happen, student will not learn anything.

5fff10f6,"Dear State Senator, My name is PROPER_NAME and i am an American Citizen. I already know about The Electoral College and its process. I know it has 538 electors and 270 of the electoral votes are needed to elect president. Along with that, I know that our founding fathers developed it in the constitution and their chosen by the candidate's political party. But i do not know why so much people bash The Electoral College when its a good thing. Based on my research, The Electoral College should stay and should be used overtime in an election for President.

To Start off, most people think of The Electoral College as a nondemocratic method of selecting a president based on Source 3: by Richard A. Posner. Its is a nondemocratic method because its the electors who elect the president not the people. Based on Richard however, ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed"". Its possible to win the electoral vote but not the national popular vote. It happened in 2000, with Gore when he was running. But that was the first time since 1888.

There are some flaws of The Electoral College however. According to Source 2: written by Bradford Plumer, voters vote for electors who elect the President not the people. No one really knows the electors and they cant be seen holding public office. It depends on the state to pick the electors and voters cannot always control whom their electors vote for. In addition, as Bradford said ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidates"". These disadvantages may want to make people disapprove of The Electoral College disregarding its advantages.

There are five really good reasons for keeping the Electoral College. Based on Source 3 the first is ""certainty of outcome"". This basically means if the winning candidate's share of the Electoral votes is high most likely his popular votes will be too. The next reason is that its everyone's president. Like rodney he only focused on benefiting the one region and the Electoral College had no favor in that and as a result he got no gains from them. The third reason is ""swing state"" like Richard calls it. The ""toss up states"" are the ones who really decide the election. Voters in those states pay more attention to the campaign since they are the ones who will decide the outcome. The last two reasons are the big states and avoiding runoff elections. A large state gets more attention from Presidential candidates in a campaign then a small state does. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candiates receives a majority of the votes cast.

These five reasons make the electoral College what it is now. Most voters dont watch the Presidential campaign's and chose whoever. The Electoral College is fulled with educated people who actually take the time and watch and study the campaign's so their vote is the vote that makes a difference. Despite the Electoral College's lack of democratic pedigree its still should stay.",0,train_essays,,1
A2F58A334981,"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) has 44 major muscles in the human face programmed and their movements detectable by its software. While some may not understandable the use of this technology, it would be groundbreaking and highly effective within our classrooms. Many humans portray false or pretend emotions to other humans for various, different reasonings. However, the FACS could be used to break through this method of manipulation and deception by tracking the facial muscles being used and moved by its subject. It would allow the computer to calculate the different emotions and feelings being present in its subject, which could be used in a matter of many different ways.

Within the classroom, various emotions can be felt by its students while learning new topics and receiving their education. Feelings can range from excitement and an interest in learning new subjects to being bored or unmotivated to proceed with the lesson. Day by day, technology is further and used more frequently within our schools, allowing us to adapt new education methods. Most students in the US are presented with an electronic device by their school to complete their homework and classwork on. The FACS could easily be intregrated into these devices, affecting how education could be taught and learned. If it was being used in a correct, effective manner, it could change how we teach our students forever!

Let's imagine that a student was perhaps puzzled and confused by a lesson being taught using technology. The FACS program could detect this, modifying the information to be more understandable and/or enjoyable to the student. This would allow for education to be more effective in many different ways. It could be very different for how two tenth graders in the same class learn new subjects and topics the most effectively. If this was released into schools, it is very possible and most likely that grades would improve drastically. This technology could also assist those with special needs or learning disabilities to teach them in the most effective, best technique for them.

While being present at school, not all emotions displayed by students are caused by learning. There might be unknown stresses or difficulties at home or personal lives, causing emotional and/or physical distress. This can majorly affect their grades and learning experience, but also their overall health in general. Using the FACS to detect certain emotions and patterns in students could help notify educators and administration of possible issues with various causes. This would allow the student to gain access to the aid and assist they need to be able to persevere and stride forward with success. The health of students need to come first before learning and using technology to discover if they need assistance would invaluable to the school systems.

Technology is always advancing and evolving into different, new forms. The FACS is just one of the many things that could change our education system and how we teach students. Overall, it would provide aid to students that need it to succeed in their education and have more of a understanding in subjects they were originally confused by. A major benefit to using this program would be detecting distress in students, allowing the school to assist them and receive the help they need to succeed.

If we limit car usage there will be no smog. Our air would be so much cleaner. we couldnt get sick as much as we do be cause of the smog. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. they are also up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Car traffic was down to 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intesifying smog. Diesel fuel was blamed for all of the smog. the real reason is the fact that we have so many cars/trucks on the road at all times. Some of the trucks leak fuel.

Some states dont even get to see the candidates because they dont spend any time in states they know they dont have a chance of winning in. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all because of the winner- take- all system.

The electoral college does restore some of the weight in the political balance in large states. Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over sixty percent would perfer a direct vote than have the elctoral college vote also. The vote could be very close even if one candidate wins by much in the popular vote due to the presidency vote.

F54BD89B665A,"Advancements in how we are providing education continue to grow in the number of options for how one is receiving their education, Attending classes in school is a way that a majority of people receive their education, although some students are provided the opportunity and option to receive education outside of the typical school environment, this being options to learn from home. These options can include online courses, or a video conference. Students would not benefit from an education outside of the school environment as much as they would attending school, because being separated from a learning environment makes it more difficult to complete work and focus, participating in an online course allows for a lack of communication and ideas from other peers, receiving help from a teacher or an instructor would be more limited and restricted if one were to take an online course.

When working in an environment other than school, in this case at home, there is a removed focus of the student due to the setting they are in, and it may make learning more difficult in terms of concentration. Take for example, completing an online course. When students are at home taking the online course, they are placed in a more comfortable environment that lacks a working ambiance. Consequently, there is a greater chance that the student could focus their attention away from the work because of distractions that may include: television, chores, video games, and others. They may also more easily have the tendency to slack off and fall behind. While completing work at a school, students are surrounded by materials that place them in the mindset of their education, and provided help and support that encourages learning and success, rather than the at home comforts. Fortunately, at school there are a limited number of things that will focus ones attention away from what is needed to be completed, and done to the fullest potential with effort. In a working environment the encouragement to learn not only comes from the instructors, but also the other students that also attend the school.

Provided a student takes a course outside of a school, they are not always given the opportunity to have other peers around that are earning the same education. Some may claim that independent work is a better option, but what is so beneficial from attending a school is that students are exposed to other ideas developed by other students, and can participate in engaging discussions to make further achievements. Through these shared concepts, students can learn and comprehend more information off of one another, and make connections through certain ideas that are shared in class. This is demonstrated not only through group assignments, but through the participation of students during a class lesson. When a student is called on to share aloud, they are sharing an idea that may benefit someone else's learning experience, and help with their improvement and understanding of the curriculum in the class. School group projects allow students to share their ideas towards one another and further their comprehension of the relevant information. The students may develop a new way to perceive the topic, which, beneficially, is crucial for their success in the course and in the future. Ideas are not only defined through other students, but are defined through the professionalism the teachers carry in the course.

Students knowledge is generated through in person help from instructors, given that students struggle to make a connection and perceive the topic. Online courses do not give the opportunity for students to ask engaging and purposeful questions to help them make achievements. If students who are participating in taking an online course at home begin to struggle in a course, the lack of communication from someone who is experienced may further complicate that situation; however teachers i school direct students primarily to succeed in the course, and are willing to provide all the help necessary for a student's success. Even if students are taking a course through, for example a video conference, they still are not gaining the same help. If a video conference lesson was for a math course, it would be complicated for a teacher to view the mistakes made on practice that a student completed, and directly present to them what they did incorrectly. Teachers roles are to expand and elaborate on topics, so a student is able to gain a full understanding of the curriculum necessary for a test, or a future assessment. Those who are taking a course at home do not gain that full elaboration or background knowledge as a student who is receiving in person instruction would.

It is crucial for a person who wants a full and purposeful learning experience to attend an actual school. Although some may make claim that taking a course at home provides for more personal time to complete other necessary tasks, and can learn the same information as those who are attending an actual school, those that are not educated in a school aren't receiving the same fulfillment and educational opportunities as those who are educated in a school environment. Some may also believe that at home courses aren't as complex and are more flexible, but they allow for more mistakes, and less knowledge gained through them. Schools are not only beneficial but are crucial success not only in the courses they are taking, but in future roles, whether that be, for example, in a career, or becoming financially stable. Secondary options to attending a school, like courses at home, are not the same and do not hold the same roles or positions as a school do in the sense of a person's success. ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
llama_70b_v1578,"I think that social media have a big impact on society norms and values. Social media like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have changed the way we communicate and interact with each other. They also have a big influence on how we see the world and what we think is important.

First of all, social media have changed the way we communicate. We use social media to talk to our friends, family and even strangers. We share our thoughts, feelings and experiences with them. But sometimes, we don't even know who we are talking to. This can be dangerous because we don't know if the person on the other side is who they say they are. This can lead to cyberbullying, harassment and even online predators.

Secondly, social media have changed the way we see ourselves. We compare ourselves to others on social media and this can make us feel bad about ourselves. We see all these perfect pictures of people and we think that we are not good enough. This can lead to low self-esteem and even depression.

Furthermore, social media have also changed the way we see the world. We see all these news and information on social media and we think that it's true. But sometimes, it's not. Fake news and propaganda are big problems on social media. They can make us believe things that are not true and this can be dangerous.

Lastly, social media have a big influence on what we think is important. We see all these posts about celebrities and their lives and we think that it's important. We forget about the real issues in the world like poverty, hunger and climate change. We need to focus on what's really important and not get distracted by all the noise on social media.

In conclusion, social media have a big impact on society norms and values. It have changed the way we communicate, see ourselves, see the world and what we think is important. We need to be careful with social media and use it in a way that is healthy and positive. We need to be aware of the dangers and use it in a way that is good for us and for society.

ECC6BDC4B664,"Dear Senator; the electoral voting system should be abolished it is unfair and un-democratic electoral votes are not the votes f the people and thats all that should matter but there are countercaims that I will address. when aperson votes they do not actually vote for their candidate they vote for a group of electors for that candidate electors who may not even vote for the candidate they are sworn to. the electoral voting system is extremly unstable there are an even number of electoral voters in the united states making a tied vote a possibility which is very bad. Even though electoral votes are suposedly based on which candidates people vote for it does not at all mean that the candidate who most of the people voted for wil also be voted for by the electoral college.

The electoral voters are seperated by state and each state has its own number of electoral voters proportional to their population. because of this candidates change their campaigns to only focus on stateswith more electoral voters while this makes sense from a competitive perspective it makes it extremley unfair to states with smaller populations. This is wrong in many ways but the worst of all is that the electoral voting system encourages this kind of copetition

The electoral voting system is un-democratic the united states prides itself on being for the people and freedom but the electoral college represents the exact opposite of that. the electoral college votes not the people. the people are not voting and that is the exact opposite of what the united states supossedly stands for. Anyone who learns about the united states and sees the electoral colege will think that the united states. is not all its cracked up to be and that is not what the united states wants is it?

in conlcusion the senator you should definetly try to work toward abolishing the electoral college as it is un-democratic because it does not allow the people to have a direct say in who they are voting for. it is a very volatile voting system that could cause crashes and severities in the united states by aving tied votes and such. the electoral voting system uncourages some states to be left out by unfair competition because of the unstable way the number of electoral voters are balanced between states. And the electoral college essentially goes against everything the united states stands for and is supposed to believe in.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
D8CF376FEE74,"As we get older we want to travel to more places and get there faster, what if their was a quicker way without using cars. Certain places have been introducing a new concept, they calll themselves suburban pioneers. They live in places that have little or no cars, besides for the occassional bus, and all the stores that they would normally drive to are much closer now. Their are many benificial points to this new way of life such as a dramatic drop in greenhouse gasses, a stress free way to live, and also who doesn't desire to save a buck or two. If people start to limit the usuage of cars this planet might actually become a safer more joyful place to live.

In the past years greenhouse gasses have skyrocketed. The ozone layer is now trapping car exhaust fumes in earth and leading to what some might call global warming. Summer becomes hotter and longer, vice versa with winter. The U.S alone is  to blame for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emission. In europe it's 12 percent which is still quite a grave deal. Causes of not cutting back on the use of cars leads to tragic events such as the one that unfolded in Paris. Thier was so much smog in the air from motorized cars that for five days no one could start their cars unless they had a wish of paying a pricey fine. If people start to diminish the use of cars we can restore this humble planet to its former glory.

Forking out money for a car and having the luxory of fixing it up everytime a piece falls off or something malfunctions can become expensive quite rapidly. Who doesn't crave to save money anyways? Those who have chosen the suburban pioneer way of living have saved enormous enough of money. They don't have to pay for the insurance of the car and they don't have to pay to fix up the ole' rust bucket. Though some would rather have a car, but those who drive do the honors of car pulling which might not be the most time saving mechanism but in the long run it truely is beneficial. Also the government gains from all this. The government pays to build highways and roads for your car, but if cars aren't so common as time goes by roads get shorter and people start to get paid more because of all the money that the government is saving. Though money can't make us happy is still is an important piece to own in life.

In retrospect cars cause a lot of stress related problems. Everyone has one of those days where they wake up late and then suddenly remember that they have to get across town in a few minutes. Yes a car could get you there in less than no time, but wouldn't it be much simpler if you could just walk a closer distance. With the desecration of cars, stores and outlets would be much closer to your home. The stress of forgetting something at home and then having to drive 30 minutes to go get it would be diminished. Families could have more interaction with each other which means a closer bond could be formed. Receting the number of cars wouldn't be such an inhuman thing to do if you knew that the outcome was far more appealing.

To sum up, limiting the number of cars that roamed this earth would be more of a gain than a loss. Cars create hazardous gasses that are released into the air that are slowly but surely rendering us useless. Cars also cause safety hazards that can lead to a stressful environment. Plus if you don't use a car as often or get rid of it all together you can retain money for more important matters such as bills for your house or maybe a well deserved vacation. The posibilities are endless if we begin to limit the use of cars.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

Therefore I agree that students should engage in extracurricular activities because it teaches then responsibility, time management, and it is fun and benifitail to do.

First off doing something other than just school can teach kids responsibility and time management.

Doing a sport for example. To do this you would be completing school work and the sports work,so you would have to be able to complete school work on time then focus on the sport you're playing. The way to do all of that is to manage your time with school and activities to do all of your school work and keep your grades up. Doing a extra activity requires responsabilliy and dedicating time.

Secondly extracurricular can be fun and healthy for kids. You never know what doors will open for you by taking a chance. By playing a sport could take you in to a profetinal league. By joining school council could take you in to politics. You just never know what opportunities will come your way by doing something new. finding opportunities can be fun and uplifting. over all doing a extracurricular make you a more well rounded person.

Dear Principal,

It has come to my attention that some students have been performing community service, but others think it takes too much time away from what they need and want to do. Also, you are trying to decide whether to require students to perform community service for a grade. So, I am writing you this letter to express my position on whether students should be required to do community service or not. I strongly support students to be required to do community service because it will teach them responsibility, help them learn what it is like to work for a living, and the students who participate will become more mature.

First, I strongly support students to be required to do community service because it will teach them responsibility. In a nation wide poll, 60% of parents think their child is not responsible with their time and money. With community service requirements, this rate could go down with more students completing community service. I think this would make many parents very happy, because they have more responsible children.

Secondly, community service would help teens learn what it is like to work for a living. In many cases, students don't know what it is like to work because their parents are always buying everything they need to survive and grow up. They might take advantage of their parents because of getting everything they want. So, community service would help them understand their parents perspective a little bit more.

Last but not least, the students who participate in the community service will become more mature. When they show up to volunteer, they would see how seriously most jobs are taken, and learn that it will be them working hard when they get out of college, or even during college. So, they should mature a lot during community service.

In conclusion, I strongly support students to be required to do community service because the students who participate in the community will become more mature, the work would help teens learn what it is like to work for a living, and it will teach them responsibility. So by now, I hope you have made up your mind on whether students should be required to complete community service or not. Just think of the number of students coming to your office in trouble will decrease. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my letter.

And maybe he could do it but sleeping on a boat? Won't that be uncofortable. I've never slept on a boat but going through all the waves, the boat moving side to side, the sound of waves hitting the boat. You wouldn't get some good sleep.

Some people get sick on the boats. And you have to go through that every single day. The article said it took about two weeks to get across the pacific ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to China. That's like sitting in vomet for a month.

What would you have to eat every day. You can't keep food on a boat for a month. The boat would only be filled with food. Unless your going to have the same thing every day. That would be boring. I wouldn't do that!

There had to be a rainy day or even a storm at one point in that month. What would you do all day? You have no internet, you can't really play unless your playing cards. If its raining then it's going to be very slippery. So you would have to stay in place for a while. And when the rain stops, you still need to be cautios that you don't slip

Now the reasons I would join the ship. It says that Luke had fun on the boat, the cowboys played volleyball games. They also had table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling,and games also helped pass the time.

If I had the choice to become a Seagoing Cowboy, I wouldn't go. I would miss all my friends and family. And yes you would have a lot of fun but, you couldn't see your friends. You couldn't see the people you wanted to see. And i'm happy where I live and where I go to school. I never want to leave. But for Luke it was something I guess he wanated to do.

E6338A929654,"Hey there!  As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write this essay on how self-reliance leads to success in life. 

So, let's dive right in! Self-reliance is like, totally important for achieving happiness and success in life. When we're able to make our own decisions and rely on ourselves, we feel more in control of our lives. Like, instead of always having to listen to what our parents or teachers tell us, we can make our own choices and figure things out for ourselves.

But, at the same time, having the freedom to make our own decisions can also be kinda scary. Like, what if we make the wrong choice and it doesn't turn out good?  So, it's important to find a balance between being independent and having someone to guide us.

For example, when we're little, our parents make a lot of decisions for us because we can't do things on our own yet. But as we get older, we start to learn how to make our own choices and take care of ourselves. That's when we start to feel really happy and confident.

On the other hand, when we're not allowed to make our own decisions, it can be really frustrating. Like, if our parents always tell us what to do and never let us have a say in things, we might feel like we're not in control of our own lives. That can lead to unhappiness and even depression.

So, it's important to find a balance between being independent and having someone to guide us. When we're able to make our own decisions and rely on ourselves, we feel more in control of our lives and more likely to be happy. But when we're not given the freedom to make our own choices, we might feel like we're not being heard or respected.

In conclusion, self-reliance is super important for success and happiness in life. It's all about finding that balance between being independent and having someone to guide us.

llama_70b_v1470,"Hey there, fellow citizens! Today, I'm here to talk about the advantages of limiting car usage. Now, I know some of you might be thinking, ""But why should I limit my car usage? It's convenient and gets me where I need to go!"" And I get it, cars can be super helpful. But let me tell you, there are some really cool benefits to limiting car usage that you might not know about.

First of all, limiting car usage can help reduce air pollution. Cars emit harmful chemicals into the air, like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. By using public transportation, biking, or walking instead, we can significantly reduce the amount of air pollution in our cities. Plus, it's a great way to reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help reduce traffic congestion. Have you ever been stuck in a traffic jam and thought, ""Man, I wish I could just teleport to work!""? Well, by using alternative modes of transportation, we can help reduce the number of cars on the road, which can lead to fewer traffic jams and a smoother commute. It's a win-win!

But that's not all, folks. Limiting car usage can also help promote physical activity. By walking, biking, or taking public transportation, we can get some exercise and stay healthy. And let's be real, who doesn't love the feeling of a brisk walk or bike ride on a beautiful day? It's a great way to clear our minds and get some fresh air.

Now, I know some of you might be thinking, ""Okay, this all sounds great, but what about when I need to go somewhere far away?"" Well, that's where public transportation comes in. By using buses, trains, and subways, we can easily get to places that are too far to walk or bike. And many cities are investing in more efficient and sustainable public transportation systems, so it's getting easier and easier to get around without a car.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has some amazing benefits for our health, our environment, and our cities. By using alternative modes of transportation, we can reduce air pollution, traffic congestion, and promote physical activity. So next time you're thinking of how to get to work or school, consider leaving your car at home and trying out a new way to get around. Trust me, you might just find that you enjoy it!

E76B3F5205CD,"Title: The Power of Self-Reliance: Unlocking Success through Personal Responsibility

Introduction:
Hey there! As an 8th grader, I've learned that self-reliance is a crucial aspect of success. It's about taking responsibility for our own lives and actions, rather than relying on others. In this essay, I'll explore the concept of self-reliance, how it defines success, and the different ways to become more self-reliant. I'll also highlight famous people who have used self-reliance to achieve their goals and discuss the dangers of not prioritizing it.

Research:
Self-reliance is the ability to take care of oneself and one's responsibilities without relying on others. It involves being proactive, resourceful, and accountable for our actions. According to an article by Forbes, self-reliance is a key factor in achieving success, as it allows individuals to take control of their lives and make decisions that align with their goals and values.

Brainstorming Ideas:
To become more self-reliant, I can start by setting clear goals and working towards them. This means identifying what I want to achieve and creating a plan to make it happen. I can also practice self-care by taking care of my physical and mental health, which is essential for overall well-being. Additionally, I can learn new skills and take on new challenges to expand my knowledge and abilities.

Famous People:
Many successful people have used self-reliance to achieve their goals. For example, Oprah Winfrey, a billionaire media executive and philanthropist, credits her success to her self-reliance and determination. She started her career as a radio host and worked her way up to become one of the most influential women in media. Another example is Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, who has become a pioneer in the tech industry through his self-reliance and innovative thinking.

85E3C840FCBF,"Year-round schools have been a topic of discussion for many years. Some people believe that year-round schools are beneficial for both students and educators, while others believe that they are not. In this essay, I will examine the benefits of a year-round school and provide two reasons why it would be beneficial for students and educators.

Firstly, a year-round school can provide students with a more consistent learning schedule. In traditional schools, students have a set amount of time to learn during the school year, typically from September to May or June. However, during the summer months, students often forget what they learned during the school year. With a year-round school, students can continue learning throughout the year, which can help them retain the information they learned. This can be especially beneficial for students who struggle with learning or who need more time to understand the material.

For example, let's say a student is struggling to understand a particular math concept. In a traditional school, they may have to wait until the next school year to continue learning about that concept. However, with a year-round school, they can continue learning about that concept throughout the year, which can help them better understand the material and improve their grades.

Secondly, a year-round school can provide educators with a more consistent work schedule. In traditional schools, teachers have a set amount of time to teach during the school year, typically from August to May or June. However, during the summer months, teachers may have to work on other projects or take time off. With a year-round school, teachers can have a more consistent work schedule, which can help them better plan their lessons and improve their work-life balance.

For example, let's say a teacher is working on a project during the summer months. With a year-round school, they can continue working on that project throughout the year, which can help them better plan their time and improve their work-life balance.

In conclusion, a year-round school can provide students and educators with numerous benefits. By providing a more consistent learning schedule, year-round schools can help students retain the information they learned and improve their grades. Additionally, by providing a more consistent work schedule, year-round schools can help teachers better plan their lessons and improve their work-life balance.

7600F1C7D884,"Hey there!  So, I've been thinking a lot about this whole homeschooling vs traditional school thing, and I gotta say, it's pretty interesting. I mean, both options have their pros and cons, you know?

First off, let's talk about homeschooling.  One of the biggest advantages of homeschooling is that you get to learn at your own pace. Like, if you're really good at math, you can speed through it and focus more on the stuff you're not as good at. Plus, you don't have to deal with annoying kids in class who always distract you.  And, you know, you can take breaks whenever you want. Like, if you're feeling really tired, you can just take a nap and then come back to your lessons. 

But, there are also some disadvantages to homeschooling.  One of them is that you don't get to socialize as much as you would in a traditional school. Like, you don't get to make new friends or join clubs and stuff. And, sometimes it can be hard to find cool stuff to learn about since you don't have a teacher to guide you. 

Now, let's talk about traditional school.  One of the best things about traditional school is that you get to learn from teachers who are experts in their fields. Like, they know a lot about math, science, and history, and they can teach you really cool stuff. Plus, you get to hang out with your friends and make new ones. And, you know, there are tons of extracurricular activities you can join, like sports, music, and art. 

But, there are also some downsides to traditional school.  One of them is that you have to deal with bullies and mean kids who can make school really hard. And, sometimes you have to take classes that you're not interested in, like gym or lunch detention.

B7C150A40F86,"As an 8th grader, I believe that completing the traditional four years of high school before graduating has numerous benefits that prepare students for their future. The extra time in high school allows students to explore their interests, develop their skills, and gain valuable experiences that can help them succeed in college and their career.

Firstly, the extra time in high school gives students the opportunity to take advanced courses, such as AP or IB classes, which can help them stand out on college applications and demonstrate their academic abilities. These classes also provide students with a taste of college-level work, which can help them adjust to the rigor of college coursework and feel more prepared for the academic demands of higher education. Additionally, the extra time in high school allows students to explore different career paths and interests through internships, job shadowing, or extracurricular activities, which can help them identify their passions and make informed decisions about their future.

Furthermore, the extra time in high school can help students develop important life skills, such as time management, organization, and responsibility. By taking a more relaxed pace in high school, students can learn how to balance their academic and extracurricular activities, which can help them become more independent and self-sufficient. This can also help them develop good study habits and time management skills, which are essential for success in college and their future careers.

Another benefit of completing the traditional four years of high school is the opportunity for students to have more time for rest and relaxation during the summer. While some students may view summer as a time to work or take on internships, many students benefit from having a break from the structured environment of high school. This can help them recharge their batteries, spend time with family and friends, and engage in activities that they enjoy. This can also help students avoid burnout and maintain their motivation and enthusiasm for learning.

On the other hand, rushing to graduate high school can have several disadvantages. For example, students who rush to graduate may not have enough time to take advantage of opportunities to explore their interests, develop their skills, or gain valuable experiences. This can limit their options and make it more difficult for them to identify their passions and make informed decisions about their future. Additionally, rushing to graduate can lead to",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

54B9CFA95D80,"Fellow citizens, cars have become a major role in our daily lives. They have their many excellent uses, however there are advantages of limiting that usage. To name a few are, that it's enviromentally healthier and it's less money you have to spend on them. Now let me explain why it's a smart choice to take advantage of limited usage of cars.

Paris recently (according to source two article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer) came up with a brilliant idea of partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. They took days were only even or odd liscense plated cars would drive or they would suffer a fine. However public transit was free throughout the week. This promoted less congestion and smog which is much better for the enviorment by lowering the amount of pollution in the ozone layer. As well as a cheaper way to commute. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". This shows just how out of hand the smog had gotten but with limiting the amount of cars used they managed to clear over half of it! Making the world greener than before.

Meanwhile in places such as Vauban, Germany, the residents went as far as giving up there cars. (according to source one article ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"" By Elisabeth Rosenthal) About 70% of the residents no longer own cars because it's either too expensive to have one on the edge of town and it's generally forbidden in this experiment in the new distirct. They even go as far as to say that it's better without having one. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter,a resident in Vauban according to the article. People in general, especially the younger generations don't use cars or have liscenes in comparison to older people who are more likely to retain their liscenses as the age was shown in research. People now don't care as much as what cars are driven but are more focused to get from point A to point B, it's simply a means of transportation. (In source 4 article ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal).

When it comes down to it, cars are transportation, but there are plenty of other means of transport that are free or cheaper such as buses, trains, bikes or even car pooling. While at the same time creating less pollution and congestion, making it enviromentally healthier.                                            ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
DE1EF5A9F3AA,"The Electoral College is a system of electing our president created by our founding fathers when they were writing the Constitution.  Lately though, people have opposed the Electoral College due to the election when Al Gore beat George Bush in the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote(and a seat as President.)

Based on many sources, I do not support the Electoral College because of the lack of a direct link from the public to the election of the president and the unfairness of it towards voters.

I do not support the Electoral College because of a lack of a direct link from the public to the election of the president.  Instead of the public voting for the president, they are voting for a group of electors who, in turn, elect the president.  The problem with that is that the group of electors can be anyone not holding the public office.  But just in case of dishonest electors, states hold state conventions to pick the electors.  But even after this, voters still can not control who their state's electors vote for.  Sometimes, electors get confused about who someone voted for and put them down for a candidate different from whom they originally voted for.  Now we could avoid all this trouble if we just did away with Electoral College and had a direct vote for president, and have the election ""by the people and for the people"" instead of ""by the people and for the electors.""

I do not support the Electoral College because of the unfairness of it towards the voters.  Due to the winner take all system in each state, candidates for president don't focus on winning every state.  Instead, they focus on only winning the ""swing"" states, or, states whose political party support is constantly changing.  In the presidential election of 2000, the presidential candidates didn't see 17 states(including, but not limited to, Rhode Island and South Carolina) and 25 of the largest media markets' voters didn't see a single presidential campaign ad.  This is another good reason to get rid of the Electoral College.

Based on this evidence, I believe the Elelectoral College should be done away with because of a lack of a direct link to the election of the president and the unfairness of it towards voters.     ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

25C966D084EF,"""America for the people, by the people"". Dear senators in which who favor keeping the Electoral College of the United States. Ask yourself this question ""if this country was made for the people, by the people, why aren't we allowed to vote for our own president""?

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It's time for change.

To begin with, the principles of America were made under the intention to create a country of equality. This electoral college has created a boundary between the people and it's government. Under the electoral college system, voters vote for not the president, but for a slate elector, who in turn elects the president. By this doing are voice aren't being heard. It's like giving a homeless person five-dollars, we don't know where are money is going. This system needs to be replaced by the popular vote, so that are voice could be heard.

To continue, this system is extremely outdated. The fact that our founding fathers established it in the Constitution, as a comprimse between election of the president, is living proof how outdated this system is. This system runs like zombie after the crash of a 5 hours energy drink. Heck, this system is so old, my grandma remebers the day it was established, like it was yesterday. Although this rustbucket is old, the worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, and still not by the hands of ""the people"". We demand change!

Although some may say, this systems prevents a bunch of yahoo's from voting. Everyone desevere their take on the subject of matter. There's an adge saying "" the one's you don't expects to learn from, can teach you the most"". After all it is our right to vote, as it is promise in the Constitution. The electoral system is an irrational system. It's basically like a slap in the face. A way of the government saying we're a bunch of dodo birds, that are incapable of voting.

In conclusion, It's official, the electoral college is unfair, extremely outdated, and irrational. The world is changing around us and it's time to adapt. Instead of ""pointing guns at eachother"", we need to assemble. ""Give me freedom or give me death"". Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
94728AA2B9D6,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I recently heard that you have been considering changing the grade average required in order to participate in sports or other school activities. Right now the average grade must be a C or higher in order to participate in some school activities. I believe it is a wise decision to change the requirement from a C to a B. By doing this, you will push your students harder to achieve their goals and end up with a higher amount of kids getting B' s!

I am currently a member of the schools wrestling team and I know that I would not want to come to school on some days if it weren't for wrestling practice. I can tell you that every other member on the wrestling team feels exactly the same way! If you challenged those kids to get a B average I am sure they would do their very best. This would teach them discipline and let them know that they are rewarded for good schoolwork. The students might feel like they are only trying in school so that they can partake in school activities but truly they will be helping themselves in the long run as well!

Once your students get to a high school or college they will soon learn that they need to get their grades as high as possible in order to be as successful as you want. By giving them these goals early, they will be preparing for what is soon to come. Also, when your students are in high school and are succeeding in their classes you will receive recognition for teaching them their ways.

I know that you will make the choice that you believe is best for the students and best for the school. I believe that you should change the grade average requirement to a B because more kids will persevere to get their grades up to a B and help them prepare for their future school experiences. It is important to teach your students that they are rewarded for good work and that doing good in school can only lead to more good things.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
855398650C01,"I believe that the Facial Action Coding Sydtem could work. From what I read, it is pretty high tech and they know what they are doing. If they ad these to classrooms to tell how boring or fun they are and how to make them better I think some kids would actually want to go to class. There are three things I think really make this possible,and they are muscle scanning, used for interigation, and making class better.

This first reason is very good. The muscles in faces can really tell the actual expression of an individual or even an entire class. In paragraph 3, line 2, the author says, ""All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This means it uses 44 different muscles in the face to figure out someones emotions. This can be very accurate it seems like, if you have an investigation and you have 44 pieces of evidence, how likely are you going to be right? Very likely.

That brings me to my next example, interigation. imagine you have 8 people who have been caught and there was a murder. If you ask all 8 of them I garantee you will figure out who murdered the person. In paragraph 7, line 12, the text states, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This can tell you if a person is lying or not, along with a couple other factors. Lets say someone is being asked a couple questions, if they asked the person if he broke into a house recently they can tell if his stress levels are high.

Then we can also make class better with this facial scan. If they put this into a classroom more kids would want to go to class because it can make class better. But it can also have some down sides. Some teachers might use it to be more serious and less fun. Then kids wouldn't want to go to school and just stay home. But if the classroom is more fun and less stressful the kids won't learn as much. In paragraph 6 line, the texts says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" this means they can have the computer tell them what they are doing wrong and change it to where the classroom is fun but you also get alot of learning in.

This is why I think it could work. this is a very smart idea for the future and I think that most people would like this idea too. It can really change the future and these are three ways I think its a good idea.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
6B3A8DAB21EB,"Working in a group or working alone has been a topic of debate among people for a long time. While some people believe that working alone is the best way to get things done, others argue that working in a group has its own set of benefits. In this essay, I will be comparing the benefits of working in a group versus working alone and arguing that working in a group is more advantageous in certain situations.

One of the main benefits of working in a group is the ability to share ideas and perspectives. When working alone, it can be easy to get stuck in your own way of thinking and miss out on new ideas or solutions. However, when working in a group, you have the opportunity to bounce ideas off of each other and get different perspectives on a problem. This can lead to more creative and innovative solutions.

Another benefit of working in a group is the ability to divide and conquer tasks. When working alone, it can be overwhelming to tackle a large project or task. However, when working in a group, you can divide the work among the members and each person can focus on their own task. This can help to get things done more efficiently and effectively.

In addition to these benefits, working in a group can also help to build relationships and improve communication skills. When working in a group, you have the opportunity to interact with people from different backgrounds and learn how to effectively communicate with them. This can help to build stronger relationships and improve your overall communication skills.

One example of how working in a group can be more advantageous than working alone is in a school project. When working on a school project with a group of classmates, you have the opportunity to share ideas and perspectives, divide the work among the members, and build relationships with your classmates. This can help to ensure that the project is completed successfully and that you learn valuable skills that can be applied in the future.

In conclusion, while working alone has its own set of benefits, working in a group has its own set of advantages. The ability to share ideas and perspectives, divide and conquer tasks, and build relationships and improve communication skills are all benefits of working in a group. These benefits can be especially advantageous in situations such as school projects or group projects in the workplace.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0
5B66541ADDCD,"Hello everyone I am Luke the Seagoing Cowboy. Today. I think it will be a great opportunity for you too by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. And here let me tell you why.

I started with a help of my friend because I had no choice. He introduced me after the world war II where people still live in the ruins and are starving. It was a good thing for me back then because I had no hope. And that is how it started.

When i joined the program it was hard definaty it a job after all my main purpose was to go of to the seas to another country and help poeple in needs. Through that I was able to go to alot of places, but moving wasent a easy job. I had time when I broke my ribs and could not even work for our crew and that is not all the tides in the oceans are strong very strong and if you were the night watcher too bad. I turned 18 when i was in way to Greece. I was able to be darte d for military service and they said to countine my military service. I also admit but it was a great oppertunity for me. There is also a fun side. When all the cattles were gone our crew was able to stay and play games like vollyball tabletennis,boardgames and lot more it is definatly worth it do ing hard work for all that. You could also tour the citys I visited the Acropolis,the Gondola ride in Venice,excavaded castle in Crete,Panama Canal an the way to China. So now lets go to the actuall reasons why you should join the program:

1. You can tour big places while you are there. That is one of the big reasons I joined the program 2. You can really be aware of waht is going on. I saw th ruins and it was really bad horrible all houses colasped...

3. You can help people in need and are starving for food even though they did not do any thing wrong. I felt really pitty for them beacase the war has not started because of them and they are starvng well for no reason.

I really think that you guys should join the program,ofcourse there are though times, but seeing people get satisfied by my work and visting places for free it is definatly worth at least trying out for this program. This program changed my life it might change yours too.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
318F40822873,"Along with the growing influence of technology in society comes the availability to use it to transform the way in which students are educated. With the use of technology, students could be given the responsibility and freedom to complete classes online rather than having to come into school five times a week. However, not all students have the focus and determination like others to be able to hold themselves accountable for completing their classes at home without a physical instructor. Despite this, I think students would benefit from being able to take online classes at home, rather than at school, as it would give students the opportunity to learn at their own appropriate pace and it would provide a more comfortable learning environment with less distractions.

While in the classroom, it is difficult for teachers to go at a pace that isn't too slow or too fast for every single student since not every student learns at the same pace. I consider myself a relatively slow learner and writer. Therefore, there have been several instances where my teachers would be lecturing and giving notes, and I found myself missing key information because the teacher was not allowing time for us to write it down. However, unlike my other teachers, my history teacher will make us take notes at home. In this instance, taking notes and learning from home, helped me retain and learn the information better than if I were at school because I was not constantly stressing about the teacher switching the slides, and therefore, potentially missing key concepts. Giving students the opportunity to learn from home allows students to make sure they get all of the necessary information that they may need for later success on a test. It also gives students time to be able to make sure that they understand the information on the notes, rather than just typing or writing it down without understanding the meaning behind it. In addition, some of my teachers make assignments due at the end of class, despite some students, like myself, not being able to finish within the time constraint. Although I understand that it is important to be able to complete assignments quickly for the future, I think that in a learning environment that should not be the case. Learning is not about being able to complete an assignment in an hour, but it is about being able to understand new information. Therefore, I think learning from home provides the best learning environment for every student to do well in their education, since they don't have to constantly be overshadowed with the stress of time on important assignments. At home, students are able to ensure that they turn in quality work that will help improve their grades rather than hurt it because of a time constraint. Students should be given the opportunity to take classes from home because not every student learns identically and as quickly as others.

In the event that students would be able to take classes from home, they would also be able to learn in an environment that ensures their greatest focus and success. However, this can be difficult when there are constant distractions in the classroom. For example, in my Pre-Calculus class, there is a specific group of students who are constantly found talking over the teacher as she is trying to teach. Not only does this distract the teacher, but it also distracts me and the other students who are trying to learn the material. To avoid instances like this, students should be able to learn at home where they can sit in a room all by themselves, free from any outside noises or distractions that may hinder their learning. Other students, and sometimes teachers, are simply just added distractions that make it even more difficult for students to focus on learning the information that the teacher is trying to teach to the class. Similarly, while in my AP Chemistry class, since I am usually one of the last students to finish the test, there is always a constant moving of students and whispering among the inconsiderate students who cause me to lose focus. It is very challenging for students to concentrate on their thoughts when they are followed by constant whispering and movement going on in the classroom. These distraction may cause students to either get the question wrong or run out of time, therefore, hurting their education. Furthermore, I constantly find myself being more focused doing my homework rather than trying to do my work in school because I am given an appropriate and quiet learning space that helps me concentrate on what I am doing. Allowing students to learn from the comfort of their home helps minimize the many potential distractions from other students and teachers that only cause problems with the student's concentration.

While trusting students to learn independently may not be appropriate for every student, it can be an important quality for other students to learn the importance of being responsible for their future. Many high school and college classes have leaned greatly towards using technology for student's to complete and turn in assignments. Nowadays, teachers and professors are mostly used for lecturing which can easily be transmitted online. Therefore, as the years progress, and technology grows to be more influential on society, schools should consider taking advantage of technology to ensure a better educational system for every type of student.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Title: The Socioeconomic Environment of Generic_City: An Immigrant's Perspective

As an 8th grader, I recently moved to Generic_City from my home country in search of better opportunities. My family and I were excited to start a new life in this bustling metropolis, but we quickly realized that it was not without its challenges. In this essay, I will analyze the socioeconomic environment of Generic_City, focusing on employment prospects, education, government leadership, and general resources available. I will also reflect on my own experience of leaving my home country and the opportunities and obstacles I have encountered.

Employment Prospects:

Generic_City has a diverse economy with a variety of job opportunities, but it can be challenging for immigrants to find work, especially those who do not speak the local language fluently. Many companies require proficiency in English, which can make it difficult for immigrants to secure employment. However, there are some organizations that offer language training programs to help immigrants improve their language skills and increase their chances of finding a job.

Education:

The education system in Generic_City is well-developed, and there are many excellent schools to choose from. However, the language barrier can be a significant obstacle for immigrant students, especially in the early years of schooling. Many schools offer language support programs to help immigrant students adjust to the curriculum, but it can take time for them to catch up with their peers.

Government Leadership:

The government of Generic_City is committed to supporting immigrants and providing them with the resources they need to succeed. There are many programs and services available to help immigrants settle into their new lives, including language classes, job training programs, and social services. However, there can be bureaucratic red tape to navigate, which can be frustrating for immigrants who are just trying to get by.

General Resources:

Generic_City has a vibrant cultural scene, with many museums, art galleries, and recreational activities available. However, it can",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

6CBF5570EF1D,"A ""car free"" community has many advantages. They will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases. They will also help you save more money by not having to pay for a car, and if you do, you can park it in a garage for $40,000. This will also expand other transportation and will have a new six-year federal transportation bill. There is no disadvantages for having a ""car-free"" community. Many countries and cities are participating in limiting car usage to make the air better and cleaner.

First, and most important, is that reducing cars also reduces the greenhouse gas emmision. People that participate in this are most likely doing it to make the air we breath better. In some over-populated cities, the amount of smog is crazy. After just one day without some cars, the amount of smog dissapeared. London had the idea for even-numbered license plates to be banned to drive one day, even though some people still used their cars. So more than half the cars are still on the road, and it reduced smog so much, they didn't even need to ban the odd numbered cars. This is the most important reason why people are limiting car usage.

Next, if you live in a car free community, you will never have to pay for your car. You can sell it to make more money becuase you will never have to use it. This is much better than owning a car and having to park it in a garage for $40,000. If you ever need to take the bus, you will have the money. With the extra money you can buy a bike also. The stores will be walking distances, so there is no need for a car. I think this is a great idea for not only a better community, but it would help people socialize with neighbors and it saves money while doing it. After World War II, the cities would start reconstructing around the car, but now that is beggining to change in Vauban, Germany.

Last, the cities are trying to expand public transportation, such as taxis and buses. It would promote these and play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have gone to highways by law and 20 percent have gone to other transportation. If the city bans cars, you can either walk, skate, bike, or ride the bus or taxi. In America, the amount of cars being bought and license plates being bought are decreasing since 1995. President Obama has an ambitious goal on which he unvieled last week and he wants to get rid of green house gas emmisions.

In conclusion, I think you would agree that limiting car usage has its advantages. It reduces greenhouse gases and also smog. After one day, Paris was clear of gas and smog in the air. The gas gets caught under the atmosphere and is dangerous. Limiting car usage also will help you save money because you no longer will have a car to pay for. Also, it would boost other forms of transportation, such as buses and taxis. This is a great idea to limit cars.         ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
997D5145CB33,"No! The natural landform was not made by any kind of alien in Mars. It is just a landform that appended to look like a human face. And if im saying if it was made by aliens there is nothing that proves it to be made by aliens. Heck there isnt any at proves or gives an idea that aliens actually exist. But there is a lot of evidence that proves that the face was made naturally and is just a landform that happened to look like one. A few of them are we sent ""Mars Global Suveyor"" and it showed no sign of alien monument, there was a good picture taken of the area of the landform, and lastly if there was any signs of aliens or their artifacts we would want to know and explore it like you would. i will list and prove in the following paragraphs why it is just a landform.

First, when we sent the

"" Mars Global Surveyor"" it arrived in eghteen years in September 1997. When the Surveyor was flyiing over Mars it found the face and as soon at it was clear we took pictures of it. On April 1998 the Surveyor flew over and took a nice shot at the face. This shot was ten times better the the first shot taken.

secont, Thanks to the picture taken by the surveyor we could now look for small details by the face. For each pixel in the 2001 the image spans ""1.56 meters that compared to 43 meters per pixel."" in the picture you can look three times closer thanks to pixels. That means that if take a picture like that you should be ablie to see big objects for example airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small homes or shacks.

You might say that we NASA are trying to keep things secret from all of you in the publice and that we just want to keep the discovery of aliens to our selfs. But the truth is we don't we want you to know everything we know and we want to find any sign of alien life like artifacts and shacks and technology, but the fact is that the face in Mars has no prove theres nothing by the face that proves that any type of life built it. there was no left over material or any tools left the simple fact is that the face was made naturally and it is a landform like the ones we have on earth. Just this landform happened to look like us like a human.

In conlusion the face on

Mars will and should be considered a landfom. If it was made by aliens we would have found out thanks to all these studys but all of the studys we have made have proven there to be no life on the planet Mars. But I want to challenge you to conduct you own studys think of new ways and send them to us if this is what it takes to prove that there are or arent aliens on the planet Mars then lets work together and prove one or the other about the Face that could be a land form or could be a artifact.

3C26EC679114,"With the advancement of technology and increased accessibility of the internet comes many possible positive changes. One of these possible positive changes is distance learning: a way to attend school from home through online conferences. Some schools offer this new way of learning, but should more schools transfer to this method? Schools should implement distance learning into their curriculum because it will benefit students by being extremely convenient, providing a comfortable setting, and creating a safer community.

Distance learning is very convenient. Say someone misses a school day because of sickness. Well, with distance learning, said student could still catch up and follow classes through online calls. It would be as if that student was right there alongside the rest of the class. Many schools in Asia have switched to online learning due to the Coronavirus outbreaks and high chance of being infected. Online classes are very convenient because these students are able to use the power of technology to continue their studies. It's also convenient for teachers as they do not have to stress about make up work or students needing to catch up. Sickness may be a one time thing; what if someone has a physical disability that makes it extremely difficult to travel to different places? Online classes is extremely convenient for a person with disabilities because not only do they not have to worry about traveling, they can learn from the comfort of a familiar place like their own home.

Comfort plays a big role on determining how well a person does. It is common knowledge that people perform better in a familiar, comfortable work environments than one that is uncomfortable. When discomfort is taken out of daily routines, the energy used to combat discomfort would instead be used to focus on something else. For example, my mother cannot sleep soundly anywhere that is not her own bed the first night because she isn't used to the bed yet. This leads to not enough sleep. However, if it was her own bed, she wouldn't have had to worry about discomfort and instead the energy that would've been used for feeling uncomfortable would be used to sleep well. Similarly, the comforts of a student's home and pajamas will yield better grades because the energy they would've used to get used to a different setting and time used to put together an outfit would be used to pay attention in class and understand new class material.

Online schooling is a safer alternative to going to school. It is safer for the environment and for students. Schools are trying to go paperless to help the environment but if school itself is online, not only is paper being saved, but pollution will decrease due to the lack of school buses, cars, and other means of transportation. With the doom of climate change approaching, anything should be done to at least postpone it, online classes are one way of doing so. Benefiting the environment indirectly benefits students, but a way that online classes are directly beneficial is violence in schools would decrease. With everyone safe at home, bomb threats, school shootings, and other forms of violence would decrease, if not disappear, entirely. The extermination of school-related violence would make students more eager to learn because they do not have to keep their guard up at all times; once again, using that energy to good use: studying.

Online schooling is an incredible way to utilize technological advancements to good use. The convenience of technology is unbeatable and making school online would make everyone's life easier. Comfort plays a major role in making staying at home and learning convenient. Online schooling is especially beneficial because it is so much safer. Though there will always be benefits to in-building schooling, school through online calls and conferences will always be superior and beneficial to students due to its convenience, comfort, and safety. ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
D94C5A4EBEDF,"Should teachers pick students summer projects, or should the students pick their own? School systems are beginning to give students projects over the summer. This idea will constantly keep the students involved and learning. The summer projects should be teacher-designed because it prepares the students for the upcoming year, it prepares the students for the workforce, and it gives constant interactions with the material for the upcoming year.

First, the reason why the summer projects should be teacher-designed is because the students would be ready for the upcoming year. If the teachers design the projects the students will be used to him/her giving them instructions. For example, if Generic_Name was not assigned his own project, and he picked his own it might pick a easy project which he would not put all his effort into. However, if Generic_Name was assigned a project by his teacher he would not have any other choice, so he would be more efficient with his time and work. One can easily see that if the teachers pick the summer projects it would be more effective.

Second, another reason why the summer projects should be assigned by teachers is because it would prepare the students for the workforce. If students had the choice of what summer project to do it would not prepare them for the workforce. For example, if Generic_Name has a job at the local Burger King, and his boss says ""clean the grill""

he has to do it or he will lose his job. If the summer projects are teacher-assigned Generic_Name would be used to being assigned a responsibility. It is obvious that the summer projects should be a teachers decision instead of allowing the students to decide their own summer project.

Lastly, the last reason why teachers should assign the summer projects is because it will give the student constant interactions with the material for the upcoming school year. If the students have the choice on their own summer projects it would not help them with the upcoming semester. With the teacher-assigned summer projects the students would know what to prepare for in the upcoming year, and have an idea of what they're learning. For example, if Generic_Name choose her own project should would not have any idea what she would be learning that upcoming semester. However, if her teachers assigned her project she would have an idea of what she would be learning. One can easily see that allowing the teachers to assign the students projects that it would be more beneficial.

Others would argue that the students should chose their own projects because they could pick something they enjoy,it builds responsibility, and it teaches the students how to make their own decisions. However, the teacher-assigned summer projects are more effective. The students summer projects should be assigned by the teachers because it prepares them for the upcoming year, prepares them for the workforce, and it has the students in constant interactions with the material for the upcoming semester. If students pick their own summer projects they will struggle during their next school year, so call your local school board, and sign the petition for the teacher-assigned summer projects. ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
16D2B327B978,"Students may view school as an obligation, wishing that they could just stay home all day and relax. At first, the introduction of allowing students to learn through a computer screen in the comfort of their own home may seem like an excellent idea, however, after a while students may begin to feel lonely and as if they are not benefiting much from it. I think that students would not benefit from an at home learning system due to the fact that a face to face learning experience is much more efficient than one behind a screen.

There are lots of students that are home schooled, which does not allow them to have a real school like experience. For most of society, having the school experience taught them things, such as work ethic, time management, how to deal with people, and much more. If a student does online schooling through video calls and conferences, they are just like home schooled students, meaning they will not receive the benefit of having a school experience. For some, the school experience may not have been as pleasing as it was for others, but everyone has gone to a physical school got to make mistakes, learn from them, and apply it to their life later on. If a student goes to school through an online program, they will have not gotten to learn from the experience of being in a physical school, which could cause them incredible difficulties later on, such as the social aspect of life.

A big part of society is social interaction. It has been proved that humans need social interaction to live happily, and if they don't get that, it can have some very bad consequences. For some criminals, the government will put them into isolation as a form of punishment, meaning no interaction with other humans for a period of time. This is a form of punishment due to the fact that humans need the social aspect of life in order to mentally survive. Even though classes through video calls and conferences is nowhere near as bad as isolation is, they may not have many friends outside of their school unless it is because of a sports team or a community project they are involved in. Students who participate in public school are constantly interacting with their peers and teachers, asking questions, talking to friends in the hallways, and so much more. It is through school that so many students have formed close and solid friend groups, who go and hangout on a Friday or Saturday night. Those who do school online find it much harder to make close friends, and this is due to the fact that they are not around their peers all the time, which makes them have to put in a lot more work to find friends to hangout with. Those who are able to form close social bonds with people through school is a reason why students benefit much more by physically going to school rather than an online video call or conference.

Another reason as to why physically attending school is significantly more beneficial than doing classes online is because of the interactive and hands on experience students receive. In classrooms, students get the chance to learn through interaction by participating in labs, presentations, class discussions, and many other interactive experiences. Students can use presentations and class discussions to bounce ideas off of each other, and if a student has a question after a lesson, they do not have to email or call the teacher back, they can simply go up and ask to get the information they need right away. There are lots of students who state that they learn better through visuals and hands on experiences. Those who take classes at home do not have the opportunity to have a real hands on learning experience, which for some could alter how much material their brain actually grasps on to. Students would not be able to physically pick apart the subject they are learning, especially in science areas, which could lead them to not obtain as much information as they could have with an interactive experience.

Having a physical in class learning experience is much more beneficial than one over the internet due to the school experience students receive, the social interaction, and the hands on learning they get to experience. However, even though there is much evidence to backup why going to a classroom to learn is better, it can be stated that learning online through video calls is the way to go. If students have anxiety or are constantly stressed out, learning online may be a much more relaxing way to gain material. Since there is so much more reasoning as to why a physical learning system is so much better than an online one, all evidence gathered to support this overpowers any evidence to support doing classes online. Because of the evidence and reasoning presented, having a physical learning experience is incredibly more beneficial having a learning system online. ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
falcon_180b_v1_132,"I believe that students would benefit from attending classes from home through distance learning. There are several reasons for my position.

Firstly, some students may live far away from school and have to travel a long distance to attend classes. This can be tiring and time-consuming, especially if they have to wake up early in the morning. By attending classes from home, they can save time and energy, and be more alert during lessons.

Secondly, students who are sick or have a disability may find it difficult to go to school regularly. Distance learning would allow them to participate in classes without having to worry about physical obstacles or health issues.

Thirdly, some students may have other commitments such as sports or music practice, which can make it difficult for them to attend school regularly. Distance learning would provide them with the flexibility to attend classes at a time that suits them, while still being able to pursue their other interests.

Finally, distance learning can also help students to develop important skills such as time management, self-discipline, and independent learning. These skills will be valuable for them in the future, especially if they plan to pursue higher education or work remotely.

In conclusion, I believe that distance learning is a great option for students who need more flexibility in their schedule or who may face physical obstacles in attending school regularly. It can also help them to develop important skills that will be useful in the future.",1,falcon_180b_v1,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

EC3B982A622A,"The thought of extending the school day by 30 minutes can be a difficult one to consider for both students and teachers alike. On one hand, it could be beneficial to dedicate more time for in-depth conversations in the classroom and allow more time for teachers to go over complex concepts. Additionally, it could also give students more opportunity to ask questions and get help from their peers and teachers.

However, on the other hand, it might be detrimental to students and teachers alike. Having to stay in school for an additional half an hour can tire out both teachers and students, leading to lack of motivation and a decrease in concentration. Also, this could lead to a decrease in extracurricular activities or have to begin them even earlier, thus diminishing an important part of the school day for students.

At the end of the day, extending the school day by 30 minutes can have both its benefits and drawbacks. Before making any solid commitment to this, it is important to consider the opinions of both the teachers and the students, as the ramifications to this decision are far-reaching.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Write an essay evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of extending the school day by 30 minutes.,4
E91431653DE3,"In a world increasingly driven by conformity, it can be difficult to stay true to oneself. We are constantly bombarded by societal pressures to fit in, and many of us feel obligated to obey the norms set by powerful mainstream entities. However, there is an underlying importance to individuality which cannot be overstated, especially in modern society. Despite the temptation to follow the crowd, standing out and embracing one’s unique identity can often lead to greater success.

It is necessary to consider Waldo Ralph Waldo Emerson’s perspective on being an individual when discussing this issue. According to Emerson, fitting in is a detrimental force which seeks to suppress individuality, and he argues that we should instead strive to stand out and honor our individual selves. While this philosophy certainly provides an admirable model for personal development, it is important to remember that individual expression in modern society is not as easily facilitated as it may have been in Emerson’s era. With the advent of new forms of media and constant bombardment of constructed ideals, it can often be more difficult for an individual to break through the noise and gain recognition for their talents.

Ultimately, it is important to remember that there is still value in individuality, regardless of the obstacles that may stand in the way. It is paramount to remember that while conformity is often rewarded in the short-term, being one’s authentic self can often lead to longer-term success. Thus, despite the temptation to conform, it is important to consider the positive influence individual expression can have on one’s life and career.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

falcon_180b_v1_892,"I think we should transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. One reason is that renewable energy is better for the environment. Fossil fuels release harmful pollutants into the air and contribute to climate change. Renewable energy, on the other hand, doesn't produce any harmful emissions.

Another reason is that renewable energy is a sustainable resource. Fossil fuels are finite resources, which means they will eventually run out. Renewable energy, like solar and wind power, is constantly replenished and will never run out.

Finally, renewable energy is becoming more affordable and accessible. The cost of solar panels and wind turbines has decreased significantly in recent years, making it easier for individuals and businesses to invest in renewable energy.

An example of a successful transition to renewable energy is Costa Rica. In 2019, Costa Rica generated 98% of its electricity from renewable sources, primarily hydropower and geothermal. This has helped the country reduce its carbon footprint and become a leader in sustainable energy.

In conclusion, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a smart choice for our planet. It's better for the environment, sustainable, and becoming more affordable.

BEE04EB31D59,"Working in a group can be beneficial in many ways. For one, having more minds to work on a particular task can make the work more effective than if one person were to work on it alone. Working with a team can also help increase self-confidence, as there is a sense of support and encouragement from the other members when tackling a challenge. Lastly, working in a group has the added benefit of creating an environment where everyone can interact and exchange ideas openly rather than a single person needing to work in isolation. 

On the other hand, working alone has some advantages of its own. Most notably, one can maintain total control and responsibility for a project without having to consult other people about decisions which can be helpful for complex tasks. Additionally, when working in isolation, one can focus intently on the task without distractions from outside conversations. This can help improve the speed and accuracy of the work.

62243789233B,"In today's society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self.

Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called

Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so.

Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks don't turn out the way you wanted them too. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Another example is having a meeting for a job. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve.

Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve.

A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.",0,original_moth,"Task:

I'm super excited to write this essay about the importance of asking for help and guidance, talking to priors and family members, and having confidence in yourself when making important life decisions. Here are some scenarios that I think really illustrate my points:

Scenario 1: Choosing a High School

So, I'm in 8th grade and it's time to think about high schools. My parents are like, ""Hey, kiddo, you gotta start thinking about where you wanna go to high school!"" And I'm like, ""Uh, I don't know...where do I wanna go?""  My parents are like, ""Well, have you thought about this school or that school?"" And I'm like, ""Uh, no...I don't know anything about them."" It's like, I'm supposed to have all these opinions and ideas, but I don't! 

So, I ask my parents for help and guidance. They're like, ""Okay, let's do some research together!"" And we look up schools online and talk to friends who went to different schools. My parents help me think about what's important to me, like location and extracurriculars, and we narrow it down together. It's like, having them there to guide me makes me feel so much more confident in my decision. I'm like, ""Oh, I get it now!  I can't wait to go to high school!""

BF72FB4B953F,"Graduating from high school in three years has become an increasingly popular option for many students. While some may see the benefits of graduating early, others may argue that the emotional, physical, and mental stress of graduating in three years may not be worth it. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of graduating from high school in three years, and argue that it is ultimately not worth the stress.

One of the main benefits of graduating in three years is that it allows students to get a head start on their future. By graduating early, students can begin their post-secondary education or enter the workforce sooner, which can lead to more opportunities and higher earning potential in the long run. Additionally, graduating early can be a sense of accomplishment and pride for students, as they have achieved a significant milestone in their lives.

However, there are also several drawbacks to graduating in three years. One of the main drawbacks is the emotional stress that comes with graduating high school. For many students, high school is a time of significant change and growth, and graduating early can be a difficult and emotional experience. Additionally, graduating early may mean that students are not fully prepared for the challenges that come with post-secondary education or the workforce. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy or a lack of confidence in their abilities.

Another drawback of graduating in three years is the physical stress that comes with it. High school is a time of significant physical development, and graduating early may mean that students are not fully developed physically. This can lead to health issues later in life, and may also impact their ability to participate in certain activities or sports.

Finally, graduating in three years may not be financially beneficial for students. While graduating early can lead to more opportunities and higher earning potential in the long run, it may also mean that students have to take on more debt to pay for their post-secondary education or living expenses. This can be a significant financial burden for students, and may not be worth the benefits of graduating early.

In conclusion, graduating from high school in three years has both benefits and drawbacks. While it may allow students to get a head start on their future, it also comes with significant emotional, physical, and mental stress. Ultimately, it is not worth the stress for most students.

2823EC999322,"Mrs. Generic_Name just announced that all students must participate in one or more extracurricular activities. Everyone one doesn't know what they are are going to do now and disagrees with her. Me, myself agree's with Mrs. Generic_Name, however, most students do nothing after they get home for school. So, being in an extracurricular activity can be fun, you can do clubs, sports, and volunteering.

First, in clubs you can do a lot of interesting things. My brother is in FFA, and last spring break he went to Texas with his FFA club. They went to Forth Worth, Alabama, and Nashville. Which those place are very cool to go and visit. Then also in FFA you can do a CDE, which is where you can study about different things. I do small animal care therefore, you learn about different animals, diseases, and how to take care of an animal. Also if you're in a club you can make friends out of you state. I went to national convention this fall and meet a kid for Georgia and we still talk to this day.

Secondly, you can be in a sport. ""Sports make you blood flow"" as my mom would always tell me. That's why she would always like for me and my brother to play a sport. You're getting exercise when you are playing and getting exercise is good for your body. If you are doing a sport that you really enjoy, you could be an professional player. Being an professional means you're really good and enjoy doing what you do. By playing sports year after year you will make some friend that you probably didn't think you would be friend with. I play volleyball for a travel team and for JV and I've made some pretty close friends because I played year after year.

Lastly, you can volunteer. You can volunteer different places like the SPCA and fire fighter. Volunteering in your community by picking up trash. I volunteer at a SPCA ,I help the animals and take them for a walk. I feel like everyone should at least volunteer somewhere in there community because people are littering and not putting it in the trash can like they are suppose to. I've have always thought this in my head, "" We give to the community, the community will get back to the citizens.""

There are so much more busy people then there were 20 years ago.

Mrs. Generic_Name wants every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Yet, all of the student are disagreeing with her. But I think everyone should because, they won't do anything when they get home for school. Extracurricular activities are good for you. You can play a sport, volunteer, and be in a club.

DC8F1803CAA3,"Why waste time doing a project over the summer, that you had no part in deciding how it was designed? Summer, is a time of self enjoyment, and should be a break from school and doing boring assignments. However, teachers tend to assign students projects to do over the summer. With this in mind, many times teachers would assign projects that would take too much time and cause students to end up not doing it. This means, projects should be designed by students. At first, if students come up with their own projects, they can make it a reasonable amount of work where it does not stress them out to the point where they don't do it, but not terribly short and are able to finish it in 10 minutes. Next, having students design the project, allows them to control what they would like to learn and remember over the summer. Finally, giving students control, would increases the number of summer projects being completed.

First, procrastination is a very big problem on students. In countless cases, students in the Generic_City area, have a big summer project, and either do not know about it, or decide not to do it. For example, in the case of a student named Generic_Name, he had an English book report due over the summer. He was not informed by the teachers, so he never ended up doing it. This ended up causing him to start off at a lower grade the following year. If summer projects were student ran, he would have known that there was a summer project, and could of planned accordingly. In other cases, such as a student named Generic_Name, he knew about his English report by word of mouth, but decided not to do it because it was more work he felt the work load was overwhelming. If the students had designed the project, they could of made the project be a healthy amount of work that students know they could do it in a comfortable amount of time.

Next, one of the reasons on why student's tend to be very unprepared going into next year's class is, because they learn nothing from these projects. These projects that are given by teachers do not require them to learn anything to complete it. For example, a science teacher named Generic_Name, gave his students a big 20 page packet about rocks that he found online to do over the summer. He hopes this packet will teach them everything they need to know for the next year and get them ready. However, he is oblivious to his students taking advantage of this, and simply look up the answers online and be done with it. The whole point of the project would be wasted if students can just look up answers or copy it from a friend .The entire learning aspect from doing the project is negated. For example, if students could design it, they could have a project that would require students to find different types of rocks outside their home, take a picture of it ,and write a small description about it. This would accomplish the goal of a summer project. Giving students a way to learn about topics of the class in the summer, and disable the act to copy since everyone would have different types of pictures.

Finally, giving students the steering wheel for summer projects, would drastically increase the number of completed projects. A big reason why thousands of summer projects each year, were not being done, is because the students do not feel the project is worth their time. For example, why would you do a boring math packet over the summer, when you could just go to the beach and forget about it. Students have no emphasis on doing these projects. Now, if students had input on the project, they could make it something they seem worthy of doing, and put the time and effort into finishing it. This would help the students learn new information during the summer, and encourage more students to do the projects.

In conclusion, students should have control of summer projects and decide on how to do it. There are many reasons why this should be the case. Firstly, students can come up with projects that do not require them to stress about, and still actually finish them. Secondly, they could choose what they want to learn about over the summer, that way they don't waste the time copying their friends project and learn nothing. Lastly, the number completed projects would increase if students were given the creative license and control over their summer assignment. ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
75CF1D729EB9,"Dear Principle,

I suggest you go with policy 1 that will allow student to use their phone in school as long as it is off during class. This policy will cut down on the rates of people texting during class and maybe even bring some peoples grades up because they wont forget their work and can ask somebody to get it for them. It would reward the students for there hard work and their attention in class. There would be no more sneaking phones into class texting while the teacher is not looking. that way the can focus on their class work and they can understand it and get a good grade.

If you went with policy 2 then kids would sneak their phones into class and instead of focusing on their work their focusing on not getting caught. So now they don't how to do there homework and fail a test. If their not aloud to have phones at school then what will they do if they need to talk to their parents after school, or need to get a ride with friends. phone are almost a nessicty kids need to help them with school and other things out side of school.

I know she would be so happy if I become an actress.

Also, the Art and Performance Center has been the place of one of my favorites presentations,""The Rose"", the feelings that the esterpians transmit during the hold act are powerful; they make you feel that you are part o the show, or even better, they make you feel that is not a show.

Firstly, it frees up time in the student's life for personal activities and goals such as college visits, extracurricular activities, internships, and service projects. Secondly, taking four years to complete high school also gives students extra time to take elective courses that may not be available in three-year plans. This can give students a more well-rounded education and the opportunity to discover their passions. Additionally, by taking the extra year a student may feel more prepared for post-secondary education and they'll have had more time to strengthen their study habits. Lastly, a four-year plan can help maintain the quality of education and allow teachers more time for preparing and teaching their courses. Taking four years to complete high school can bring many benefits and should be considered a viable option.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

7B4B54F34B04,"Mona Lisa's facial expressions were ""determined"" by the Facial Action Coding System. It determined that she was ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery"" (D'Alto). This super high-tech machine can identify your emotions based on analyzing the muscles in your face. But is the technology really needed in classrooms?

The knowledge of emotional expressions to teachers can be very beneficial. Everyone knows that kids don't learn the same and keep up at the same pace. Teachers could use this for kids to know how comfortbale they are with the lesson. In the text it states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor'"" (D'Alto). This shows that FACS can help students who don't understand the lesson, by looking at their facial expressions, and changing the lesson to fit them.

Others would argue that facial expressions for every person and emotion are different. As the author pointed out in the text, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (D'Alto), people will disbelieve because not every person shows the same emotion the same way. Some oppossers would argue that the addition of the system to education would drastically bring up the cost. Making schools more expensive and put schools at an advantage.

Although I agree with the fact that not every face makes the same expression,

FACS can identify the way the muscles move to indicate the emotion. In the text it states, ""This process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" (D'Alto). This quote shows how the system works and to identify the muscle movement in your face. While, yes the cost of education will increase due to the addition of FACS, the benefits will outway the costs. Like any technological addition to schools, they use funds and sponsors to help pay for that stuff. Helping kids find a new way to learn and helping them succeed, seems a lot more important than costs.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System will help teachers and students world wide succeed. When teachers know how to fix their lessons based on how their students learn, it makes the job easier for them and they get to see their students grow. Although the FACS was able to identify Mona Lisa's facial expressions, they can be used for so much more in the real world.        ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
EF36F9497E96," I think Churchill's statement holds true. If success comes too easily, it can be easy to take for granted and not appreciate the hard work and effort that went into achieving it. Some people believe that they are invincible and will never fail, but I have always taken a different approach. I believe that failure is a valuable learning experience that can help us grow and improve.

In my experience, failure has been a crucial part of my journey to success. In my country, Vietnam, people often say that failure is the key to success. I have certainly experienced this firsthand. I have failed many times in my life, but I have always learned from my mistakes and continued to work towards my goals.

For example, when I was younger, I was really passionate about cooking and wanted to learn how to make a particular dish. I asked my mother for instructions, but of course, I made a lot of mistakes along the way. I wanted to give up, but I was determined to succeed. So, I continued to practice and eventually, I was able to make the dish perfectly.

In conclusion, I believe that failure is not something to be feared, but rather something to be embraced. It is a valuable opportunity to learn and grow, and can ultimately lead to greater success. As Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.""",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

9CA73E4BA19F,"Everyone knows that traveling outer space can be risky. Some many even say it is danergous. Others may say that we can come up with better technology to improve safety when traveling other planets in outer space. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author gives their support to the idea of exploring the planet Venus.

Traveling Venus would be dangerous in many ways. For one, it is the second planet closes to the sun so it would be extremely hot. Next, the air pressure would be quite hard for humans to handle as well. In the passage it states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This clearly gives enough information to say that these conditions are more extreme than what any human can handle.

A way we could be able to visit Venus is if we had better technology. NASA has had quite a few ideas for sending humans to Venus. In the text it says, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" By using this sort of vehicle humans would be able to make the trip survivable.

The author of this passage seems to be very open and supportive of the idea of studying and visting Venus. In the paragraph 8 the author claims, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovations."" From this authors statement we can infer that they are on board with the idea of the travels to Venus and that we should not like dangers or doubts hold us back from being able to study this planet. Although it may be challenging we must not let that stop us.

Although there may be many conflicting dangers and concerns with space travel, it is possible. As the author said, we should not let doubt stop us from discovering a great planet. We can come up with the technology to some day visit this planet. With the correct technology anything can be possible. ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

First the begin with talking about the technological side of it .In paragraph 1 they being to to talk about what the mona lisa was actually expressing through her facial expression by using FACS ( faical action coding system). The mona lisa is one of the most famous and staple pieces of art. Their have been many debates on if the mona lisa was happy and using this technology proved she was 83% happy. They used FACS to figure out her emotions from that exact moment. in paragraph 2 they begin to talk about the use of the FACS computer. How they use it to figure emotions for intance the mona lisa's emotion. The process isnt that hard use stand in front the computer and make facial expressions and the computer can figure it out for you.

Secondly they being to talk about facial expression. In paragraph 4 Dr. Huang talks about how facial expressions are universal. facial expressions are truly universal it is key on figuring out how others around you could be feeling. In paragraph 5 they talk about how humans come with an impressive calculation to what people may be feeling such as friend and how we can tell the difference between each emotion. Humans come with bein able to understand human emotions through expressions but not always seeing as people can mask true emotions for instance at one point he beings to talk about different smile and which is real and which is fake.

Lastly he beings to talk about how it would be useful in a classroom enviroment. In paragraph 6 they talk about how if a student is using a computer and the computer has FACS ( facial action coding systems) that it will being to recognize if a student is confused and bored and will able to modify the lesson for the student to regain interest in the lesson. The student will be A able to pass his or hers class and B have fun and be interested while doing it. In paragraph 9 they talk about how it help a theater teacher and his actor ( his students) to be able to udnderstand the theory of emotions. Emotions are always around and may work in your favor from you getting a good grade to putting on a great performance FACS will be able to help to do that.

Venus is really an earth-like planet thats why researchers are interested in it most. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes fimilar features as valleys, mountains, and craters.

83B1E7A4E840,"I think having students participate in extracurricular activities is a great idea. Having students participate in extracurricular activities is very beneficial for your mental and physical health and has many advantages to the students participating.

One reason why being involved in extracurricular activities benefits you is because it's overall good for you. It can build time management which is a really important skill to have as an adult. Another skill you need to have is good social skills, and being around the other people in your activity helps build social skills. When you have good social skills talking to people and being social builds your self esteem and confidence and your mental health is just as important.

Participating in these extracurricular activities is actually really helpful for your future. Colleges love to hear you've done extra things. Even if you dont plan on going to college the extracurricular activities help you shape your life and see what you would like to do. School activities also help you figure out your interests and figure out who you are and who you want to be as an adult.

Speaking of figuring out who you are, being involved in extracurriculars helps build character. You can make friends with the same interests and hobbies. Sometimes, people dont know who they are and doing these extracurricular activities helps a lot because you can find your interests and your personality.

In conclusion, the principle should have all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Its good for your health, its beneficial for your future, and it builds character.

99CAD0AF3560,"Is playing a sport a fun activity for students? Does it help students exercise? Does it help students get healthier? I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons.

To begin with, playing a sport is a good way to be more energetic. Playing a sport can help students exercise. Students might do some warm up games, do some work outs or they can practice at home with their families. Playing a sport can also help students get healthier. Students get more energetic, eat healthy food, and get in good shape. Playing a sport can help students do better things. They could run faster, get stronger, and it can help them do better in class

On the other hand, playing a sport is bad for some students. Students might get sick for being outside. If is winter and students are playing outside all day they might get sick from the cold or if is spring they might get sick from pollution. Some students might get injured. Students might break their arms or legs for playing with others students that are bigger than them. Some students might not be good at sports. Students might suck at soccer, football, or basketball and they won't play.

Even though playing a sport is bad for some students, they can still play. Even though students get sick they can still play. If some students get sick they can get medicine and go back to play. Even though some students might get injured they can recover. Some students might break their legs or arms, they can wait a few weeks and go back to play. Even though some students might not be good at sports they can still learn. Some students might suck at soccer, football. or basketball with practice they can learn how to play.

In conclusion, playing a sport is fun because you play with your friends, run around, or just feel the wind in your face. It helps students exercise by doing some warm up games, work outs, or practice at home with their families. It helps students get healthier by eating healthy food and get in good shape.

869367F8A718,"Imagine not having to wake up earlier in order to shower, eat and put clothes on. Some schools have the convinient choice to let students study from home via online courses or through video. Some Students are fortunate enough to learn from their own home so, they wouldnt go through these minor set backs. Many students wish they were able to learn from home and not having to go to a public or private school. Students could also take courses that are nessesary for them and could help them with things that really are needed for the rest of their lives. For these students learning from home brings many benefits because, students would not worry about getting to school, they would still be able to learn whlile sick, and they would learn at a pace they needed to.

First, the students would'nt worry about how they were going to get to school. Students could relax a lot more knowing that they did not have to make those sacrifices to get to school. Having to make it on time to school adds an emense amount pressure to a student, because they know that their teacher would be angry for being late to their class, but when taking online courses they would be able to learn from home and not worry about making it on time. Being in a public school is all about timing becuase being late could have you getting lectures for hours on end and could get you introuble with your administrator, which is why when you learn from home you could do it any time through out your day because its an online course and its available at all times, when you also learn from home you're able to take your time on certain activities and such other tasks. Depending on the weather that could be even more time consuming, for example if its snowing you would have to warm your vehicle up in order to be able to drive it,and for people who walk to school they suffer the most because they have to either sweat or be so cold on the way to school and on the way back.

Second, students would'nt have to make it to school even when sick. Many schools suggest that students should stay home when sick in order to prevent the sickness from getting every other person in that building sick. When a student takes an online course, they could still learn from home without getting anyone else sick. Missing school could probably be one of the worst things, all because of the amount of work you would have to catch up on. Students that take the online courses are alot luckier because they are still able to learn from bed with any sort of sickness. Some students miss an important day like test days, but when they do they have to wait to take the test and get a zero in the grade book untill they complete the test on what ever make up day is assigned to them. When students who take online cources miss the test day they could complete it when ever, just because it's online and it won't have to be taken on hard copy .

Lastly, the student would be able to learn at he pace that they desire. Students who attend public schools know that they dont always move at the desirable pace because their are many others in there learning with them. For example when a student sits down in math class, the teacher is either really quick or the teacher is really slow. But when online you could have the teacher to please repeat themselves and move at the pace you would really like to. When a teacher has a class of twenty-plus kids she/ he really cant give you undevided attention because there are so many students in that class. For students who take the online classes they could have full attention of the teacher because every student has one specific teacher assigned to just for them, with this they are able to learn a lot more and are able to move from subject to subject alot quicker. The student who take the online class will also move at a much faster rate, because they wouldnt have any sort of distractions, but would give the teacher alot more attention than they would in a public class.

Some schools across the United States offer students the choice to take online courses from home. This helps many students that have problems getting to school and home, it allows students to learn at the pace they will be more successful at, and would help when a student is not feeling well enough to go to school. Many of the students wish they were able to take an online course, which is much better than an online school.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
C73951E1672A,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some people agree, while others don't. Personally, I disagree with this statement. Maybe some students don't want to, they could have jobs after school, or are always busy.

Some students don't want to do extra curricular activities just because they don't want to do it. Maybe they have friends that have home-school and need someone to hang out with. Some students don't want to do extra curricular activities because they just want to go home. Those students do not want to do these activities and just go home. That is my personal reason why I disagree with the principal. People can get stressed out from things like school and just want to go home.

Few, but some students have after school jobs they do to earn money. Some students could be working so they could get a paycheck to maybe pay someone back, or to use it as their lunch money. I work with my Dad sometimes after school, and when I do, I get paid very well. Now if you earned money by, say playing Football, thats a completely different story.

Venus. Since the planet is very identical to earth, we are all going to want to explore it. Exploring and studying Venus comes at a cost though, it is a worthy pursuit despite the presentation of it's dangers.

Venus is a planet in our solar system. It is referred as the ""Evening Star,"" as its one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. It is the second planet from our sun. Many people confuse Venus with being a star, because of its nickname. trying to examine Venus more closely then of the safe vantage point of Earth, can be very challenging despite it being simple to see from the distance.

We are all closer to Mars than Venus sometimes due to the speed changes at which they orbit the Sun by. Us humans send a variety of spacecrafts to the cloud-draped world for it to land on. No spacecraft has survived the landing for a couple hours. This means that all the previous missions to mars were all unmanned. All of these failed missions have explained why Venus hasnt been touched in more than three decades by a single spaceship.

As you can tell Venus is a challenging planet for humans to study because of its reputation. The atmosphere of Venus is very thick as 97 percent Carbon Dioxide covers all of it. The planet's tempatures on the surface average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is greater than what we experience on Earth by 90, all of these conditions are way more extreme than what we experience on Earth.

Many scientist are trying to explore this planet despite its inhospital conditions because it is very identical to Earth. It used to be one of the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Which facsinated many Astronomers. Venus was probably covered by many bodies of water and forms of life could have been supported, just like Earth.

In my state of opinion, we should change the election of voting to the most popular vote for the President of the

I cant just say that and think you will get rid of it, i have to have my reasons of why i think this and share them with you.

First off, when we want citizens to vote, such as my self, we want all of thier votes to count for something.

Not just some little game for you senators to play with. All of our voting need to be included by what we voted in the first place and what we want, thats the whole point of voting. For example, we dont always control whom our electors vote for, that's unfair. Or even worse, we get confused about the electors and sometimes vote for the wrong candidate. Citizens that are voting for a candidate should never be confused on who they vote for. So if i was a State Senator i would stop the Electoral College for good.

There are many reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree. I would state them all but unfortunatly i am running out of time.

Along with this phone evolution cars have had a just as impressive evolution as phone. In 1885 Karl Benz invented the first car. A year later Gottlied invented the engines for the car. Now although both inventions are very impressive, important, and developed well over time shouldn't mean we use them at the same time.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you would have alot of fun and traveling. When you go to places you have never visited before its alot of fun like going to Europe, China, and Greece. You get to cross the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean there you will get to see whales and dolphines swimming in the ocean.

You will have some bumps and bruises along the way but I bet you can fight through it like Luke and Don did. I also bet you will have as much fun as them too and get to know what more places feel like.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
C616CFDBCA6A,"Taking online courses has become increasingly popular among students and professional adults alike. While there are many advantages to taking online courses, there are also some disadvantages that need to be considered. In this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of taking online courses and compare them to a seven-hour education course.

One of the biggest advantages of taking online courses is the flexibility they offer. Unlike traditional classroom-based courses, online courses can be taken from anywhere with an internet connection. This means that students can take courses at their own pace, on their own schedule. For students who have busy lives or work schedules, this flexibility can be a major advantage. Additionally, online courses often offer a wider range of courses than traditional classroom-based courses, which means that students can choose from a variety of subjects and topics.

Another advantage of taking online courses is that they often offer a more interactive and engaging learning experience. Many online courses use multimedia elements such as videos, podcasts, and interactive quizzes to help students learn. This can make the learning experience more engaging and enjoyable, which can lead to better retention of information. Additionally, online courses often offer more opportunities for students to interact with their peers and instructors, which can help them build a sense of community and support.

While there are many advantages to taking online courses, there are also some disadvantages that need to be considered. One of the biggest disadvantages is the lack of face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers. In a traditional classroom-based course, students have the opportunity to interact with their instructors and peers on a regular basis. This can help them build relationships and receive personalized feedback on their work. In an online course, students may have limited opportunities for face-to-face interaction, which can make it more difficult to build these relationships and receive feedback.

Another disadvantage of taking online courses is the potential for distractions. With the flexibility that online courses offer, students may be more likely to procrastinate or get distracted while studying. This can lead to poorer academic performance and a less effective learning experience. Additionally, online courses often require a high level of self-discipline and motivation, which can be challenging for some students.

In comparison to online courses, a seven-hour education course offers a more structured and traditional learning experience. In a seven-hour education",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,7
F28D4ACF03AA," Skateboarding is my favorite talent and skill, and I believe it is a unique sport that requires a lot of time and effort to master. I enjoy skateboarding as a daily activity that takes away all my stress and problems. I skate everywhere, to the store, my friend's house, and even to school. Although I get many injuries, such as scrapes and bruises, I still love skateboarding because it has taught me valuable lessons, such as confidence, resilience, and the ability to learn from my mistakes.

Skateboarding has become a way of life for me, and even though it may not be the safest sport, it is still one of my favorite skills that I am unlikely to get bored of. I remember when I was nine years old, I had many friends who skateboarded, and I was fascinated by this unique sport. I would always observe them practicing and skating everywhere, which encouraged me to try it out. My dad was the one who convinced me to go for it, and I am grateful for his support.

When I went to the skate shop to buy my first skateboard, I was so confused about all the different parts and how they work. The guy working there was very helpful and taught me everything I needed to know about a skateboard, including the deck, grip tape, trucks, wheels, and hardware. After I picked out all the parts, we assembled my skateboard, and I was so excited to try it out.

Since that day, I have been skateboarding every day, and it has become a daily activity for me. I love the feeling of being on my skateboard, and it takes away all my stress and problems.

I feel that it would not be as beneficial to students as the author makes it sound. At some point this technology may be helpful for counselors of schools but it is not for daily classroom use.

I am not saying that this technology is not an innovation. It is a tremendous breakthrough to the world of technology. And it could be beneficial to some professions and aspects of life, like psychology, but it just does not apply to students in the same way. The author says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"".

This is not true.

The only way that this could be true is if we replaced human teachers with computers, and that, i think, is a huge step in the wrong direction.

Technology is helpful to the world but to much of it may be a problem that is irreversable.

Furthermore, I think that this technology could be very helpful to high school counselors. With the emotional reader the counselors will be able to identify cases of depression or anxiety or other mental disorders found in high school easier.

In the article it states, ""we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day"". This is referring to the calculating the computer does. It says that we do that to which is true but we are not nearly as precise or efficient. That is why we need this technology or something like it for counselors, to lighten their burdens, but to also ensure that their job gets done.

Finally, I believe that the installation of emotionally sensing computers to every classroom would be a mistake. However, putting them in the hands of counselors would be brilliant. I think that the world should look into this technology more and decide the best uses for it. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
8FF4F02A7C76,"The Electoral College consists of more cons than pros. The systems that the unprogrammed engineers work on are complicated vast perspectives. When a president gets elected the most voters and does not recieve presidency, wouldn't that confuse you. Popular voting is an effective way to give a candidate presidency simply because the people want that candidate to be the one responsible for the United States. The Electoral College needs to change the way it picks its president. Otherwise, the U.S. would be vulnerable to a president that most people completely denied for the other candidate.

The thing with popular voting is that people can get the president they want. When the elections are based on which candidate has the most popular votes, there are no crazy tricks or a hidden trump card. All you have is a candidate that deserves to be the president of the United States. A good example is Al Gore and his presidency crisis. Most voters looked up to him as president. It was only until the quirks of the electoral college stole his opportunity of becoming president thanks to the system of the electoral college we have today. The situation that makes this crisis even worse is how the voters for the actual electors themselves cannot control whether they win the election or lose. This means that if we keep the routine of the electoral college we have now, there are many opportunities for an unwanted elector. Therefore, leading to an unwanted president.

Ever since 2000, many people have been suffering from economics and industry. This is the simple result of a bad electoral college system. The people of course should have most of the perks in picking a president. If the president is bad at his job in making the U.S. habitable, then the electors are to blame for making a huge mistake. Many doors are opened to sudden changes and confusing decisions. John F. Kennedy could've lost his position since all of the votes didn't necessarily go to him. There's a valid reason why people vote for a candidate. To pick the president they know suits them best.

I will admit to this though. Popular voting is not the accurate way to go through with. I mean there are situations where people just pick a president because he looks proffesional. Others are simply racist and go for the white candidate or even vise-versa. Popular voting is not perfect in the sense of the psychological opinions of the voters themselves. Besides, all of the people living in american soil are different minded. There is literally no way to immediately recognize who the voter is and why his reasons for voting are wrong. There is also nothing we can do since people are allowed to vote for whatever reasons they want.

Due to all of the information given to me about Al Gore and unwanted electors, it is the best solution to change the system to popular voting. Both sides of the arguments have strong reasons to either keep their system or change the way the electoral college is run. Meanwhile, lets be honest. There have been more political downfalls with the system we have now that can be fixed with popular voting. Even though there are people that vote for selfish and unreliable reasons, there is still a balance of the people who want this president and the people who don't. The U.S. is consisted of minds that think completely different in the sense of human nature. We don't live in a utopia where everyone agrees with eachother. Now, being able to let the U.S. decide who they want their president to be, it sounds like a pretty fair way to elect a new president, don't you think?                                            ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Or maybe they have no lunch money and they didn't bring a lunch so they need to call their parents to bring them one. I mean I've had to call my parents before during school to tell them I needed something. One time I forgot to bring my book to school and I left it at home. So I called my mom to bring to school for me and she did. So I got a hundred on bring my book to school that day. Think if something happened like the mom got a flat tire driving to school to pick them up. Then they would need a phone so they're parent could call them and tell them they needed to find a ride home. Think if the principle told them you couldn't have a phone at school. They could be sitting at school waiting for their mom to come get them but it never happens because they don't have a phone and the persons mom couldn't tell the kid she had a flat tire. Making a rule for a kid not to be able to have a phone at school would be outrageous. I also think it's a great plan to let the students be able to use their phones at lunch and dearing passing periods, not like it will effect anyone. Plus

I've seen kids go crazy at school because they forgot to bring it to school it's amazing. If really think taking kids phones away during school is going to help your living in a fantasy world. It's not the phones it are making grades go down it's because they make school no fun, so it's boring and no one wants to even be there. If people really want kids to have better test scores make school have more energy in it. No kid wants to learn in a boring environment. So yes policy one is ten times better then policy two.

I think it's pretty cool how we can just use our phones to talk to people now instead of actually having to see them in person. Like, I can be hanging out with my friends and I'm like, ""Hey, what's up?"" and they're like, ""Not much, just chillin' on my phone."" And then we just keep talking like that for hours. It's like, super convenient.

But, there are some downsides to this too. Like, sometimes I'll be hanging out with my friends and we'll all be on our phones the whole time. And we're not even talking to each other, we're just scrolling through our feeds. It's like, we're not even present in the moment. And sometimes I'll be in class and everyone's on their phones and we're not even paying attention to the teacher. It's like, we're not even learning anything.

And then there's the whole privacy thing. Like, I don't want people to see everything I'm doing on my phone. I don't want them to know what I'm looking at or who I'm talking to. It's like, my business is my business and I don't want anyone else to know about it.

5B9E1E0553AB,"Dear Principal,

I would like to say my opinion about participating in sports or other activities is that you should have to maintain atleast a B in every subject. Before you participate in sports or other activities school always comes first, which is most important to focus more on than joining sports or other activities without doing work. If students know that school work is always their number one priority than they should know that it is most important for them to get good grades. In qualifying sports it should be required to maintain a B in every subject.

I think this because if student who participate in sports get good grades since sports in very important to them then most likely the students would want to atleast do their work and to try their best knowing that they do care for their grade since they are in sports.

Student who also join sports and will maintain atleast a grade of a B in every subject will not really have to worry since they know that they are already doing good with all of their school work. The better grades they get in school shows that they do pay attention in class instead where students don't pay attention or don't do their work and getting a bad grade. The student would need to atleast give up sports and try to do all of his/her work first to get better grade, so that the student can continue to do sports again.

Thank you for all your understanding! I really do appreciate it a lot because students grades are very important to the department of education, parents of the students, and what they are learning in school is always the students number one priority before participating in any other sports or activities.

A3C5DE6588D0,"Hey there! 

So, for this essay, I had to research the positive effects of technology on people's lives, and let me tell you, it's pretty cool stuff. 

First of all, technology makes our daily tasks so much easier. Like, think about it. We can order food, buy stuff, and even hail a ride with just a few taps on our phones. It's like having a personal assistant in our pockets!  And with smart homes, we can control the temperature, lights, and even the music with just our voices. It's like living in a sci-fi movie! 

But it's not just about convenience. Technology can also help people in difficult situations. For example, there are apps that can help people find missing children or locate survival resources during natural disasters. And with video conferencing, people can connect with their loved ones who are far away, even if they can't be there in person. It's like having a virtual hug! 

And let's not forget about students like me! Technology has made learning so much more fun and interactive. We can access a wealth of information and resources online, and even take online classes if we want to. It's like having a personalized learning experience!  And with virtual reality, we can explore different places and historical events without even leaving our classrooms. It's like being a time traveler! 

But here's the thing, some people might say that technology can make us too dependent on it. Like, what if the power goes out or something?  But I think that's a small price to pay for all the convenience and learning opportunities technology provides. And besides, we can always learn new skills and be prepared for emergencies.

CB120B25B46E,"Many students face the challenge of deciding whether to work on their studies alone or in groups. While working in groups certainly has its advantages, such as enabling collaboration, working alone has the potential to be incredibly beneficial as well. This essay will discuss the advantages of students working alone, such as improved time management, better focus, and self-challenging. 

In terms of time management, working alone is a great way to stay on task and use one's time wisely. When working in groups, there is always the potential for one's time to be wasted due to slim productivity from other group members or sidetracking conversations. When working alone, however, students can set their own pace and dedicate their time to their own tasks accordingly without interruption.

With respect to focus, working alone can also help ensure that students are best able to use their attention on their own studies, rather than be distracted by others in the group. Working alone enables students to stay in their own zone and keep distractions and extraneous conversations to a minimum. 

Lastly, working alone presents the opportunity for self-challenging. It can be difficult to hold oneself accountable to do more than what is asked of them, but working alone provides the motivation to go above and beyond. With no one around to rely on, taking the initiative to add to the project is crucial.

C656A870B2B7," The idea of students completing high school in three years and entering college or the workforce one year earlier has become increasingly popular in recent years. Many schools districts offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. However, this program can have negative consequences on students' academic and personal growth.

Firstly, when students are trying to graduate in three years, they may not be able to take elective courses. Elective courses are an essential part of high school education as they allow students to explore their interests and passions. By taking elective courses, students can gain valuable knowledge and skills that they can use in their future careers. However, when students are focused on graduating in three years, they may not have the time to take these courses, which can limit their academic and personal growth.

Secondly, students may not enjoy their final year of high school if they are rushed to graduate. High school is a time for students to explore their interests, make new friends, and prepare for their future. However, if students are pushed to graduate in three years, they may not have the time to fully enjoy their final year of high school. This can lead to feelings of stress and frustration, which can negatively impact their academic and personal well-being.

On the other hand, some people argue that students just need three years in high school to enter college or the workforce one year earlier. They argue that students who graduate in three years are ready to move on to the next stage of their lives. However, this argument is flawed because students need four years in high school to fully develop and prepare for their future. In their fourth year, students can take courses that align with their interests and career goals, and they can also take the time to reflect on their academic and personal progress.

In conclusion, while the idea of students completing high school in three years and entering college or the workforce one year earlier may seem appealing, it can have negative consequences on students' academic and personal growth. Students need four years in high school to take elective courses, enjoy their final year, and fully develop and prepare for their future.

AE8CA585DC1F,"Dear state senator,

There should be a change in the Electoral College. It should be changed to electing presidents by popular vote. It is our right to vote for someone who would actually make changes in our society and make our lives different. The fact that we have to vote electors for those electors to choose our president, it seems unfair. Also, the purpose of voting for president is for everybody to vote not just citizens. Therefore, there should be some changes for voting.

To continue, election of presidents by popular vote should be used in the United States. If we are voting for presidents, then why should us ,citizens, vote for electors in order for them to vote for our president? As stated in source 2 ""The Indefinsible Electoral College"",""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state,candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing""states."" In addition, it states in source 3 ""In defense of the Electoral College"","" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This shows that with the Electoral College, not every region is going to have electoral votes. Therefore, it would not be fair for those regions. Perhaps their votes would not count and basically the chosen president would not pay attention to them.

Furthermore, everyone should be allowed to vote not just citizens. The fact that not everybody are qualified citizens to vote, then the amount of votes would be vague. This process is similar to not having enough electoral votes. The votes would not be popular or in a great amount for that specific place. For example, as it mentions in source 3, ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average..."" There should not be any thoughtful voters deciding on the election. It makes it unfair for those who want to vote but are not allowed.

On the other hand, Electoral College could have benifits. In this process it is easier for the electors who are voting. If there is a tie in votes, then they can pass it on to the House of Representatives in which state delegations take care of the voting. At least with this process, they have their own system set up and if any problems, they know in what way it can be fixed. Unlike voting by popular vote, it can cause some problems because not everyone is allowed to vote and there could be few votes for candidates which would have a negative outcome. However, it would be the same for the Electoral College because there would be not enough electors in regions.

In conclusion, election by popular vote for the president of the United States should be used. It could change society and it will allow us to have a better living. This could give us a chance to vote and feel part of the election. As mentioned in source 2, ""Abolish the electoral college!""    ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
A1BA626DFD42,"Many students tend to forget things they learned at school, in the summer. During summer, teenagers are out having fun and taking a break from school. Although the school year is over, students should not lose focus on what is important. Since teens need to keep focus, a summer project would be the perfect task for them. Summer projects should be designed by their up coming teacher because students will get familiarized with what they will learn, teachers will assign projects that will be beneficial to their students, and teachers will have a criteria showing students what to look for.

To begin with, going into a new school year, no one really knows what the year will be like. Having a summer project allows students to have some knowledge on what the new year might bring. For example, if Generic_School made students do one summer project it would not only help their grade for the first quarter, but also show them know what they will learn. Although there will be students who will not do the projects, there will also be people who will complete them because they are serious and focused on school. Students who work hard and want to be successful in life will see that summer projects given to them will be beneficial to them.

Additionally, teachers know what is best for their students. A prime example here at Generic_School is a geometry teacher, although she assigns a handful of work, she knows that if the students completes it, it will be extremely helpful to them. Most of time students will complain about the amount of work a teacher might give them but in the long run it will help them tremendously. Teachers giving out projects to do in the summer may sound dreadful but it will, undoubtedly help them. To add on teachers will always tell students what to look for and give them a rubric to help them.

As a matter of fact, teachers will never assign a student a project and not give them a rubric. Often times, students will argue and pout about a project, but when a teacher gives their students a rubric and the criteria of the project, it makes it twice as much easier. Students who are serious about school and want to bring up their GPA will not complain about one measly summer project. Also, summer projects will never be too hard, since the school year has not yet started. Teachers will most likely tell their students what to do and how to do it. Even though the projects assigned to students may be easy, some may complain about the subject and want to do a project on a subject they choose.

While some students may prefer to do a summer project on what they want. The pros to this would be that they are actually interested in the subject and more motivated about it. They would also, most likely get a better grade on something they are genuinely concerned about. For example, if a student loved the ocean, they would be more excited doing a project on marine life or how unique the ocean is than doing a project about different rocks. Although this may be true, teacher-designed projects would be more beneficial than a student choosing their own subject.

To conclude, teacher-designed projects would be more productive for students than student-designed projects. It gives students the opportunity to learn a little before the school year starts. Teachers will assign students projects that will be helpful to them. Also, the projects would not be extremely hard because the teacher is essentially telling students how to complete the project. Schools should allow teachers to assign the students projects to do in the summer because it will help them a great deal more than students choosing their own projects.                 ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
8079089BC4D8,"Hey, Mrs. Johnson!  Today, I'm gonna write about that quote by Winston Churchill.  You know, the one where he says success is about not giving up even when things don't go your way.  I gotta say, it's pretty relatable.

I mean, I've definitely experienced my fair share of failures. Like, remember that time I tried out for the soccer team and didn't make it?  Or how about when I bombed that science project and got a C+?  It was tough, but I didn't let it get me down. I kept trying and eventually, I improved. 

That quote by Churchill really speaks to me because it reminds me that failure is a part of life. It's not the end of the world if things don't go as planned. In fact, it's often the opposite. Failure can teach us valuable lessons and help us grow as people.  Like, I learned from my soccer tryouts that I need to work on my shooting skills.  And from that science project, I learned to double-check my calculations. 

But here's the thing, Mrs. Johnson.  That quote doesn't just apply to school or sports. It applies to life in general. Like, when I was trying to make new friends last year, I got rejected a few times.  But I didn't give up. I kept trying, and eventually, I found some awesome friends. 

So, in conclusion, I totally agree with Churchill. Success isn't about never failing; it's about not losing enthusiasm when things don't go your way.  It's about learning from your mistakes and keeping on going.  And trust me, Mrs. Johnson, I'm gonna keep on going. 

Thanks for reading my essay!  I hope you liked it.",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Write an essay exploring whether you agree with Winston Churchill's quote ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"".

E0FAD617D3BF,"The electoral college must go down! The electoral college is unfair to voters across the United States and the amounts of electoral votes doesn't compare to the actual population. The electoral college have messed up the voting system causing horrific crisis in the United States. This system of electoral colleges voting for the president and not actually counting the votes that the people in the United States vote for, which makes it a very outdated system. Using popular vote is more precise and accurate than the electoral college. Popular vote is voted by citizens in which many people not including me should change the electoral system for the popular vote system. Therefore, the electoral college must go down and replaced by a system called the popular vote to determine the president of this great country.

Having electoral voters instead of having the popular vote system is unfair to all. Basically the electoral college process consists of only a selection of the senators. The founding father have established this messed  up system in which it compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress. It is highly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state. This means canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. For example, they only focus on the ""swing states"" like California. Using the winner-take-all system, smaller states don't get the same oppurtunity as bigger states as in the year of the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see any canidates at all including, Rhode Island and South Carolina which holds the largest media markets. Yet these states didn't get to see a single campaign ad in the designated area.

Not only that using this system is unfair to all, but this system of electoral votes don't compare to the population. Meaning the 500,000 voters in a state of Wyoming who wants the other president to win, only have one representative to cast that vote in that whole state of that immense population. While California in the other hand have 55 representatives to cast the votes, in which the represent 35 million voters in that state. Using popular vote, is much more of a precise method or sytem to use. Instead of having one representative from one small state of 500,000 people, the popular votes turned in by qualified citizens will count than just 55 representatives. Imagine having each and everyone's vote count instead of having someone to do it for you. Now that is when people should start voting.

Using the popular vote will indeed avoid many crisis that happened using the electoral system. For example, the election that almost turned into complete disaster in the year of 1960 when Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponent electors, but he made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent"". This couldv'e been easily fixed if the government at this time would take off the electoral system college and instead use a precise system that many people want, named the popular vote. Popular vote is basically when the people have ""the voice"" and speak for themselves and not to another person. Another example would be in the year 2000 when U.S. presidential race, Al Gorereceived more individual votes that George W. Bush nation wide, but Bush wonthe election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. With popular vote, Al Gore wouldv'e won the presidency and the citezens of the United States would've gotten what they wanted instead of having people vote for them. This is why population vote should be in effect as soon as possible.

Using popular vote would be a great and ideal way to decide who is the president during the nationwide election. It should be important to many people as we the people of the United States decide who will take over the countries' responsibility and economy. Yes, the popular votes is a great and ideal way to vote but having electoral colleges will avoid run-off elections. Run-off elections are when no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. However, they can fix this problem by eliminating the electoral votes process. Therefore, it makes it clear that having a popular vote to deide who is the winner would be better when it is election time.

Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winner-take-all basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best. Abolish the electoral system college once and for all!            ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
611BBDDA35CA,"Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed. While some argue that this Facial Action Coding System is a step too far into an innovative future, the advanced program could benefit a multitude of areas.

Thomas Haung's new software would not only find useages in a classroom, but also in daily life. Granting teacher's access to their student's feelings could give teacher's insight on how well their concept's are grasping. To further prove the computer's effectiveness, Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" (D'Alto). In addition to assisting a classroom setting, enabling people to read other's emotions would be benefitial also. Reading into surroundings helps people grow. Knowing what feelings an individual possesses could compell someone to be more considerate or act accordingly to how that individual feels. With that in mind, this program could also strengthen relationships.

Although the Facial Coding Acting System invades privacy, lessons human interaction, and may not be completely accurate of human emotions, it ultimately serves to benefit. While privacy concerns are understandable, the possible results after the slight invasion could be more than worth it. An unfortunate day could be quickly turned around if people were aware of the circumstances. Without a situation being addressed, nothing can be fixed;the same goes for a person's emotional state. However, on the technological aspect, how can one know how reliable a computer is on detecting somebody's facial expression? Dr. Huang addresses this by introducing that the computer first constructs a 3-D model of the face, with all the muscles operating as a human's would. Dr. Huang also explains that ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.

Initially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life. Hopefully, the program will be installed soon so it can start making improvements in various industries across the board.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
6D0DFC557E3B,"With the advancement of technology, students can now break the bounds of the traditional classroom and pursue education in their house while wearing their pajamas. This new opportunity for learning has led schools to question the benefits of an online learning environment. Although one can argue that online classes benefit students with physical disabilities, learning in a virtual classroom ultimately negatively affects the students' educations, for they do not learn soft skills and are more prone to distractions at home.

One can argue that online classes benefit those who have difficulty walking or traveling to school. At Generic_School, there are numerous students who utilize a wheelchair. These students must ride a special bus to travel to and from school everyday. That is an inconvenience for the student as the process of mounting the wheelchair onto the bus is cumbersome and takes a relatively long time. Furthermore, traveling between classes can be embarrassing for the disabled student as operating a wheelchair within the school hallways gathers a significant amount of unwanted attention. However, online classrooms provide a solution for those inconveniences. Virtual learning opportunities make learning more accessible for disabled students as they no longer have to leave the comfort of their home.

However, online classes do not teach students valuable social and soft skill that they could have learned in a live classroom. In school, students not only focus on academics, but they engage in group activities that enhance their teamwork, communication, leadership, and various other soft skills. For instance, live classes at Generic_School often assign students to present a topic in front of a real audience. This practice develops the students' public speaking skills which prepare them for bigger audiences and presentations in their future career. However, an online classroom does not provide that opportunity. Students often work alone; they do not engage in group activities which boost their social skills. Therefore, although students can still develop their academic skills, their social and soft skills will not progress.

Furthermore, students often perform worse when working at home on an online course because there are more available forms of entertainment at home to distract those students. At home, one can watch television, browse the internet on their phone, have snacks, take a nap, or play video games. However, the teachers and administration strictly limit most forms of distraction, in school, to enhance the students' education. Students who participate in online classrooms find themselves a victim of those distractions. However, students at Generic_School and other Generic_City public schools have reported to be more productive in a live classroom environment. Therefore, an online learning environment ultimately inhibits the students' progress and education.

An online learning environment has few benefits such as eliminating the need for the transportation of students who employ wheel chairs; however, online classrooms are inappropriate for students' education as they facilitate numerous distracting activities and do not provide students with the opportunity to develop crucial soft skills such as teamwork and leadership. Nonetheless, technology provides a valuable tool for students to supplement their learning in school. However, it can not replace the age old tradition of going to a physical, social, and engaging classroom.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
714946B2A918,"To begin with, I strongly believe that phone shouldn't be used while driving. The reason I say this, is because using a phone while driving can be a big impact on us today. For an example, phones shouldn't be used because it can cause an accident, Georgia is a hand free state and lastly it's a distraction.

First off, phones shouldn't be used because it can cause an accident. The usage of phones is way too high to be used while driving. Did you know teenagers are having accidents because of these phones? The death rate went up because of using a phone while driving seems to be more important than our lives.

Another reason why phones shouldn't be use is because Georgia is a hand free state. You can end up with a glove department fool of tickets because of this phone problem. Now you have to come out the pocket to pay this ticket when you could have obeyed the law. This play a large roll because you can't stay of your phone to save lives. This play a large roll because the law is trying to save lives.

Last but not least, the phone is a huge distraction to the people who is driving. I say this because I seen it with my own eyes that a phone can distract a person. In the blink of the eye you might end up swerving around a car or probably worse. Also this can be prevented if the diver ignores everything on the outside. I mention this because if the diver does this the death rate might decrease.

In conclusion, driving with a phone can have a large impact on us today. Also driving with a phone is a dangerous game to be play at any age.

llama_70b_v1430,"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" discusses the development of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a technology that enables computers to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions. The technology has been used in various fields such as psychology, advertising, and healthcare. However, the question remains whether using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

On the one hand, FACS can be a useful tool for teachers to assess the emotional state of their students and tailor their teaching methods accordingly. For instance, if a student is observed to be feeling stressed or bored, the teacher can adjust their teaching methods to better engage the student and help them understand the material. Additionally, FACS can help teachers identify students who may be struggling with a particular concept and provide additional support to help them better understand the material.

On the other hand, there are also potential drawbacks to using FACS in the classroom. For example, students may feel uneasy about being monitored and judged by a computer. This could lead to a negative impact on their emotional state and overall performance in the class. Furthermore, FACS may not always be accurate, as facial expressions can be influenced by various factors such as cultural background, lighting conditions, and individual differences in facial features.

Moreover, relying too heavily on technology to assess student emotions may overlook other important factors that can impact their learning experience. For instance, a student may be feeling stressed due to bullying, family issues, or other personal problems that are not necessarily reflected in their facial expressions. In such cases, relying solely on FACS may lead to a misdiagnosis of the student's emotional state.

In conclusion, while the use of FACS in the classroom has the potential to be valuable, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and limitations of the technology. Teachers should use FACS in conjunction with other methods of assessing student emotions and learning experiences. By taking a holistic approach, teachers can create a supportive and engaging learning environment that meets the diverse needs of their students.

In my opinion, using FACS in the classroom is not a good idea. It could make students feel uncomfortable and stressed, and it may not always be accurate. Instead, teachers should focus on building positive relationships with their students and creating a supportive learning environment where students feel comfortable expressing their emotions and concerns. This approach will not only help students learn better but also promote their overall well-being.",1,llama_70b_v1,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

F5D4904B0155,"Many people have experiences that they remember in life. That could be from the first date to a trip to the Bahamas. But little do they cherish their time in school. Schools have gone from being a class taught by a teacher to being at the fingertips on a digital device, but do these devices benefit or hurt the growing generation. Schools have been successful at giving opportunities for all students like collaborative work, hands-on experiences, and the ability to have one-on-one communication between a teacher and the student.

One reason why classroom setting education is beneficial is because of the collaboration among friends. Students tend to enjoy their education much better when they have friends to share it with. The classroom is an environment where students can work on activities together and share their knowledge. It is also good for students to take breaks every once in a while and to communicate with their friends so that they can refresh and get back to learning. Collaboration is something that is generally not found in online classes and causes the student to lose interest in the class. When students have the opportunity of working with peers, it increases their interest and productivity as a result of having a classroom education.

Another benefit to the classrooms is the hands-on experience it includes. Students show more interest in classes that provide selections of activities that go with the topic that is being taught. Schools provide enjoyable experiences that lead to better student development. Students do not enjoy the aspect of repetitive and tiring labor while studying for online courses. Hands-on and entertaining activities add to the excitement of learning in classes.

The final reason that working in classrooms is beneficial is that students can work with their teachers. With online classes, there is a lack in there being people that can help educate an individual person. Classes allow teachers to learn about their students, figure out their weaknesses, and help each one individually. With online courses, students do not often have answers to their questions that they need; sure, maybe they can search the Web, but they do not have somebody that can interpret information so that it can be remembered. In order for students to have improved success, students need one-on-one help from their teachers.

Even though it may be true that online classes can provide more time to study and to learn, classrooms in schools provide a better learning environment over the alternative online classes. Opportunities from schools like collaborative work, classroom activities, and help from teachers provide a better learning environment that bring better success out of students. Online classes may not be providing the correct balance of interest and help that drive success in students. Keeping classrooms like they have been will progress the growing generations to be as successful as past generations because of the great public education that is has been in place. Before applying for online courses, is this the experience you want? ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
