E897534557AF," In recent years, technology has had a profound impact on our daily lives and the world around us. From staying connected with loved ones to ordering food online through an app, technology has made our lives easier and more convenient. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and technology can also have negative consequences if used improperly.

One example of this is the spread of misinformation through the internet. It's easy to find articles and sources that may not be accurate or reliable, which can lead to confusion and even harm. Additionally, technology can also pose a threat to our privacy and security if we are not careful about the websites and apps we use.

Despite these potential drawbacks, I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for achieving great things. For example, technology has revolutionized the way we learn and access information. With the internet, we can easily find resources and information on any topic, making it easier to stay informed and up-to-date on current events.

Furthermore, technology has opened up new opportunities for collaboration and communication, allowing people from all over the world to work together and share ideas. This has led to many great achievements and innovations, and I believe that technology will continue to play a vital role in shaping our future.

In conclusion, while technology has its drawbacks, I believe that its potential benefits far outweigh the risks. With responsible use and proper precautions, technology can be a powerful tool for achieving great things and improving our lives.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

DFBA34FFE11D,"Should students participate in an extracurricular activity? It may seem like a simple question, but there are actually many different answers to this question. Personally, I think that each student can benefit from joining in on an extracurricular. These may include clubs such as Soccer Club or Harry Potter Club, or maybe something like the school newspaper and Student Council. Each of these can provide a positive impact for every person who joins. I think that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they can help kids make and create new friendships, urge someone to develop a new skill, and encourage students to go outside of their comfort zone.

One way an extracurricular activity can benefit a student is by helping them to create new friendships, or maybe become closer with someone they normally wouldn't. For example, I have a friend who is a member of the Nintendo Club at our school. She is the only girl in the club, yet she has made new and unexpected friends through this experience. There are many different types of people who come together for these activities, so when a person joins in they can meet someone who has the same interests and hobbies. Unexpected friendships can be born through the simple action of attending an extracurricular.

A second positive outcome to participating in an extracurricular is the chance to develop a new skill. Another friend of mine loved to draw and write, but wasn't really a fan of sports. Recently, he decided to attend the Basketball Club and ended up loving it! He has continued to go to Basketball Club, and his skills have increased greatly. Although it may take some time, one can eventually develop a new and fun skill which they normally wouldn't have. Additionally, if someone has multiple skills and talents, that can increase their self esteem. A lot of students have insecurities and worry about not fitting in, however, when they gain a new skill this can boost the way they see themselves and increase their confidence.

The last way a student can benefit from participating in an extracurricular is by encouraging them to step outside of their comfort zone. I think that going outside of your comfort zone is something most people are not comfortable with doing, including myself. Over the summer, my brother switched soccer teams and this was very hard for him. Between having to leave his old team behind and adjusting to the new atmosphere, this new change was very difficult for him. As time went on, and he kept pushing himself outside of his comfort zone, and he had acclimated and adapted to the new environment. Now, my brother is so happy that he decided to go beyond what he was used to and loves his team. Even though this situation wasn't about anÂ extracurricular, they are both related. When a student joins a new club, they may be very nervous. But when someone makes the decision to try something new and take that scary step outside of their comfort zone, there will be many rewards in return. One of which is when people try new things, it can lead them to be successful in the future and inspire others to do the same thing.

To conclude, there are multiple benefits for a person who makes the choice to participate in an extracurricular. These include the chance to make new friends and meet new people, help students to develop a new skill, and urge someone to take a risk and go outside of their comfort zone. Although some may not want to try an extracurricular, it can impact them in so many positive ways. Should students participate in an extracurricular? I think yes, and if someone takes a risk and joins in on one, they might just think yes as well.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
af37ecf5,"The electoral college is a symbol of mockery and deprivation of our rights. Voting using this system to elect our leaders is proven null and serves to be removed. Implementing the popular vote in society will not only modernize it but give america its full name for democracy. For many years presidency has debated its ability to be renounced from Electoral college votes or the popular vote. The electoral college is a symbol of our rights as a US citizen being swept under our feet. More formally, this needs to be changed so the people of the U.S can have a greater say in our government, and those who run the country. Granting this power, we will not only modernize but become more democraticPlumerParagraph9.

According to the article "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Not only do citizens agree with changing our system our own appointees do to. Major figures in politics like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole and the U.S Chambe or commerce all agree to the abolishment of electoral college voting privileges. A poll of over 610 voters agree that a direct election should be implemented by the people. This topic can be controversial though. The best argument that reinstates its purpose says "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"". So whats the controversy about we elect them so they elect what we want. The best argument against this is the disaster factor. In the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors by electing electors who oppose John F. KennedyPlumerParagraph1011 There are numerous factors that contribute towards the banishment of the Electoral College. Ranged from the favoritism of big states with big populations hence the higher amount of electoral votes, to the possibility of a tie in electoral votes. The system is unfair and a symbol of non modern democracy. Direct voting offers a chance to citizens of the US the ability to exercise voting and become part of the government in which we follow. If we always lived in this system, improvements must go on as time progresses so we as a nation can improve to become better. Changing our government is just another major step in our progress to becoming the most sucessful nation.

Changing our system so the voters of the US governize america by direct election is a essential change. According to the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" numerous stories have been told that the Electoral college is an act of anachronismPosnerParagraph15. If the people of the US work hard to remove this we can modernize society forever and make US a better democracy. If we fail to do so, we risk taking a major step backwards in time causing another seggregation act. We have been deprived of many of our rights for too long throughout history and now we have the ability to change. The electoral college has been a shaded act of seggregation and need to dperived of its rights and shut down at a notice.",0,train_essays,,5
5EC2696BAD78,"This is why I think the principle should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time because students should be able to have cell phones in school as long as they don't use it in the middle of learning things. Also as long as the ringer is off so that the student does not disturb anyone.

student should be allowed to have their phones in school because teachers hate when the students are loud when their not supposed to be talking, but with cell phones they would be occupied for a longer period of time. Also because most students who have phones already use them during school anyways so I think it would be much easier for you to just let us use them. Teachers hate having to take phones from the students when they have them out and some students may need with them at all times for personal reason. Maybe even for medical reasons. So that's why I think that we should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
llama_70b_v1843,"I strongly believe that meditation and mindfulness practices should be included in schools. These practices have numerous benefits for students, including reducing stress and anxiety, improving focus and concentration, and promoting a sense of calm and well-being.

Firstly, meditation and mindfulness practices have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety in students. In today's fast-paced world, students are often overwhelmed with academic pressures, social media, and other stressors that can affect their mental health. Meditation and mindfulness practices have been proven to help alleviate these stresses, promoting relaxation and calmness. For example, a study conducted by the University of California found that students who participated in a mindfulness program showed a significant reduction in stress and anxiety levels.

Secondly, meditation and mindfulness practices can improve focus and concentration. In today's digital age, students are constantly distracted by their phones, computers, and other electronic devices. Meditation and mindfulness practices help students develop the ability to focus their attention and concentrate on their work. For instance, a study conducted by the University of Washington found that students who meditated regularly showed improved attention and cognitive skills.

Furthermore, meditation and mindfulness practices promote a sense of calm and well-being in students. In addition to reducing stress and improving focus, these practices can also help students develop a greater sense of self-awareness and emotional intelligence. This can lead to better relationships with peers and teachers, as well as improved academic performance. For example, a study conducted by the University of British Columbia found that students who participated in a mindfulness program showed improved emotional regulation and social skills.

In conclusion, the inclusion of meditation and mindfulness practices in schools has numerous benefits for students. These practices have been proven to reduce stress and anxiety, improve focus and concentration, and promote a sense of calm and well-being. As a student in grade 8, I believe that these practices should be incorporated into the school day to help students achieve their full potential and live healthier, happier lives.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Some schools have implemented meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day.

30D7FD691AE3,"As technology develops more, we need to consider what is valueable and what should be left behind. The Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to read students' emotional expressions. Being able to adjust or identify how a student is feeling might prove to be invalueable.

Boredom is a very common feeling in school. It disengages students, stopping them from participating and paying attention all together.

According to the article ÂA classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,Â Dr. Huang predicts. ÂThen it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.Â Technology continues to play a more prominent role in education, this technology could help every student learn and stay interested. Identifying what the student is feeling could make crucial adjustments to the learning plan and the students would be better off for it.

This technology could be valuable for students in a non-academic way. Teachers being able to understand what a student is feeling could be life-saving. People experience problems of different kinds every single day. In paragraph seven the article states, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" A teacher identifying that there is a problem with a student would allow them to talk with that student who might be going through a hard time in there life and provide some relief to a student who might feel burdened or stressed.

This technology would be very valueable in the classroom. Being able to adjust a lesson plan could help students stay engaged and understand the material better.

9124e664,"The Electoral College is a process that has been used for presidential elections since the Founding Fathers established it in the constitution. This system does not necessary give the voters a direct vote, but rather a vote for a slate of electors that vote for them. The voters entrust that their elected slate will vote for their favored presidential candidate. It brings up the argument whether this system of voting should be changed or kept. The Electoral College has some of its good points, but over all, it needs to be changed. Voters need a direct say in their vote, and this system turns off the interest of potential voters.

The voters of the United states should have the ability to directly vote for who they want as President. After all, the people are what make up the country and should have say. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" says Bradford Plumer in The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.

This means that the Electoral College is unfair to the people because the slate they vote for might not even vote for their candidate. Also, in the same article, Plumer states, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This means that there is a chance that the electors could vote for whoever they please.

This system of voting does not give the voters a direct say as to who they want, but also turns off the interest of voters who should be voting for their country. ""Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know that have no chance of winning..."" as said by Plumer. People within those states would have no motivation to vote for their president because their potienial president did not come to their state to convince them to vote. The candidates are only focused on getting majority of the electoral votes, and not who the people really want. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets ddin't get to see a single campaign ad,"" Plumer had stated. These states lack any information about the potential ruler of their country just because the candidates are focused on the states that will help them win.

Although ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for a party's nominee,"" as said by Richard A. Posner in In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , the possibility of having a winner based on electoral vote and not popular vote is very much possible. For instance, the 2000 election, Gore had won popular vote but due to the electoral vote, Bush had won the election. Gore won the vote for the most popular all over the nation, but because the electoral college had a majority of Bush, it was like the nation's actual vote did not matter.

The Electoral College is unfair to the people because they do not get a direct say for who they want, and the candidates only focus on states that will help them win based on electoral vote. The people need a say exactly who they want and should not depend on others to do the vote for them. Canidates should not only appeal to states that would make them win, but also to other states so the whole nation knows exactly who might be ruling over their country.",0,train_essays,,1

E7F9A77683D2,"One way school administrators can attempt to create an environment conducive to learning is by regulating the use of phones during school lunch. On the one hand, having a policy that allows the use of phones during school lunch can create a more relaxed atmosphere and provide students with an opportunity to unwind and connect with friends and family outside of the classroom. Furthermore, allowing phones during lunch can make it easier for students to access educational resources, such as online dictionaries and fact-checking websites. On the other hand, having a policy that does not allow phones during school lunch can help create an environment that is less distracting for both students and staff. This can allow students to focus on their lunch and conversations with their peers, while providing a break from constant phone use. Additionally, not allowing phones during lunch can also reduce the risk of data misuse, as students become less exposed to social media and online services.

I think policy 1 is the better policy 2 because if you allow students bring phones to school lunch will be less noisy and students will always have something to do during free time and less students will get in trouble for sneaking texts or calls since they will have a time to do it.

If you allow cell phones lunch will be less noisy because everybody will be busy texting instead of talking loudly and goofing off. Lunch would be a lot better off if we had cell phones because there wouldn't be a lot of auguring because everybody's texting instead of getting in to dumb arguments.

If you allow cell phones at school students will always have something to do at free time. teachers will never have to send students to there lockers to get something to do they can just pull out there phone and surf the web or text. There will no longer be a student sitting at there desk doing nothing.

Also If you allow cell phones at school there will be less lunch detentions given out for student getting caught texting during appropriate times. There will be very few detentions for students because most detentions are because students text during lunch or home room.

So if you would dear principal please consider policy number 1 over 2.

darragh_claude_v7_708,"While summer is meant as a break from the regular school routine, having some structured learning over the summer can help students maintain important skills and knowledge. When given the choice, I believe summer projects are best when student-designed rather than teacher-designed.

When students have autonomy in choosing their own summer project topics, they are more motivated to engage in meaningful learning. By allowing students to pick subjects they find genuinely interesting or relevant to their lives, they will be internally driven to explore the topic in depth. This type of intrinsic motivation leads to better focus and quality of work compared to assignments chosen by teachers without student input. 

Giving students ownership over project topics also fosters independence and skill development. By guiding their own work, students learn valuable skills like time management, decision making, and self-directed learning - skills that will serve them well in higher education and careers. Trying to complete a task completely of their own design also builds confidence facing open-ended challenges.

Of course, some guidance is still useful to ensure projects have educational merit. Teachers could provide general parameters like the type of final work (essay, presentation, etc.) or subject area but leave the specific focus up to students. This balance of student choice within guidelines maximizes engagement while maintaining academic standards.

In conclusion, when the goal is to sustain learning over summer break, student-designed projects are ideal. By letting students follow their interests with some guidance, they are intrinsically driven to dive deeply into self-directed work - an approach that serves their development far better than topics assigned externally. Autonomy, motivation and skill-building will better prepare students for future challenges compared to rigid, teacher-driven assignments over break.",1,darragh_claude_v7,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

c7c346532e79_04112023,"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could have both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, this technology may help teachers understand how their lessons are engaging students on an emotional level. If a teacher notices many students appear bored or confused during a lesson, FACS could provide valuable feedback to improve instruction methods. It could also assist teachers in identifying students who are struggling emotionally but may not express it otherwise. This type of technology could help teachers provide better emotional support to students. 

However, constant monitoring of students' facial expressions with FACS also raises privacy and behavioral issues. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their emotional reactions are being surveilled and analyzed in real time. This could increase anxiety and discourage natural emotional responses during class. Students should feel free to focus internally on learning without worrying about expressions being screened. Additionally, identifying emotions through facial expressions alone may not provide full context and could result in misinterpretations. A student's expression may not accurately reflect how they internally feel about a lesson.

Overall, while FACS technology aims to give teachers useful insights, its continuous use in the classroom to monitor students risks invading privacy and altering natural classroom behaviors. Teachers could benefit from occasional voluntary emotional check-ins with students, but constant facial monitoring goes too far. More traditional methods of teacher-student communication are generally preferable to validate a student's emotional experience in school. If used sparingly and with consent, this technology may offer value, but broader application could do more harm than good.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,7

I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her want's to take. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes.

First of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked the'll get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Which in fact they are wrong student shouldnt have to take the art classes to begin with.

In my true opinion student should have the chance to express his or her true feelings, and reach a main goal in life.

Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it. Again arts should not be a requirement for students it is unethical, and unheard of as far as i know.

What use will it be to us students in the real world? No use at all, unless a student wants to fallow a career path in art.

9F79DB6DE57E,"Seeking multiple options could show someone a variety of things they could do. Instead of only seeing something one way, someone could be able to use many peoples opinions to form their own. People around us look at the choices we make and form opinions about us through those decisions. If we go around doing the first thing that comes to mind, people will see that, and think of us as irresponsible people.

The option that is available to someone at first may not always be the best, and it is good to take a step back to survey what multiple people say before you pursue a decision. A good analogy for this idea is someone surveying an island that they have just come across. They would need to get to a vantage point, then make a decision after seeing what they are dealing with on this new land that is unfamiliar to them. Any person who doesn't take a second to survey what they have to do is going to make a bad decision sooner or later in their life, so it is good to do so if a person wants to be successful.

Somebody giving you advice on something may not actually like you, and they might be trying to manipulate you. Fake friends could tell you to go somewhere with them because it will be fun, even if they know it's dangerous or not in your best interest. If you seek more advice from other individuals that may be looking out for your best interest then you will be able to make decisions easier. Seeking multiple people's opinions may help give you a better reputation, while keeping you safer because the decisions you make will most likely be influenced by at least one person looking out for you.

Not only is seeking advice from multiple people a good practice, but getting multiple peoples opinions on something or someone is also very helpful so that you do not judge someone or something off of one person's opinion on them. Someones opinion on something may come from a past experience with the subject, and that opinion may help you in understanding what kind of person somebody is. Or somebody could be feeding you lies about someone or something because of some sort of bias because of race, religion or anything like that.

In conclusion if you seek understanding by getting multiple peoples advice then youÂ will be more likely to form a better decision and have better opinions about things all around you. Some people's advice is meant to hurt you and some peoples advice is biased. Getting multiple perspectives is always good because it helps you grasp the bigger picture.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,8

Responsibility and hard work are two important qualities that employers look for in potential employees. A responsible and hardworking individual can take on any task and finish it efficiently, without the need for constant supervision. These qualities are highly valued in the workplace because they enable employees to work independently and effectively, which is essential in today's fast-paced business environment.

Employers who have experience in hard work understand the value of these qualities. They appreciate the dedication and commitment that a responsible and hardworking employee brings to the job. They also recognize that these qualities are not limited to specific jobs but are applicable to all types of work.

Responsibility and hard work are not only essential in the workplace but are also important in everyday life. In many countries, people are expected to work hard and take responsibility for their actions. This is especially true in times of crisis, such as during the current pandemic, where individuals are required to modify their lifestyles and take on additional responsibilities.

One of the benefits of having responsibility and hard work is that it allows individuals to achieve their goals and aspirations. For example, if you are passionate about your job, you can put in the effort to improve your skills and knowledge, which can lead to career advancement and personal growth.

In conclusion, responsibility and hard work are essential qualities that are highly valued in the workplace and in everyday life. These qualities enable individuals to work effectively, achieve their goals, and contribute positively to society. Therefore, it is important to cultivate these qualities in oneself and to seek out individuals who possess them when looking for potential employees.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

2D624D740570,"I think that limiting car usage is great for the environment. There are a lot of benifits that come from it. If we use car less then greenhouse gas emissons will decrease and thus cleaning the air of smog. Some of the benefits that limiting car use is that: 1. it decreases poisonous smog, 2. lots of cities in the world are doing it, 3. and last but not least it could promote other ways of travel. Its about time that the world start changing some harmful habits.

To start of, Reducing car use is very effective when trying to get rid of smog. In some cities such as Paris, smog is a big pollution there. In Paris they even went head to head with Beijing,China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of this globally known city. by enforcing this, some days cars with even numbered license plate could drive. The next day odd numbered cars could drive. If you were caught then you were fined. so by paris doing this congestion was down a whopping 60% in Paris after just 5 days.

This would cut down greenhouse effects tremendously. So far reducing car use sounds pretty good.

Furthermore Paris isnt the only place in the world to do this. Bogota,Colombia in a program that's set to spread to other countries, miliions of Colombians either hiked, bike, skated, or took a bus to commute around the countriy to their destination. This is known as a car free day. This car-free day left the streets of the capitol void and empty of rush hour traffic. Even the U.S. goverment is considering the international event that is also helping the environment at the same time.

Another thing to reduce greenhouse gas is if people would find a more alternative way of transportation. City buses could count as an alternative,because think if a bus could seat 30 people. Think if all 30 people had their own car, then the emisson amout would substantialy increase 30 vehicles rather than 1 vehicle . Other ways of transpotation are things such as bikes, skates/skateboard, or just walking. none of those alternatives release any type of emissions.

In a way not using cars sounds great in many ways,but there are those people out there that rely on the usage of cars to transport themselves such as anyone with physical handicaps. Maybe this is the start of something new but what happens to this earth is all on us so it what we dicide to do with it rather we wont it to last or we can just let it go and lose the one planet we have left.Â        Â Â Â Â Â Â Â        Â Â Â Â Â Â Â     ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
6A977849DE08," When it comes to seeking advice or assistance, it's always a good idea to consult with more than one person. This is because different perspectives and experiences can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of a situation and provide valuable insights that might not have been considered otherwise.

One of the main benefits of seeking advice from multiple sources is that it can help to validate or challenge your own ideas and assumptions. When multiple people provide the same piece of advice, it's more likely that it's correct and based on sound reasoning. On the other hand, if you receive conflicting advice, it's important to consider the motivations and biases of each source and try to determine which one is most credible and relevant to your situation.

Another advantage of seeking advice from multiple sources is that it can help to broaden your understanding of a topic or issue. For example, if you're working on a project or writing an essay, seeking advice from experts in different fields can help you to develop a more nuanced and informed perspective on the topic. This can help you to identify potential gaps in your knowledge and develop a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

In addition to providing valuable insights and broadening your understanding, seeking advice from multiple sources can also help you to build a network of contacts and resources. This can be particularly helpful if you're looking for job opportunities or need assistance with a specific project or task. By building relationships with people who have expertise in your area of interest, you can gain access to valuable resources and opportunities that might not have been available otherwise.

Overall, seeking advice from multiple sources can be a valuable tool for personal and professional growth.

C3AE86A7A222,"There is way to forget all of the school work and do something a lot more funnier during the day its called doing an extracurricular. For example, you had a very boring day in all of your class's ,and having that extracurricular like a sport could set you in a different mood. I strongly agree having an extracurricular is a good idea for the students. It's a good use of free time away from the school work, future careers ,and it would be fun for the students.

An extracurricular is a great way to get away from school stress. There are some days students have to do nothing but sit down and write for the whole day. Research says that doing this same cycle everyday will not help students intake information the right way. Having this extracurricular is also a lot like having your brain rest to better process that information.

A extracurricular would be great for students looking for more experience for future careers. like joining the student council or doing a sport. For example joining the students council isÂ like taking ownership of a job ,and doing a sport like football, soccer and wrestling start to get young athletes to get a lot better. An extracurricular can be very helpful in the long run.

Having a extracurricular would be a lotÂ of fun for students picking what they wanna do. Like some students that have a heart for sports or if other students want more of a challenge joining the student council may be fun for them. Research says that when your're a lotÂ more happy you are more awake and ready to learn. If all the students did an extra curricular it would for a fact brighten their moods.

In conclusion, having a extracurricular is a good idea for the students. It's fun and it would get more students to wanna do it. Its a good use for free time and to take a break from school work. Helps out a lotÂ of students for the real world.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
6BDFC792D2D4,"Research shows that students work better at home compared to going to school five days out of the week. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home ratherÂ than at school because It relives them from large amounts of stress, its allows them to to focus and learn more efficiently, and it gives them plenty of one on one timeÂ with their teacher.

To start off, attending classes at home will relive students of stress. Many students go to school with bullies and many unkind people, the aftermath of this it that many students suffer from stress and anxiety. Stress and anxietyÂ are not good for human beings physically, mentally, and emotionally. Therefore we should take it very seriously especially for the students trying there hardest to receive a good education. For instance there are multiple bullies in school that enjoy picking with others, this causes students to be fearful of going to class. Being bullied is a big burden to bare. This will cause many students to not willingly attend school in fear of being bullied. Also school can be very hard and challenging. While your at home their is a higher possibility of being more relaxed and calm, rather than at school it can be very hectic and judging. Home is somewhere and you can relax in a quiet peaceful area while you are doing your schoolwork. Taking classes at home will allow students to stay away from all the hate and negativity.

Furthermore, attending classes at home will allow students to be able to focus and concentrate more efficiently. Many students complain of their classmates being goofy or disruptive, students in the hall making noises and being to loud, and even fights and arguments within the class rooms are a major interruption. If students had classes at home it would be so much easier for them to focus in a calm and quiet area. For an example, Many teachers say that multiple people in there classes find it hard to focus due to class clowns, students acting out, hallway disruptions, and being distracted by doing things that were not instructed by the teachers. Also many students found it very challenging to focus on what they needed to when all they heard was ruckus. A result of not being able to pay attention, many students tend to fail or not make the grades needed to pass the class or even the grade. Many parents would consider having their children attend their classes at home so there children can be successful. In order of passing your will have to be able to pay attention which is very hard in a class full of students.

Lastly, it allows students to have more one on one time with there teachers. In a class full of students, it can be very hard trying to assist every students with all there wants and needs. Also there are many students that are confused on what they are learningÂ because the lack of help and attention they are receiving. For example, a students once said at one point she was clueless on what she was doing. This was because the teacher was never able to get with her and work through the problems due to the teacher trying to satisfy everyone elseÂ needs. This is a problem because every now and then students need individual help and it is hard to receive that help when others need it as well. This can all be resolved by letting students attend classes at home. This will allow students to receive the one on one help they need with their teacher. The teacher will be able to walk through with the student step by step and teach them the way needed.

In conclusion, Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home ratherÂ than at school because It relives them from large amounts of stress, its allows them to to focus and learn more efficiently, and it gives them plenty of one on one timeÂ with their teacher. Attending classes at home will benifit studnets in many ways.Â    Â  Â  Â  Â    Â  Â  Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
llama_70b_v1713,"Introduction:

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" thinks that studying Venus is a good idea even though it's really dangerous. In this essay, I will say why I agree with the author and why I think they do a good job of proving their point.

Body:

First, the author says that Venus is like Earth in some ways, like how they're both rocky planets with atmospheres. This means that studying Venus can help us learn more about Earth and how it works. For example, the author says that Venus's thick atmosphere could help us understand how Earth's atmosphere works and how it affects the weather. This is a good reason to study Venus even though it's dangerous because it can help us learn more about our own planet.

Second, the author says that studying Venus can help us learn more about the universe in general. Venus is different from Earth in a lot of ways, like how it's way hotter and has a really thick atmosphere. Studying these differences can help us understand how other planets in the universe might be different from Earth too. This can help us learn more about the universe and how it works.

Finally, the author says that studying Venus can help us find new ways to live on other planets. Venus is a lot like Earth, but it's also really different. If we can figure out how to live on Venus, we might be able to figure out how to live on other planets that are similar to Earth. This could be really important in the future if Earth gets too crowded or if we need to find a new home.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does a good job of proving that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it's dangerous. They give lots of reasons why studying Venus can help us learn more about Earth, the universe, and even how to live on other planets. I think that studying Venus is a good idea too, and I hope that scientists can figure out how to do it safely so that we can learn more about this really interesting planet.",1,llama_70b_v1,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinchi studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convery specific emotions. His new computer software stores smilar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da Vinci Code""! The Mona lisa demonstation is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. The muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around my eyes. The muscles will not make lie, so Mona Lisa have wonder parts of human.

907B493FEF99,"It is alarming to think that less than twenty years ago virtual technology was just being invented, and ever since the turn of the 21st century the world has started to use technology and virtual data more and more. The world has started to trend in a direction in which humans rely on technology. For example, tools like phones and cars are used everyday. Virtual technology can be helpful however, and it is currently expanding to provide humans with new ways to make life easier. One way technology is being introduced to benefit humans is through distance learning or online classes. This new form of learning allows students to attend school from the comfort of their own homes. Distance learning gives students a more customized and adaptive learning experience while giving students more time to engage in the extracurricularsÂ they love.

One way distance learning is beneficial for students is because it allows students to customize their classes.Â For example, Students in the public education system can only enroll in courses that are offered at their school. This may restrict students from taking classes that they are interested in or limit students from branching out and potentially finding a new passion. However, students taking online classes can choose from a wide variety of classes, that most likely incorporate their interests. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning is beneficial for students. Not only do student have the freedom to choose what to learn, they also have the freedom to choose when to learn. Having the freedom of choosing when to learn is vital for students with specific needs or disabilities. When students are unable to go to school, learning can continue. This eliminates sick days, weather delays or cancellations, and school holidays. Furthermore, students are able to take courses at their own speed. Rather than the typical every otherÂ day school schedule, students can master a course in less than a month. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning and when a student can learn is beneficial for all students.

Another benefit to learning from home is that it gives students more time to focus on their needs and wants rather than the schools. In certain cases when student prodigies are more focused on a sport, a musical instrument or a job, learning from home can grant students more time to perfect their craft. Online learning allows them to have their primary focus being on what they love rather than on a rigorous and time wasting traditional school day. Another example is in the case of a student that does not thrive in a the social aspect of school. Sometimes kids feel overwhelmed and threatened by the large amount of students in one school. In order to feel comfortable, kids could video conference into school and learn from the comfort of their own home. School can be long and sometimes overwhelming so in certain cases distance learning can be beneficial.

Learning is essential to grow as an individual but also as a population and with new technology, accomadating for certain needs is easy and beneficial. Distance learning is a way for students to customize when and what they want to learn as well as feel comfortable and adapt to their needs. Distance learning is a thing of the future that will soon benefit many.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
C63D6ACACEE3,"Driverless cars should be allowed when they are safe, and when they are complete. You still should let people drive regular cars though because doing this is taking away people's freedom to drive if the cars become fully driverless. Just think about all the teenagers who won't get to expeirience driver's ed and getting their license and how exciting it is.

Also if there is a technical problem with the driverless cars it could be a hazzard. If they are going to make them driverless they should at least make where the person can manually control it incase of failing technology. The car also since it isn't a human it doesn't have the reaction time that our brains allow us to have. It also doesn't have judgement and any skills to fix itself if the car breaks down.

It would also make people mad because they have a right to drive and some won't like it if you take that away from them. Also some people are control freaks and always would like to be in control of their vehicle. You also couldn't own your own car as the story says because it will be more of an automative cab system instead of your own propery. So no more making your vehicle the way you wan't it, it would also take away people's hobbies of fixing up cars.

The other thing is that it would cost people and the government more to keep the cars up and running with all the technology and also how many cars there will be to satisfy people. Also what would we do with all the old cars? Would we just junk all of the old cars? The smart cars would also have to be able to adapt to ever road condition as well if they are driverless and it would be hard to program all different cars for different conditions. It would also cost a lot to fund this in the first place and to get people to warm up to the idea.

I think that if we do the driverless cars then it should also be affordable for people to use. I also don't think that technology could mimic a human's actions when they drive because a human body is way more advanced than technology is. If something happend to the car while you were in it what would you do? would you have to call someone, because the normal person couldn't fix the tech inside of a driverless car to get it back up and running. People in the story even said that we would need smart roads as well to make this work. They also said what would happen in an accident and if it would be the fault of the person in the car or the car manufacturer. Also they would need to make countless new laws to even make this car legal and able to drive on the roads because as of now the cars are only legal in three states and the capital.

F123CF0BF9DB,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that making your own decisions and creating your own rules is essential for personal growth and development. While it may seem easier to simply follow the decisions and rules of others, taking control of your own life can lead to greater independence, self-awareness, and fulfillment.

Firstly, making your own decisions allows you to take responsibility for your own life. When you make choices based on your own values and beliefs, you are accountable for the outcomes of those decisions. This can be scary, but it also allows you to learn from your mistakes and grow as a person. By taking ownership of your choices, you can develop a sense of self-reliance and resilience that will serve you well throughout your life.

Secondly, creating your own rules can help you develop a strong sense of self-awareness. When you follow the rules and decisions of others, you may not fully understand why those rules exist or how they apply to your life. However, when you create your own rules, you are forced to think deeply about what is important to you and how those values should guide your actions. This can lead to a greater understanding of your own beliefs and values, which can be invaluable in navigating life's challenges.

Finally, making your own decisions and creating your own rules can lead to greater fulfillment and happiness. When you are in control of your own life, you can pursue your passions and interests without feeling like you are constrained by the decisions of others. You can also develop a sense of purpose and meaning in your life, as you are able to make choices that align with your values and beliefs. This can lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and happiness, both in the short and long term.

In conclusion, making your own decisions and creating your own rules is essential for personal growth and development. By taking control of your own life, you can develop a sense of self-reliance and resilience, gain a greater understanding of your own beliefs and values, and lead a more fulfilling and happy life.

The advancements in technology have brought about many positive and negative changes in various aspects of our lives, including relationships, buying items online, and spending time with family.

On the positive side, technology has allowed people to connect with others from different parts of the world, making it easier for them to maintain relationships. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have made it possible for people to keep in touch with friends and family who live far away. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to buy items online, saving them time and effort. Online shopping has become more convenient, and people can purchase items from the comfort of their homes.

However, technology has also brought about some negative effects on people's lives. For instance, technology has made it easier for people to become isolated and disconnected from others. People often spend more time on their devices than interacting with others, leading to a decline in face-to-face communication skills. Furthermore, technology has made it easier for people to buy items online, leading to a decline in local businesses and a loss of jobs.

Technology has also impacted how people spend time with their families. While technology has made it possible for families to stay connected even when they are apart, it has also made it easier for people to become distracted and spend less time with their families. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to work from home, leading to a decline in the quality of family time.

Furthermore, technology has allowed people to complete tasks without contact with others, leading to a decline in interpersonal skills. People often rely on technology to complete tasks such as ordering food, booking appointments, and paying bills, reducing the need for human interaction.

How much money would all this technology cost? Will people be able to afford these cars? I think it's a good idea to have sensors, cameras, and alarms or vibrartions to alert the driver so there can be less accidents. I'm going to be discussing why I don't agree with drivless cars, what would happen if we got driveless cars, and what improvements could be on the cars.

I don't feel safe with driveless cars because when it comes technology anything can go wrong. It could malfunction and if it happens while your're on the road, you could be endangering yourself and those around you. To other people it made sound nice to relax while your car drives you, but I would feel safer if it was just me driving the car myself. I feel like the only reason people are coming up with driveless cars is because of how many accidents we get per year. Mostly because of people drinnking and driving or people texting and driving. If people would just focus on the road and not speed, we would not have so many accidents. That's the reason why I don't agree with driveless cars.

I think that we would probably have a lot of accidents if we have driveless cars. There has been times when technology just randomly malfunctions which can sometimes involve death. While your on the road something can wrong and you might not be able to do anything because you have no control over the car. We also got to think about how much all this technology would cost and would people be able to afford these cars. People might enjoy driving themselves and may not want a car driving them. People could get bored depending on their destination. There's not really much to say but that its's dangerous to use drivelss cars. If we were to use driveless cars, it would take a lot of testing and time to make sure its safe, but for now we can't really trust it until it has been properly tested.

I think it's a good idea to have a lot of technology on the car to make sure the roads are safe and we have less or no accidents. The idea of having sensors, alarms, and cameras because that can help us a lot to prevent accidents. If you're about to crash into a car it will have ana alarm to let you know you're about to hit a carpr have automatic brakes. The cameras can help you to see whose around you. This can help you when your making a turn or when you switch lanes. I agree with having improved cars but i don't agree on having driveless cars. Those are the improvements that the cars should have to help us to stay safe and drive better.

A great example of this idea is the story of Brad, an ambitious young professional who was looking to make a career change. Although his family had been advising him to stay in his current field, his heart was telling him to take a chance. Despite the risks, Brad followed his intuition and made the move; he soon found himself quickly climbing the career ladder and achieving more than he had ever dreamed of.

The importance of tuning out the âvoice of reasonâ and instead following our hearts cannot be understated.

By using Facial Action Coding Systems it would help students become more engaged in class. In the article by Nick D'Alto he states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". By using this new technology it would provide an effective learning way for each individual student. The computer would be able to reconize how each student is feeling then would modify to what helps each indiviual get engaged and learn. This technology would help students get better grades and it would customize to exaclty what helps them get engaged.

This new technology would also help you reconize exactly how each person is feeling. Many people are stuggling through depression or even worse things and they are so afraid to open up. Some people just don't know how to open up to anyone and this technology would help express what each person is feeling. In this article it state, ""Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conves happy, worried, etc"" (Nick D' Alto). Eventhough we might think we know how someone feels we never truly know what is going on. This technology could help bring in end to the depression that some students are going through alone.

This technology could also open up ways to reconize if people are lying. Nick D'Alto states, ""Faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"". Being able to reconize how politicians or celebrities are feeling would help open up many truths to the world. For example if a student was to be lying you would be able to tell which could help out a lot in the classroom. Students might find it easy to lie which ends up getting the innocent introuble. This technology would bring an end to that.

The new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables us to identify humans emotions. This new technology would bring many different benefits to the world like helping people with their emotions, being able to reconize if people are lying, and it would help students become more engaged in their learning. Facial Action Coding System is a wonderful idea that should be brought into this world to help us get answers and help those who are going through a lot alone. ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
3C30F580ABAE,"France, Germany , United States, Colombia and other countries are taking actions of the problems that the cars are making. It is true that cars are helpful and make the life easier to some persons but lately the concer of how this machines affect the ecosystem have being increasing. That isÂ  why countries have come with different projects to try to limit the amount of cars they are around their cities. If we see from a different perpestictive the limiting of cars can be a good thing and produce result that are favorable to everyone.

Through the years they have been several projects of reductiond of car circulation and it is visible that the population have apadted to the type of living that cities have imposed.

One example of this is Vauban, Germany were 70 percent of the families do not have a car and 57 percent sold a car to move there. with that example we can see that people can get used to a live where cars are not necesary to have. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I am uch happier this way,"" these are the word of one of the resident of that city that get used to a lifestyle without a car. In that city people get used to walk which is more healty and do not produce any harm to the ecosystem.

Other cities like Paris have made laws to control the amount of pollution cars produce since , this capital have more smog than other European capitals making this a awful fact. With the actions they have made of baning even-numbered license plate on Mondays they have reduced the amount of smog which is good. Another example is what is happening in Bogota, Colombia where you can see car-free days, where people any other mean of transportations except for personal cars. When the actions of both cities atre taken it is visible the cahnge on the enviroment. This great ideas help the crouded cities to reduce their levels of pollition and icentive people on use the car less.

United State that is a country that produces a lot of pollution have seen good changes in the tendenci of the people of using car. Studies have prove that the amount of new cars buied have decrease in the last years. Also there have been a drop of the amount of people getting a license. This show that is a county support public transportation and make programs that will make people use less the cars they will have a positive result.

Walking and using a bike is good for the personal healt. The less using of the cars help the fight against pollution and avoid the rise of temperature in the earth. Obesiti and pollution are a big problen in the last decades but they both share something in common, they can be fought by using less a car and walking, being this the perfect statement that prove why limiting the car usage will be an adventage.

CBCA3CFF320B,"As an 8th grader, I think distance learning classes can have a pretty big impact on how important school is to us. For one thing, since we don't have to physically go to school, we can do our work whenever and wherever we want. This can be pretty cool, especially if we have a lot of other stuff to do at home, like sports or clubs or hanging out with friends. But it can also be kind of easy to take advantage of, like if we just want to skip a class and do something more fun instead.

Like, I know some people who will just not do their work for a distance learning class because they don't have to be in a classroom and they don't have a teacher telling them what to do. They might just play video games or watch TV instead. And some people might even pretend to do their work, but they're really just messing around on their phone or something. It's like, why bother if you don't have to be there in person?

But even though it's easy to take advantage of, I think distance learning classes can also be kind of bad for our motivation and expectations. When we don't have to be in a classroom and see our friends and teachers every day, it can feel like school isn't as important. Like, why bother putting in effort if we don't have to be there? And if we're not putting in effort, then we're not going to learn as much and we're not going to do as well in school.

And another thing is that without structure and supervision, some people might get into trouble or do things they're not supposed to do. Like, if there's no teacher there to make sure we're paying attention and following the rules, then some people might get distracted or start messing around. And that can be bad for our behavior and our grades.

But even though there are some downsides to distance learning classes, I think there are also some pros. For one thing, we can do our work whenever we want, so we can take breaks and do other things when we need to. And we can also learn at our own pace, so if we need more time to understand something, we can take it. And it's also really convenient, because we",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

2C0023E82D72,"For years, students have gone to school in a typical classroom setting; however, an increase in technology has led to a rise in the amount of students opting to take online classes. The argument is whether these online classes are as beneficial to a student as a traditional classroom setting would be. I argue that online school is not as benefical to a student; instead, online classes can wind up being detramental to a students development and education. Online school is less beneficial to students education because there are more distractions at home than in a controlled classroom setting, students do not have as much human interaction, hindering character development, and students have limited resources which limits students knowledge and understanding of particualar topics.

Although some may argue that traditional classrooms are filled with distractions, home settings have even more distractions. Classrooms are controlled settings where students are assigned specific tasks for a particular amount of time. Teachers and administrators also try to limit distractions for students by placing strict learning policies, such as, no phones during instruction. In my IB Business Management class, my teacher, Generic_Name, disgussed the advantages and the disadvantages of working from home. One major disadvantage of working from home was the increased level of distrations, which led to an ultimate decrease in productivity amongst workers. If adults are not able to implement online working from home efficiently and effectively, how can students? Students need the rigid structure that a classroom provides. The classroom setting helps aid in developing proper work ethics that students can use in their future careers. In sum, online school could lead to a decrease in student productivity rates, which further emphasizes why online education is not beneficial to students.

Human interation is vital to student character development. Although some may argue that students could increase their level of human interaction through increasing their extra ciricular activities, collaborating with other students on an acidemic level is far more beneficial to students. Online schooling does not allow for students to think critically with one another. Instead, online schooling focuses on the thoughts of the student that is taking the class. This type of schooling could be detrimental to young students who grow up with this form of education. Online schooling does not allow for students to see other peoples viewpoints, it instead, teaches students that only their opinion matters; a mindset that is difficult to revert. Being singleminded in a workplace could make a person difficult to work with. Thus, decreasing the chances of maintaining a healthy job environment and relationship with co-workers. Furthermore, in a classroom setting, students interact with one another daily, teaching students the importance of communication while also building character.

Some like to argue that online school gives students more freedom to explore new topics, however, online school does not give students the same hands-on-experience that the students in the classroom may recieve. For example, if a student were to be taking an IB Chemistry course online, the student might only do simulation labs online instead of physically munipulating the chemicals in lab. Although simulations are a sufficient way to gain knowledge on a particular topic, hands-on training and experimentation, in the classroom, are far more effective ways for students to gain knowlegde and understanding of how different elements function. With online students not having the same resources that students in the classroom have access to, this puts the online learners at a disadvantage, which only furthers my argument that online school is less beneficial to students.

Eventhough online school has a few advantages, ultimatelty the disadvantages including: increased distractions, little character development, and limited growth in knowledge becasue of lack of resources, out weighs the positives. Traditional classroom style teaching allows students to learn and grow both acidemically and also in their character development, whereas online school hinders acidemic and character growth within students. These traits are part of the foundation that makes a person, so with online schoool limiting those traits, it cannot be as beneficial as traditional classroom teaching is.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
35e1a5d0b917_04112023,"Driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation, but also pose serious risks that require careful consideration. While autonomous vehicles could reduce accidents and congestion, ensuring public safety should be the top priority as this new technology is developed.

One benefit mentioned in the article is that driverless cars could significantly decrease accidents caused by human error. Without distracted or impaired humans behind the wheel, autonomous vehicles may drive more cautiously and avoid collisions. This safety aspect seems promising. However, the technology is still in early stages and not proven on a mass scale. Software or mechanical glitches could potentially cause accidents that autonomous systems may not be able to prevent or cope with as well as an alert human. Before driverless cars are allowed independently on public roads, extensive testing and regulations must demonstrate they can drive as securely as human drivers in all conditions. 

In addition to safety concerns, privacy issues could arise from the sensors and data collection used in autonomous vehicles. The article notes cars may record and transmit people's movements, conversations, and other personal information without consent. This type of constant surveillance poses risks if data are not adequately protected or used responsibly. Strict privacy laws and oversight would be needed to address such concerns and maintain public trust in the technology.

While driverless cars show potential to transform travel, ensuring public safety should be the top priority as development continues. More research is prudent before allowing autonomous vehicles on roads without human drivers ready to take control if needed. With adequate testing, regulations, and privacy protections put in place, driverless cars may eventually ease congestion and reduce road deaths. However, until autonomous vehicle technology proves as safe as or safer than human drivers in all conditions, the risks likely outweigh the benefits. Progress should continue carefully and gradually with safety as the guiding principle.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,1

As an older student, I would be able to help my younger peers in various ways, and I think they would greatly benefit from my guidance and experience.

One of the primary advantages of this program is that it would enable students to work together more effectively. By collaborating, they would be able to accomplish more work and achieve better results. Additionally, this program would encourage communication among students, which is crucial for building a strong and supportive classroom community.

Furthermore, I believe that older students are more responsible and trustworthy than younger ones. They have already gone through the same educational system and have a better understanding of how to navigate it. Therefore, they would be able to provide valuable insights and advice to their younger peers.

In addition to the benefits for the younger students, this program would also be beneficial for the older students. By helping their younger peers, they would be able to develop leadership skills and gain a sense of fulfillment from giving back to their community.

6903F409E831,"Dear Principal,

You are considering changing the school policy so only students with a grade B average or higher can participate in sports. I believe this is a good idea. Students should have to prove they are smart enough in the classroom to be rewarded with participating in school hosted sports or activities. If you agree to this new policy, many students already participating in the sport or activity will improve their grades to stay in the group. Changing the school's policy would prove that the school keeps standards high and that you give back to students who make good grades.

Students need to be able to prove that they are smart enough in the classroom to be rewarded with sports or clubs to join. Clubs and sports are extra-curricular activities and to join, you should not be failing any core class assigned to you by your school. Many groups a school will host are for providing a comfortable environment where you can make friends and learn something new, but not being able to learn what is necessary before hand proves you should not learn new information. Students should need to prove that they can pass a class to be rewarded with clubs and other activities to participate in.

Activating this new policy would force any students without a B average to work harder or stop participating in the activity. If you enforced this new policy, you would notice all the passing students and give them credit for all the excellent work they have produced. Any and all students, if they really cared about the activity, would try harder to keep or raise their standards, thus producing better grades. Activating this new policy is a great way to show the students what they are capable of doing and how to get there if they keep their grades high.

I believe this idea for making it a rule that having good grades will get you into sports activities is a fantastic idea and strongly hope that you apply it to our school. Many students would ttry harder and that is what school is al",0,persuade_corpus,,7
8fef4536,"The Electoral College should be kept for the voting of the President. There are many reasons to support this conclusion. When the people vote for a President, they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This can be a good and bad thing. The good thing is that the Electoral College keeps balance. The bad part is that some Americans see that is unfair that they cannot vote for a President directly.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance between small and large states as it says in paragraph 21. This means that it makes sure the election is fair, not one person can be voted president just because they campaigned in a larger state more people. The Electoral College also balances out the winners. They are the people who pick the clear winner when two candidates get tied. This happened to Nixon and Clinton. They both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes as it says in paragraph 22. In these kind of situations it is good to have a backup plan also known as the Electoral College.

Although the Electoral College is a helpful and fair way to vote, some Americans do not see it that way. In fact,over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now as it says in paragraph 9. There reasoning is that they cannot vote directly. They vote for a slate of electors who then vote for the president. They see this as unfair and think that they should be able to vote for the president directly. Below the 14th paragraph, it says ""lost the presidency: In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide,but Bush won the election,receiving 271 electoral votes to Gores 266."" Although this may seem unfair, the reality of it is that the Electoral College is just trying to keep the election for President fair. The Electoral College help to ensure that all of the candidates for President have a fair advantage. If the Electoral College wasnt there to balance out the voting, then the candidates could cheat. By cheat, this means that they could campaign in a bigger place of they could be from a different place than another president and have a unfair advantage because of the bigger population. If one president was from Texas and the other was from Florida, the candidate from Texas would have a unfair advantage because hes from a place with a bigger population. Why this is unfair is because if a candidate is from a area with a big population, the people in that area are most likely going to vote more towards that candidates side. In the last sentence of paragraph 21, it says ""Alarge state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than small states."" In the end, there are always going to be downfalls. The Electoral College may pick the opposite candidate that the majority of the people want, this is true. Also, the people may feel that it is wrong to not go with the peoples opinion. If the Electoral College was not there to decide, there would be all forms of chaos. As it says 1822, the candidates would have an unfair advantage.

B5106AB5C81C,"Title: The Pros and Cons of a Four-Day Work Week with Ten-Hour Days in School

As an 8th grader, I find the idea of a four-day work week with ten-hour days in school to be intriguing. While it may seem like a dream come true to have more time off, there are several implications to consider. In this essay, I will explore the potential impacts on students with part-time jobs, energy and resource conservation, and the potential drawbacks of this new schedule.

Firstly, a four-day work week with ten-hour days could have a significant impact on students with part-time jobs. These students may struggle to balance their school workload with their job responsibilities, leading to increased stress and decreased academic performance. Additionally, they may have to work longer hours to make up for the lost day, which could negatively affect their sleep schedule and overall well-being.

Secondly, a five-day work week with eight hours per day is more energy-efficient than a four-day work week with ten hours per day. With five days of school, students and teachers can spread out their workload more evenly, reducing the amount of energy consumed in the classroom. On the other hand, a four-day work week with ten hours per day would require more energy to light and heat the school, leading to increased resource consumption.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. A four-day work week with ten-hour days could lead to a decrease in student engagement and motivation. Students may find it challenging to focus and learn in a shorter amount of time, leading to lower academic achievement. Additionally, a four-day work week could result in increased traffic and congestion on the roads, as students and teachers commute to and from school.

In conclusion, while a four-day work week with ten-hour days in school may have some benefits, such as increased energy efficiency and reduced stress for students with part-time jobs, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. These include decreased student engagement and motivation, increased traffic and congestion, and the impact on students with part-time jobs.

088CB85E5B7A,"Often time, students will have to stay home from school for various reasons. This can cause them to get behind in their classes. They may get sick and not be able to go to school for one or more days; or, they may not have a way to get to school. Beacuse of staying home, students miss out on lessons and fall behind. If classes were available online this would not be an issue. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because there would be no sick days, they can work at their own pace, and there would be no wasted time.

Online classes would eliminate sick days almost entirely. Most of the time, the only reason students have to stay home from school is to prevent spreading the sickness they obtained. They would be able to safely get work done without having to leave his or her home. Other times, students stay home simply because they couldn't find a way to get to school. It would benefit them greatly if they could acess their classes online, in case they can't physically attend those classes. So, they would not have to miss out on lessons or fall behind.

Another reason students would benefit from attending classes online is that they would be able to work at their own pace. Frequently, students will feel overwhelmed in a classroom because the teacher or professor is teaching at a fast pace. Also, at home, they would be able to go to the restroom, get a drink of water, or something to eat while in a classroom they would not usually be able to do so. In addition, students would be able to listen to music while they work. Silence in a classroom can cause someone to get distracted more easily than they would listening to music.

Lastly, students would benefit from online classes because there is no wasted time. In school, a lot of time is wasted because of study hall or exploratory classes that are not needed. Time can even be wasted in core classes due to finishing work early and having nothing else to do. If a student were to work at home, time could be managed better for them personally. For example, a student could spend more time working on math than history, instead of spending the same amount of time on both. They could also do their work out of order to get assignments they see more important done first. This way, they would not have to wait around for the teacher to give the next assignment or wait for their next class to begin. Although, it is true some students may waste more time at home due to all the distrations, it would still be more benefical to take classes online because the students who waste time at home are the same students who waste time at school.

In conclusion, students would benefit from classes being available online. They would not miss out on anything from staying home and they could work at their own pace. Also, they would not be wasting valulable time. Every year, many students start getting bad grades due to missing new lessons or reviews. Attending classes at home would decrease the amount of students falling behind. Overall, making classes available online would be a very smart decision.Â    Â  Â  Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

a26ef41b57ab_04112023,"The photograph of the ""Face on Mars"" has sparked intense debate about whether this landform was created naturally or by an ancient civilization. As a scientist at NASA who studied this image closely, I do not believe there is sufficient evidence to support the idea that aliens carved this formation. Instead, I will argue that the ""Face on Mars"" is simply a coincidental arrangement of natural landforms on the Martian surface. 

One of my main claims is that the individual geometric shapes that make up the ""Face"" can each be explained as natural geological features common on Mars. For example, the two dark spots above the mouth that look like eyes are just impact craters, rounded depressions formed when meteorites collided with the planet's surface. Impact craters of varying sizes are abundant throughout Mars' history. Similarly, the triangular shape below that some see as a nose could easily be a mesa, a type of isolated hill created by erosion. Mesas with steep cliffs on one side and a gentle slope on others are widespread in Mars' terrain. 

I also have photographic evidence from NASA's Viking orbiter mission in the 1970s to support my argument. Upon closer examination of the original high-resolution image, the shapes that appear to form distinct features of a face become less clear and more ambiguous. The edges are indistinct and blurry, which is not what we would expect for artificial structures. But it is consistent with the known resolution limitations of the Viking cameras at that altitude. Additionally, images of the surrounding area do not reveal any other signs of an ancient civilization such as roads, buildings or other sculptures. If aliens sculpted one massive likeness, it seems unlikely they would stop there. 

In conclusion, while patterns in nature can sometimes look designed, the preponderance of evidence points to the ""Face on Mars"" being a random formation rather than the work of extraterrestrials. Although intriguing to imagine what life might exist beyond our planet, as scientists we must follow evidence, not speculation, in evaluating extraordinary claims. For these reasons, I remain convinced the ""Face on Mars"" was created by natural geological processes over millions of years, not by an alien civilization.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,4
EA3B2BC17E2A,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should require kids to partake in community service. It could help troubled kids out and take away the pressures in life. It could teach kids the meaning of helping others and to not be selfish. Community service can also help those who are in need of food or need a tutor to pass whichever grade they are in.

Community service could help the people who are involved in gangs to stop and help others. This one kid in the ninth grade was in a gang, but stopped because he started community service. If a gang member was trying to find something else to do besides be involved in gang affairs, he could do community service to stop his violent needs.

Community service would help those who need to learn to not be selfish. If someone was self centered and didn't care about anyone but himself/herself, they could perform community service to learn the value of helping others. If everyone would perform community service then not a lot of people would be self centered. A kid named OTHER_NAME was self centered until he got involved in community service.

If people in our school participated in community service, then the graduation rate of Texas graduation rate would go up. Also the number of homeless people could go down. The students that participate help tutor kids and help build houses. It might be a big responsibility, but I am positive we can manage to help people out. A fifth grader named OTHER_NAME

falcon_180b_v1_413,"I think that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. Dress codes create a positive learning environment by reducing distractions and promoting a sense of unity among students. If students are allowed to wear whatever they want, some may wear clothes that are inappropriate or too revealing, which can be distracting to other students and teachers.

For example, if a girl wears a very short skirt or shorts, boys in the class might get distracted and not focus on their studies. Similarly, if a boy wears a shirt with a violent or offensive image, it can create a negative atmosphere in the classroom. By having a dress code, students are required to dress appropriately for school, which helps to minimize these distractions.

Furthermore, dress codes help to promote a sense of unity and equality among students. When everyone is dressed similarly, it reduces the pressure to wear expensive or trendy clothes, which can create a divide between students who can afford those clothes and those who cannot. It also helps to reduce bullying, as students are not judged based on their clothing.

In conclusion, dress codes are beneficial to the school environment because they reduce distractions, promote equality, and create a positive learning atmosphere. Therefore, schools should continue to implement dress codes.",1,falcon_180b_v1,Many schools have implemented a dress code to create a positive learning environment.

1AE40323F062,"Did you know that asking multiple people for advice can help you make a better choice? Well, it can. The more people you ask, the more opinions you get from them, which, could lead you in a good direction. When you ask for advice, the most wisdom you could get is from family, your friends, or a counselor.

Asking people for advice may be good but asking your family is more helpful.

Since there your family, they might know whats best for you and what your going through.

They can help you out by asking if you wanted advice for a mistake you did or something that you want to accomplish.

Asking an older or younger sibling may help too.

Asking can help because most people are more closer to their siblings than their parents.

Getting advice from your family may be a bit more helpful because they can tell you the mistakes they have made in the past and for you to not make that mistake.

When they tell you the mistakes they've made, they will also tell you how you can learn from it. Your family may have given you advice, but also taught you to never give up even when times get hard.

Another person that can give you a different from of advice and wisdom would be a friend.

Friends are truthful so when you ask them for advice, they can give you their honest opinion.

when you ask for someones opinion, they are obviously going to tell you what they think and how it will impact you.

Your friend might have been through the same thing thats happening to you.

They could give you advice about it and hope to get better and prevent the outcomes. Advice coming from a friend is what most people need to understand it.

If your going through something or need advice, a counselor could also help you out.

Seeking multiple opinions could make you understand and give you varieties of advice for example, a counselor.

The counselor can advice you what to do right and whats wrong.

Counselors can give you different types of advice or wisdom that they previously told others that mayÂ help you.

From the multiple advises that the counselor gave you, you can choose the one that helped you the most and use it. If you go to different people for advice you have more of an idea of what their talking about.

When you are asking for advice from multiple people, the variety of wisdom that you can get is from your counselor, a friend, or your family members. However, some people think that they would rather keep everything to themselves and not ask any questions. They might not want to talk about it or they are already good with it and dont need advice. Getting advice from certain people may expand your choices.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â    Â  Â  Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
57A5CB844EF6,"Twenty five years ago something very uncommon happened on our planet Mars. NASA sent a shuttle taht can take pictures of anything, NASA sent the shuttle out into space. The shuttle NASA sent out was called ""Viking 1"". Viking 1 was a shuttle that took (past tence) pictures of plantes. NASA sent the shuttle out to look for possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. As the shuttle taking pictures it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. The Human face had a enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. Threw the cameras it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Those are some little details about the ""Human Face"".

Even though i'm a scientist at NASA, some of my friends who were also scientist we all agreed it was probably it was just another Martian mesa, they were common around Cydonia, but this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. I was dissusing the ""Face"" with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. I was telling him (John) we unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" But now that the word got out people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. He was also saying ""Its evidence that evidence that NASA would rather hide."" Me personally believed the Face was an alien artifact.

And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, so friends Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera which we called (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the original Viking photos. We were very anxious to see the picture... the picture revealed ... like we said a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

Everyone wasn't satisfied. The Face on Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter April '98 which was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camrea on board MGS had to peer though wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

So then I ordered mission controllers to look again. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that looks straight down and scans teh planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips.

April 8, 2001 coudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough fro a second look. They had to roll the Space craft 25 degrees to center the Fce in the field of view. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best Viking photo. Meaning in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there we objects in this pictures like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks youll know where they were.

The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms. So they we never alien sights. Even though John never blieved what i said.                     ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
876DD6D022A9," Do you believe that confidence comes from achievement or self-esteem? There are different opinions on this matter, with some people believing that self-esteem comes after achieving something, while others believe that confidence is necessary to achieve success. In my opinion, confidence is the key to achieving success.

Firstly, confidence is necessary to work hard and learn new things. For instance, learning a new language requires a lot of effort and dedication. It is not easy to learn a new language, especially when the words and grammar rules are different from your native language. However, with confidence, you can overcome these challenges and keep learning every day.

Secondly, confidence is necessary to achieve your goals. When you set a goal for yourself, you need to believe in your ability to achieve it. If you lack confidence, you will be hesitant to take action and may give up easily. However, with confidence, you will be motivated to work towards your goals and overcome any obstacles that come your way.

Lastly, confidence is necessary to handle failure. Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it is essential to learn from it. However, if you lack confidence, you may be discouraged by failure and may give up easily. However, with confidence, you will be able to handle failure and learn from it, which will help you to achieve success in the long run.

The electoral college is not a fair way for citizens to vote in the untied states. the popular vote system would work at so much more better for citizen. It would give them more of a say in the vote and more people would vote

First reason I think popular vote is better than electoral college is because it gives citizen more of a say in what goes on in the voting process. the reason for this if the popular vote was the system they used you will be voting on a actual president. not voting for someone to pick your president for you. so this clearly shows that voting using the popular voting syste gives people more of a say in the voting process. yes it might be unfair to smaller states who have less people but still.

Second reason i picked this thing was because well more people would vote. the reason more peole would vote is because they will feel theyhave more of a say in things. for instance if someone told you you can have more freedom or none you will pick freedom. so clearly this shows that more people would vote if they we used the popular vote system instead of the other one. yes the other one still lets you vote but not for a president

So in conclusion popular vote is way better than regular voting because you have more freedom anf you vote for a actual president    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
7AC357DAA5D7,"Positive attitude plays a crucial role in achieving success in life. The way we think and approach challenges shapes our outcomes. Research has shown that people with positive attitudes are more likely to achieve their goals and lead happy lives.

In everyday life, having a positive attitude can help us navigate through challenges and obstacles. When we face problems, we often have the choice to either see them as opportunities or threats. People with a positive attitude see challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, while those with a negative attitude view them as obstacles that will only lead to failure.

In the workplace, a positive attitude can help employees work more efficiently and effectively. When we have a positive attitude, we are more motivated to achieve our goals, and we are more likely to work collaboratively with others. On the other hand, a negative attitude can lead to conflicts and a lack of productivity.

During times of need, having a positive attitude is especially important. When we face difficult situations, such as illness or financial hardship, a positive attitude can help us cope and find solutions. People with a positive attitude are more likely to seek help and support, while those with a negative attitude may feel hopeless and helpless.

A negative attitude can prevent one from prospering in many ways. When we have a negative attitude, we tend to focus on the negative aspects of a situation, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and stress. This can affect our physical and mental health, making it harder for us to achieve our goals. Additionally, a negative attitude can lead to poor decision-making, as we may overlook important information or opportunities.

In conclusion, positivity is crucial in achieving success in life. It helps us navigate through challenges, work more efficiently, and cope during times of need. By remaining optimistic, we can improve our overall well-being and increase our chances of achieving our goals.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,8
A656ACA2DF15,"In the arcticle it states how driverless cars are in planning and in the process of being made. Technology is increasing every year and I believe by the year of 2020 it will be more advanced than it has ever been. I have to say in my opinion I am against driverless cars.

I have my reasons of why I am against driverless cars.

In the text it states that the driverless cars in the making still require human ability.

I believe that humans should be in control of the car so their is no malfunction.

I would not trust the car driving on its own.

Technonoly is not perfect their are screwups, and one screwup from a driverless car can cost the life of someone.

Driverless cars dont just have cons though they have pros.

One pro is that if someones is drunk they can get in the car and not have to control it and having the risk on getting into a dangerous accident.

According to the text it says that the car system is a safety feature. This can be true, but everyday technology advances, and humans become more and more accustomed to it.

Though technology is a wonderful thing to use and have, I believe that it is also harmful.

Now in this time period we are used to technology doing things for us, this can lead us to not think for ourselves or do things for ourselves.

Back in the old times humans did things for themselves some of the greatest minds of our times changed the world and how we live today but if technology begins to increase and think for us humans wont be able to learn for themselves or experience different things.

Our mind will be closed off from the world.

Our creativity level can decrease.

One thing that most of us go through and experience is driving.

In the text it claims that the cars have navigating systems that will lead the car to go where we want it to without driving.

We wont need our sense of direction or our thinking to solve where to go to get to our destination.

The whole point is we will not use our brains and think for ourselves but we will let technology think for us.

We will not increase our minds in the sense of obtaining more knowledge because we wont know or have a clue of what to do.

We will simply be cut off from learning or experiencing things or situsations for ourselves.

These factors play a major part in day to day life.

llama_70b_v11148,"In recent years, there has been a growing trend of incorporating meditation and mindfulness practices into the daily routine of schools. While some argue that these practices have numerous benefits for students, others believe that they have no place in the school curriculum. In this essay, I will argue for the inclusion of meditation and mindfulness practices in schools, highlighting the various advantages they offer and refuting potential criticisms.

Firstly, meditation and mindfulness practices have been shown to have a positive impact on students' mental health and wellbeing. In today's fast-paced world, young people are often overwhelmed with stress, anxiety, and pressure to perform well academically. Meditation and mindfulness practices help students develop the skills to manage these emotions effectively, leading to improved mental health and resilience. Studies have shown that regular meditation can reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and ADHD in children and adolescents. (Harris et al., 2016) Moreover, mindfulness practices have been linked to increased self-awareness, self-regulation, and empathy, which are essential life skills that can benefit students beyond the classroom. (Kerr et al., 2018)

Secondly, meditation and mindfulness practices can improve students' academic performance and focus. By teaching students how to calm their minds and concentrate, these practices can enhance their ability to learn and retain information. Research has shown that mindfulness training can improve cognitive function, particularly attention and working memory, in both children and adults. (Zeidan et al., 2010) Additionally, meditation has been found to increase creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, all of which are vital for academic success. (Kerr et al., 2018)

Thirdly, incorporating meditation and mindfulness practices into schools can foster a more positive and harmonious school environment. These practices promote social-emotional learning, which can help students develop essential skills such as communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution. (Durlak et al., 2011) By teaching students how to be more aware of their thoughts, feelings, and actions, mindfulness practices can reduce aggressive behavior, bullying, and peer pressure. (Latzman et al., 2016)

Despite the numerous benefits of meditation and mindfulness practices, some critics argue that they have no place in the school curriculum. They claim that schools should focus solely on academic subjects and that these practices are a waste of valuable time. However, this view neglects the fact that mental health, social-emotional learning, and wellbeing are just as important as academic achievement. Moreover, incorporating meditation and mindfulness practices into schools can actually enhance academic performance, as discussed earlier.

Others argue that these practices are too ""hippie"" or ""new-age"" and may not be suitable for all students. However, this view is based on a misunderstanding of what meditation and mindfulness practices entail. These practices are not religious or spiritual; they are simply techniques that can be practiced by anyone, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds. (Kerr et al., 2018)

In conclusion, incorporating meditation and mindfulness practices into schools has numerous benefits for students' mental health, academic performance, and social-emotional learning. These practices are not a waste of time, but rather an essential component of a well-rounded education. By teaching students how to manage stress, focus their minds, and develop essential life skills, meditation and mindfulness practices can help create a more positive and harmonious school environment. Therefore, I strongly argue in favor of the inclusion of these practices in schools.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Some schools have implemented meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day.

94DDDE49F8DA,"Dear Mr. Principal,

I have noticed that there is a diversion between students in our school who take part in community service, and those who do not. These students who take part in community service are putting their best efforts to helping their local environment, schools, and families. Those who don't take part in community service are not hurting only themselves, but also hurting those around them who need help. They would rather do what they want, and not what needs to be done. They will never feel the satisfaction of knowing they helped someone in need, nor will they ever feel appreciated by those who needed help. I strongly believe that all students in our school should be required to take part in community service.

Students should not have a choice to participate or not. If it were required, some students may not enjoy it at first, but I assure you that once their time is done they will appreciate the satisfaction they receive for taking part in helping to do something that would not be possible without them. Why wouldn't you choose to do this? The major outcome of adding this requirement to your curriculum would only be positive. This would help students realize what they can do if they really try, and this would help many people and places that need it.

If you choose not to do this it will effect many people. This will effect the students who so far have chosen not to take part in community service. This is because since they have not chosen to help yet, if they are not required, I'm sure they wont change their mind any time soon. This could also effect many areas who need help because less people will be going to clean up local places, or help local people who need it. If you choose to do this, as I already said you will be helping many people. That is why I strongly believe that all students in our school should be required to take part in community service.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student",0,persuade_corpus,,5
4332C80A5690,"I do not think students will benefit from attending class from home because even though it may seem easier and more fun students will be missing various skill that can be only be gained in school,and they will face other obstacles along the way like:procrastination,lack of peer resources,and loss of hands on experience.

Students who attend classes from home will be in the comfort of their home which is the exact reason it wont benefit them. Being in the comfort of your home will tempt students to loose track and not stay focused while in a school environment there are teachers who make that task almost impossible. Also,students who take school from home will procrastinateÂ much more because of the fact that there arent technically any peers to help them get back on track.

Which me brings me to my next point ,peers. They are a fundamental part of life, they help us and change us to be a better person,but for students who take school from home they lack the support of peers and teachers. Which ultimately leaves them out of the experience of a real life scenario because in real life you will be surrounded by people and wont be in the comfort of your home. School has the ability to teach you those skills you need when you grow up, and in schoolÂ they not only teach you the skills but make you apply them in the school environment which leads you to be better prepared in the future.

That brings me to my final point which is students being prepared for the future. Students who take in school classes learn necessary skills that they will use throughout their life;for example,public speaking,social conduct,and time management. These are important skills that students can only learn in school and students take online school will be missing out on these benefits because with online school your only interaction is with a computer screen which gives you no no life skills whatsoever. Students who take online school gain no benefit from it because it offers no vial skill ; the only skill they can gain is following textbook concept tutorials that have no emotion behind them(another lack of peer resource).

Ultimately,online class may seem like a better alternative but the cons clearly outweigh the pros leaving you with nothing but a screen to look at and a future that you arent ready for.   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
llama_70b_v11105,"Single-use plastics have become a major concern for our environment. They are convenient to use, but their impact on the environment is alarming. Plastic bags, straws, and water bottles are some of the most commonly used single-use plastics. The question is, should we ban them? In my opinion, we should ban single-use plastics. In this essay, I will argue for the ban of single-use plastics and provide reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, single-use plastics are a major contributor to pollution. Plastic bags, straws, and water bottles are used once and then discarded, often ending up in our oceans and landfills. According to the United Nations, if we don't take action to reduce plastic waste, there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050. This is a scary thought, and it's our responsibility to make sure that we don't leave a polluted planet for future generations. By banning single-use plastics, we can significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in our environment.

Secondly, single-use plastics are harmful to wildlife. Sea turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them, causing blockages in their digestive system. Birds get entangled in plastic bags and six-pack rings, causing injury or death. According to the World Wildlife Fund, plastic waste kills an estimated 100,000 marine animals each year. This is unacceptable, and we need to take action to protect our wildlife. By banning single-use plastics, we can help protect marine animals and reduce the harm that plastic waste causes to our environment.

Thirdly, single-use plastics are not sustainable. They are made from non-renewable resources like petroleum, which are finite. Once they are used and discarded, they cannot be reused or recycled. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, only 9% of plastic waste is recycled in the United States. This means that the majority of single-use plastics end up in landfills or the environment. By banning single-use plastics, we can reduce our reliance on non-renewable resources and promote sustainability.

Finally, there are alternatives to single-use plastics. We can use reusable bags, stainless steel straws, and refillable water bottles. These alternatives are not only better for the environment, but they are also cost-effective. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, if every household in the United States replaced just one package of single-use plastic bags with reusable bags, we could save $1.5 billion per year. This is a significant amount of money that could be saved by making a simple change.

In conclusion, single-use plastics have a negative impact on our environment, wildlife, and sustainability. By banning single-use plastics, we can reduce pollution, protect wildlife, promote sustainability, and save money. There are alternatives to single-use plastics, and it's our responsibility to make a change. I strongly believe that we should ban single-use plastics and make a transition to a more sustainable future.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The use of single-use plastic products has become a controversial topic due to its impacts on the environment.

BC1B132DB385,"Some schools have started to require students to complete projects over the summer to show that they are still learning even during their break. If students have a project to complete during their summer break do they get to design what the project is or do the teachers do that? Having students design the project may be beneficialÂ in getting them to be interested in it. On the other hand, if teachers design the project then it may be helpful for lessons during the school year.

Having the students design their own summer project gives them more freedom to create and find things that interest them. For example, in English we were able to write a story about anything we saw fit. This got me to think outside of the box and create something that I am very proud of. Giving students the freedom to create their own projects also effects in their diversity an personality show making it unique.

Their reason being is that if teachers plan the project, they could use it as a refrence for lessons later in the school year. However, most students have a hard time with receivingÂ a ""template"" form of a project.

First off, let me say that im not a big fan of veggies. Never have been, never will be. But, i do see the point of cutting down on meat. For one, its better for the enviroment. All them cows and pigs and chickens, they let out all kinds of bad stuff that hurts the air and the water. And it takes alot of land and food to raise them. If we ate less meat, we could use that land for other things and help the planet out.

Also, eating less meat is better for our health. Meat has alot of fat and cholestrol, which can give you heart desease and other problems. And theres all kinds of gross stuff they put in meat, like antibiotics and hormones. Yuck.

But, on the other hand, im not sure i want to give up meat all together. I mean, what about bacon? Bacon is the best. And steak? Theres nothing like a good steak. And chicken wings? Forget about it.

So, maybe the way to go is to just cut down on meat. Instead of having it every day, maybe have it a few times a week. Or, only eat it on special occasions. That way, we can still enjoy the tasty stuff but also do our part for the earth and our health.

Such as, if you have a job at home or anywhere else to work. For instances, like taking care your little sibling or stay home with your friends kids.

How it could be a fewer disturb? For example, This girl name Generic_Name. her parents moved to Virginia. She attend to Generic_School as a new students doing her first day she didn't learn nothing nothing all. Because her classmates was too busy messing around. After she go home talk to her family and parents, so their decide to make her stay home take her classes online, so she won't have to listen to her classmates messing around anymore for now on she got time to study and focus at the same time without anybody disturb her.

Has a students you taking online classes you could work in your own private space. For example, Generic_Name was a very kind person. He doesn't like a lot noise, so doing his first lessons he found like a private room he could go to take his class at his house without no one interrupt him. Generic_Name thoughtÂ it was fantasy to enter the room sit down in a chair in front of his laptop, put on his headphone and started watching his professor give him the lessons. Also without listen to others tell him to do something he's not supposed to do.

Has a students taking online classes you got more time to relaxing such as taking care your personal business also. For example, Generic_Name is taking night classes. His classes will started at 10:00 PM He doesn't need to get up like other students to. For instances, if Generic_Name working day time. At dollar general heÂ will started around 7:00 am to 8:00 pm. Basically he will have time come home and chill out, and started his classes.

Students should be request to taking online classes. People may argue say that is wrong students are not learning nothing by online classes. However, they wrong taking online classes will benefit the student and so many way. First reason, fewer disturb. For example. no time to messingÂ around with other just focus and only one section that's it. Second. more quite. For instance, sometime people need a quite time, so their brain could gain more knowledge. Finally, you got time to taking care your personal business.

63AB55DADABF,"Hey, so I'm totally against the idea of extending the school day by one and a half hours. I know some people might think it's a good idea, but let me tell you why I think it's not.

First of all, students like me are already super busy with extracurricular activities, homework, and stuff. Adding more time to the school day would just make it harder for us to balance everything. I know some people might say, ""But won't it be good for students to have more time in the classroom?"" Uh, no. I mean, maybe for some people, but not for me. I'm already struggling to keep up with my workload as it is. Adding more time to the day would just make it harder for me to get everything done.

And don't even get me started on the drivers. Like, imagine if school got out later and more kids were on the roads. It would be super dangerous. There are already enough accidents happening during rush hour, and adding more kids to the mix would just make it worse. Plus, it would be really frustrating for parents who have to pick up their kids later. They'd have to work longer hours or something, and that's not fair to them.

And let's not forget about the teachers. They're already working super hard as it is. They don't need to be stuck in school even longer. They deserve some time off too. I mean, they're like, our superheroes or something. They teach us everything and keep us safe, and they deserve some recognition.

llama_70b_v16,"The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that can detect human emotions. It's like a computer program that can read your face and know how you're feeling. Some people think it's a good idea to use this technology in classrooms to see how students are feeling. But I don't think it's a good idea.

First of all, it's an invasion of privacy. Students should be able to express their emotions without being monitored by a computer. It's like having a camera in the classroom that's always watching you. It would make me feel really uncomfortable.

Secondly, it's not always accurate. The article says that the technology can mistake one emotion for another. So, if a student is actually feeling sad, the computer might say they're angry. That could cause problems. Imagine if a teacher thought a student was angry when they were really just sad. It could lead to misunderstandings and unfair treatment.

Another thing is that it could be used to manipulate students. If a teacher knows how a student is feeling, they could use that information to try to control their behavior. That's not right. Students should be treated with respect and not used as experiments for new technology.

Finally, it's not necessary. Teachers can already tell how students are feeling by looking at their faces and body language. They don't need a computer program to do it for them. It's a waste of money and time.

In conclusion, using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is not a good idea.

I think you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class time.

My suggestions are because, students have freedom when they leave their home and sometime parents need to know the condition their child is in especially if their alone after school or before. Phones should also be permitted on school grounds to the due of, when there's an emergency he/she could contact their legal guardian at any free given time they could. For some students after school have activities and need to bring their cell phone to school if their going to nee it in the after noon to call to be picked up, or what ever the situation is.

Cell phones now days, have trackers to keep up with your child if he/she is in some sort of danger if he/she isn't in school. Also some parents even work late or early and sometimes need to let their child know if they'll be home or not, such as my parents do with me. To myself and others in this school we ask very understandably if you could take a second thought on reconsidering the school cell phone policy. I believe policy 1 is better.

darragh_claude_v7_702,"I believe students can benefit from the option of distance learning classes from home under certain conditions. While in-person classes have advantages, distance learning provides flexibility that could help many students.

Distance learning allows students to learn on a schedule that works best for their individual needs and lifestyle. Some students have jobs, family responsibilities, health issues or long commute times that make regular classroom attendance difficult. Learning from home reduces barriers to participation. It also gives students more control over managing their time and environment during classes. They don't have to worry about interruptions from other students or getting to school on time.

However, distance learning is not ideal for all students or subjects. Being physically present in a classroom provides structure, accountability and face-to-face interaction that is important for many students and teachers. It is easier for teachers to gauge students' understanding and engagement in real time. Some classes like lab sciences, performing arts or career-technical programs require hands-on equipment and facilities that are difficult to replicate virtually. 

To make distance learning effective, it is important that schools provide adequate technology resources, teacher training and student support services. Teachers need guidance on maintaining interactive lessons, assessing students remotely and building an online community. Students would need reliable internet access, self-motivation skills and opportunities to connect with peers. Distance classes should not replace traditional options but act as a supplement for those who truly need or want the flexibility. 

With proper implementation and oversight, distance learning can be a valuable option that increases access to education without compromising academic standards or the classroom experience for other students. A blended model of both in-person and online instruction, based on individual student needs, seems most likely to benefit the largest number of learners. Overall, most students would benefit from having the choice available for at least part of their education.",1,darragh_claude_v7,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

So, why is it important to have encouragement and motivation to be successful in life? Well, let's face it, life can be hard sometimes. Like, really hard.

All Americans do is drive everywhere,they never think about how driving effects the air and the temperature of this planet. Maybe we can be like Africa and have nothing at all. Or just maybe appreciate that we actually have something. Why would we ever get rid of cars? I do not know,but i do know that getting rid of cars is really stupid. Well as i was asked im now going to explain to you how getting rid of cars is ""good"".

One reason why getting rid of cars could be good is that you wont have to really worry about the greenhouse gases that are emmited by the exhaust pipes. Your air will be as clean as a whistle. The only thing bad about that is that those gases actually keep some places warm,but to other people it justs ""melts the ice caps."".

Another reason why getting rid of cars is good is that there will be less traffic and fewer accidents. So you'll get to work a little bit later than usual but you'll get there safe. You wont have to worry about about spending thousands of dollars every time you need a new ride,just a couple of hundreds. People rarely get their licences anyways so it doesnt really matter.

D42B6354404D,"Dear Principal

I think we students should at least have a B average to play sports, that would make it fair for who tries their best in school, but i bet that those who really love sports would try their best in all their classes. Students who do not try their be st and don't like sports they could just stay with whatever grade they get because they deserve it. Students who also have a bad attitude should not get to play either. If students really want to play sports or join activities they would really try hard not to be bad. If students have a 69 or below they should not let them play sports until they have a passing grade.

If many of the students have a C average they should try harder on their work for those who love sports and who like to join activities. I bet students who have a C average are mad because they cant play sports until they get a C average. I would like to convince the principal that they should at least get a B average. All students have to do is listen in class and pass all the test that teachers give out so you could pass the class and be able to pass your class and you'll be able to play what ever sport you want.

Students and people who try their best will always get everything they want because they do everything said and everything they tell them to do. doing everything they ask you to do will make you a good person. If you try your best you will get to play sports and join in activities you like.

First and foremost, NASA wouldn't just release the image of the Face on Mars to the whole world if we weren't sure their was some investigating to do regarding how the landform actually was formed. Not only that but if we weren't 100% sure if the landform was safe towards the lives of our fellow people then we would try to figure out whats going on until we actually tell the public what were really facing up against here, and that's even if we need to release the issue to the world it might be a very minor problem that can be fixed and or destroyed with our amazing team.

Secondly, with the technology we have today our team would've definitely knew something was up the first time we saw it. Honestly, these theories and assumptions that aliens or how other unknown creatures made that face, shows that we are not all on the same page. In certain ways it even shows offense toward NASA by questioning our research.

Finally, if this Face was created by another type of life that we may not know about then we most likely would've known about it by now. Quite frankly I think it's best if we don't ever come face-to-face with those different types of unknown life considering they may be way more advanced than our civilization with more advanced technology and many other things that mankind isn't ready for yet. They may end up being the enemy instead of the friend and that could very much jepordize mankind.

Furthermore, I could go on and on about how this is just another rock on an ever bigger rock, but you will still have your opinions and I will still have my research. I just hope that I have given you a better thought of what this whole fiasco people have caused really is instead of giving them false information. Thank you for reading.

9385B4D84BFC,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. There are more facts to prove that aliens have nothing to do with the Face on Mars. There are less facts to prove that aliens did it. Use commen sense. Don't assume somethig without having facts to back it up.

The first fact that tells us that it was not aliens is, scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" This tells us that aliens didn't make it, and that it just formed from shadows that made it look like a face on mars when it was just an illusion.

In the text it states, thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

Furthermore, the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. ""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Those were some facts that tell us that aliens didn't have nothing to do with the Face on Mars. It was just an illusion. It made people wonder if there was life on Mars or if there use to be an ancient civilzation on Mars. But, in the end it was just a rock formation. There are more facts to back up that aliens didn't do it. There are less facts to prove that aliens did do it. People saw the picture of the Face on Mars and assumed it had to do with aliens since it looked so much like a face. But, its best to not assume something before you have strong facts to back it up. The Face on Mars isn't forgotten though. It's still something amazing that happend on Mars. It was the first time that something so amazing was caught on camara on Mars. It might never be seen again.

C928D32FE5C5," Are vacations a necessity for our success? Why do we need them? While some argue that inactivity gives us time to reinvent ourselves, others believe that it leads to procrastination. Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up and allows us time for new ideas.

Inactivity is essential because it helps us maintain our motivation and energy levels. For example, during a long day at work, it's easy to become tired and lose focus. Taking a short break can help refresh your mind and give you the energy you need to finish the day strong. In fact, studies have shown that taking breaks during work can actually increase productivity and creativity.

Inactivity also allows us to reflect on our work and come up with new ideas. Taking a break from our daily routine can give us a fresh perspective and help us see things from a different angle. This can lead to new insights and innovations that we might not have considered otherwise. For example, many entrepreneurs find that taking a break from their business can help them come up with new ideas and strategies for growth.

It's important to note that inactivity does not necessarily mean laziness. In fact, taking breaks can actually be a form of self-care and can help us maintain our mental and physical health. Taking time to rest and recharge can help us avoid burnout and improve our overall well-being.

In conclusion, vacations and inactivity serve a purpose in our lives. They help us maintain our motivation and energy levels, allow us to reflect on our work and come up with new ideas, and help us maintain our mental and physical health. So, the next time you're feeling overwhelmed, take a break and give yourself the time and space you need to recharge and refocus.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

9F9FBC5BF6B3,"A student presents their self-designed science project: it is a box of dry ice and a research paper on the properties of the peculiar substance. The project has a valid topic, but it is almost irrelevant to the curriculum of the class. A month later, the student realizes that the summer project should have been some sort of a review of the graphing unit last year---which they had forgotten completely. A summer project is meant to preserve the necessary knowledge from the year before and to prepare the student for the upcoming year. If the project's design includes and practices irrelevant information, then its purpose is completely undermined. In order to avoid this, a summer project should be designed by teachers instead of students because they know the curriculum well, will take it seriously, and can use it as an opportunity to set the expectations for the upcoming school year.

It is most logical and effective for a teacher to design summer projects. As the people who teach the class, teachers are the ones who will know what skills the students must practice in order to succeed in the class.

Therefore, there is no one better fit to prepare the students than the teacher. Only they have the knowledge and expertise to coordinate what the class will require and what the students will be able to give. In Michigan, a student designed a summer project for math, but upon arrival to school, they realize that they focused on the least prevalent and useful topic. It would have been considerably more beneficial to the student if the project were designed according to the curriculum of the class. However, the students simply do not know the curriculum like the teachers do. If they have never taken the class, they would not know what they supposed to focus on for a summer assignment. The teacher, however, would and should be the one to design summer projects.

A student would not treat a summer project with as much seriousness as a teacher would. Through observation, it can be seen that the majority of the teen population does not stay ambitious or dedicated to school during the summer time. Due to this, it makes no sense why teachers would trust students to dedicate their time and effort into designing a well-thought out project instead of dismissing it so that they may enjoy their summer. Teens want to forget about school as summer time comes around, they do not want to spend it preparing for more school. For instance, if a student has the choice between an easy project or a truly helpful, but complicated and tedious project, observation shows that they are most likely to choose the easier option. Teachers should design the project because they would not be as tempted to simplify the project for the sake of their own self desires like students may. In the earlier situation, teachers would most likely choose the harder project because they know it would benefit the students in the long run. Since teachers would be more responsible and serious with the project, they are the ideal designers for it.

A summer project would show students what to expect during the school year if they were designed by teachers. For example, a highly detailed and extensive project would indicate a rigorous class. The projects are an opportunity for teachers to introduce and exemplify the expectations of the students---in this case, high expectations. This sneak peek into class life would hopefully prevent unpreparedness from students and help the class run more smoothly. Teacher-designed projects have also been shown to benefit students by preventing a switch of classes during the school year: a junior at Generic_School decides to switch out of her Spanish 5 class during the summer after attempting the summer assignment. If it were designed by the teacher, it would be just like assignments from the class itself. This demonstrates the advantage of having the opportunity to work on an assignment that mirrors the work done in a possible class: a student essentially gains the ability to do a test run to see if they like it or not. That junior would have gotten stuck in the class and performed poorly if it were not for the summer assignment. Therefore, summer assignments should be designed by teachers to give students an idea of what to expect and what is expected of them.

Teachers are the best fit to design summer assignments for students because, unlike teens with only fun and relaxation on their minds who would not take the project seriously, teachers can create an assignment that will prepare the student for the specified curriculum and demonstrate what they expect from them. This should have tremendous benefits when it comes to student preparedness, class switches, and student success. A student-designed project may sound like a good idea because it opens up the opportunity for students to be creative and show what they know, however, in reality, most students simply will not put enough effort into it. Perhaps if teenagers were more passionate about school during the summer it would work, but until then, teachers remain the best candidate for designing summer assignments.",0,persuade_corpus,,0

The FACS would help us in learning about how exactly how someone is feeling about something or someone. Say, if they could exactly explain how they are feeling we could use the FACS to figure out their emotions. We could also use it in classroom as paragraph 6 says. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" We would finally have the technology to help people who don't understand or are to shy to ask how to do something in the class. The computer would recognize that facial action and go more in depth to help the people who don't understand. Yes, it would make people lose their jobs and bore the other students who already understand the topic but we're still in the beginning faze of the FACS. By using the system we would become way more advanced and learn how to fix these problems. It just takes time to go over and fix. Imagine if we didn't have facial expressions.

We've grown adapted to having such a skill but some people don't know how to tell or just can't tell very well. We now put it into technology to help those people and ourselves!

de79afbce865_04112023,"Dear Principal Johnson, 

I am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. I believe this is an excellent idea that will benefit both our students and our community. 

Participating in community service teaches young people important life lessons. It shows students that we all have a responsibility to help others and help improve our local neighborhoods. Through tutoring, litter cleanup, or other types of service work, students learn valuable skills like teamwork, leadership, and empathy for those in need. They also experience the personal fulfillment that comes from helping their fellow citizens. These are skills and qualities that will serve our students well as they continue their education and begin their careers.

Requiring community service would also have significant benefits for our community. As you know, our city struggles with issues like lagging test scores, blighted areas, and a lack of mentors for youth. By involving our entire student body, we can make a real difference. Students would be able to tutor dozens of elementary students, clean up entire streets and parks, and help countless community organizations. The positive impact on our city would be immense and long-lasting.

In summary, a mandatory community service program is a win-win situation. It strengthens the character of our students while providing much-needed services to residents. Although it may cause some short-term inconvenience, the long-term rewards for students and community alike makes it well worth the effort. For these reasons, I strongly urge you to implement this important policy. Our students and our city will be much better off as a result.

48D7F6B4B788,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am a student at your school currently and I've noticed that many students do not do much community service. I myself do not do much either, but I think there are ways that you and other's in our school can help the community.

I am not promoting that students have mandatory community service, I would just like it if you promote community service. What I am trying to get across is, have fundraiser's in school or allow speakers to come in to show what we can do. Many students believe that community service is a waste of their time. By forcing them to do community service, they will feel even less obliged to do so. Allowing kids to see what is going on in the world will allow them to think of how they can help.

One example of promoting community service is having a public speaker come in. Someone who has worked to help the community already. Students will know that the person has done community service and knows what it's like. Students can relate to that person. Also, the person will persuade my fellow students to help the less fortunate or just the community.

Another example of promoting community service would be having fundraiser's in school. Gathering can's food for those who don't have any. Go to a nearby shelter and entertain the people there whom are less fortunate.

If you do these things, or things along these lines I can guarantee that more students will be participating in community activities. As I said earlier, many students believe community service is a waste of time. Most of those students spend their weekends sitting in front of a television screen. I admit that I do that to over some weekends, but showing kids that they can make a difference will give them the ability to get off the couch and go help the community. There will be a significantly larger amount of kids that help the community. Though it may not be a significant amount of help, it's better than no help.

These are my views on how we should deal with students and community service. I hope you at least take them into consideration. Promoting community service will be very helpful, and it can also help students get into better schools in the future.

Sincerely,

813FEB14DE3C,"Receiving advice from others is like having someone else pick out your clothes; a weight is being lifted off you shoulders. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, for they will receive advice from others with more experience, it will help them grow as a individual, and it will be an eye opener to their situation.

To begin with, asking others for advice can benefit one in many ways. The person who they may be asking may be more experienced in the subject and help them out with their situation. For example, Generic_Name just began attending a new school. He has tried his best to make friends but he has failed. Generic_Name, very discouraged, decided to ask his mom for some pointers on how to make friends. When he got home from school he went right into the kitchen to ask his mom for some help. His mom simply said, ""Be yourself, they will come around, trust me."" Generic_Name was frustrated because he was being his self but they just looked at him like he was an alien. He knew it was time to turn to his older sister, Generic_Name. Later that evening when Generic_Name came home from basketball practice he knew it time to ask her what to do. After she had gotten settled he went into her room knowing she was his only hope. Generic_Name told him that, ""You are the new kid, fresh meat. Give them a break and do not try as hard to want their attention. The best way to gain someones attention is to not want it."" After doing exactly what his sister said to do, two of the boys from his gym class came and sat beside him at lunch. Generic_Name could have just went with his moms advice, but after talking to his sister he has now made two new friends.

Also, asking the advice of others helps one to grow. When someone asks for help they tend to remember how to deal with those specific situations later on in life. For instance, Generic_Name is struggling in her math class. Every time the class has a test she always finishes first, that is why she does not understand why her grades are not good in Ms. Generic_Name's math class. She told Generic_Name, ""I do not get it, I always finish my work first! I do not understand why I continue to get bad grades in here."" Ms. Generic_Name told her that, ""Not everything is a race Generic_Name. The test are not timed so there is no need to rush."" Generic_Name was very confused, she did not understand she thought if she finished fast that meant because she was so smart and did not need the extra time. When Generic_Name came to class the next day she asked her friends how they get such good grades on the test and they all said in a cautious tone, ""Read the questions carefully! Ms. Generic_Name is always trying to trick us."" When Ms. Generic_Name entered the classroom she announced to the class that they had a pop quiz. Generic_Name still thinking of what her teacher and friends told her took her time on the pop quiz and earned an ninety five percent. Generic_Name was so proud. From now on Generic_Name knew that in order to make good grades she would have to just slow down a bit and take her time. Like Ms. Generic_Name said, ""Slow and steady wins the race, or in this case receives a good grade.""

In addition, taking the advice from others can help one to see the situation from a different point of view. Sometimes a person looking from the outside in on the situation may just help find a solution to it. Specifically, Generic_Name and Generic_Name have been best friends for forever and they do everything together. Every summer Generic_Name and Generic_Name go to basketball camp together but not this year. Generic_Name just got excepted into the Generic_City Summer Science Camp she has been trying to get into since the first grade. Generic_Name was so excited she had to call up her best friend Generic_Name and tell her the great news except Generic_Name did not think it was so great. When summer came around for the first time they had to go their separate ways to different camps. Generic_Name was really mad but she still missed her best friend the whole summer. Generic_Name, on the other hand was loving science camp she wrote to Generic_Name everyday trying to see how she was doing and telling how the great time she was having. Generic_Name decided that she was not going to write Generic_Name back in return of her just up and leaving her for science camp. When the girls returned back to school Generic_Name ignored Generic_Name which left her sad and confused. Generic_Name had no idea why she was acting that way she decided to ask their other friends if any of them knew why Generic_Name was acting that way but no one knew. When Generic_Name got home for her first day back to school she was greeted by her mom who was now confused as to why she looked so upset. She shared with her mom what was going on and her mom knew exactly what was wrong with Generic_Name. ""Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name's mom said, ""She may be hurt because you left her you two do everything together."" Generic_Name now realizing what she had done ran up the steps and immediately called Generic_Name and apologized. Generic_Name was happy that her mom talked to her or she might have lost her best friend. That just goes to show that sometime having another person view the situation can help come up with a better solution.

However, some people feel that taking the advice from others is useless. They feel that solving their own problems helps them become a stronger individual. Other may not like everyone being in their business because they may be a more private individual. Getting advice from other may not be the best thing because some people feel they know what is right and may think they know how to fix the situation but they do not. On the contrary, I feel that asking others for advice is a great idea.

In conclusion, these are all reasons why everyone should ask more than one person for advice. The way it builds one character. Prepares them for the real world. It is always a good idea to get an outsiders opinion. Like my mom always says, ""It never hurts to ask for help.""   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

Phones help us in many ways when it comes to driving. They help navigate us in unknown areas, and it is a great form of contact in case of emergencies. Although it tends to be distracting, technology has advanced that we can have our eyes on the road while communicating with others.

Over the years technology has evolved rapidly so that it could make life easier for us, such as bluetooth. Bluetooth is a setting on a smart device like a phone, where you can connect wirelessly with another piece of hardware, like headphones. So, if someone tries to call you while driving, all you have to do is press the button on your headphones, and you will have the ability to call, or hang up the phone.

Phones can be a great use of navigation. With sources like Google maps, it has replaced all normal paper maps for when it's time to enter a new area. Not only were the original maps were a disturbance to drivers, but your phone can literally tell you how, when, and where to take you. Whether it is warning you about construction, or when to turn left or right, your phone is there to help for this uncanny situation.

Communication is very important in this day in age. So if you were scheduled for an appointment but you are late due to traffic or for an emergency situation, you can use your phone during that situation and explain why you need to reschedule. Not only that, but if you arrive at a destination, but having trouble finding a person you need to pick up, you can just give them a call, and tell them to start heading outside.

Texting while driving is a really problematic situation when it comes to acquiring a vehicle. It will lead you to bad injuries, or even death.

When faced with an important decision, it is wise to gather perspectives from different people. No single person can possibly have all the answers or consider every angle of a complex situation. Getting advice from multiple trusted sources helps you develop a more well-rounded understanding of your options and their potential consequences. 

For example, let's say a student is deciding whether to pursue music or science in college. They may talk to a parent, teacher, family friend, and older sibling. Each person likely has a different background and life experiences that shape their point of view. The parent may emphasize career stability and financial security, while the music teacher highlights the student's passion and talent. A science-minded family friend could discuss opportunities in fields like acoustical engineering. Hearing these varied perspectives exposes the student to angles they may not have considered alone. 

Seeking multiple opinions also protects against bias. Any one person may be inclined to push their own agenda or have a blind spot that skews their advice. But getting several perspectives helps balance out those individual biases or blind spots. The varied views can highlight objectively better choices rather than just reflecting what appeals most to a single adviser. No one adviser has a monopoly on truth or the full scope of considerations. 

Finally, mulling over different counsel expands one's thinking beyond initial impressions. What seemed like the obvious right answer from just one person's counsel may look more complex or uncertain when weighed against other rational considerations. The process of actively comparing disparate advice and forming one's own conclusion breeds stronger critical thinking skills. It empowers the person seeking counsel to make the choice most right for their own unique situation and priorities, not just someone else's perspective. 

In summary, making big decisions is challenging. Talking to more than one trusted source provides a well-rounded picture, protects against bias, and encourages independent thought - all of which can lead to choosing the option that truly is the best personal fit rather than just seeming best from a single limited viewpoint. Gathering multiple perspectives is wise advice indeed when making life's important choices.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,2
4D1755B1E482,"School brings unforgettable memories. To all students get good grades and have time for their selvesÂ is something students want through their life. Many students prefer to stay home and take their classes online. It can make a lot time for student to have for their selves. Also, can affect to learn an important skill in life such how to communicate and have friendships with other people. Although some may believe otherwise, have friends, clubs, and fun flip trips prove that students such consider to attend their school and not be home all the time.

Having friends can make a student learn from each other. For example, I was offeredÂ an option to attend classes from home, and through all my elementary school years I spent my time at home study. One day, I decided to have my classes in school with other students. I learned some many things that I have never thought of learning. I got to know new people beside my family. Making friends was of the best things, and I never realizes having friendships is to get to know each other. School is not only a place to learn, but making relationshipÂ with other people and learn have to communicated. Some people may believe that friendships can be unhealthy, cause bully, and depression to students. In the other hand, students such not isolated their selves from people, having a friend can make a big different in a students life, and learn how to communicated with one an others.

School have many clubs that student have created to help others. In my school, there are many clubs that help with collecting food, clothes, or supplies to give to the people that need it. Other clubs show new ways to make a better community and help the environment. Me, like a student participated in this activities is something very wonderful. This is a privilege of attend school with others student, we get to come out with ideas to make this world a better place to live. Some may disagree in this ideas, but have a places such like a clubs to get together, and shared opinions about how to make our life more activate in this world. Therefore, student are the future and getting to know each other it can make a different in society.

Get to go to school flip trips and explored new experiences. Almost every school had made a trip for students to have fun and learning something new. It could be a trip to a museum, a park, or historic places. In my life experience, this trips can be very fun. It's better being visiting a place than reading a textbook that related on the topic. Being home school may not give student to participated in this activities with other students. They probably have more time to get out and got to trips. Would this be fun for those student without having the opportunityÂ to spend time with other students, and make a memory that may stay for rest of their life. People would argued about this, but being studying with other students is way to built unforgettable memories. In other words, go in flip trip with other students and spend time together can make student life more happy.

In conclusion, one point in life we look back for those unforgettable memories, and we smile at the special moment, we had. Taking classes from home can be benefit for some students. In my opinion, I disagree in this position because student need to built up friendships, participated clubs, and go out in school flip trips. Spending time with one an others can help student to be better to communicated with others and be more confident to themselves. It get student to be ready to see the world at head of them.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
llama_70b_v1266,"Climate change has become a pressing issue that needs to be addressed immediately. The effects of climate change are already being felt, from rising sea levels to extreme weather events, and it's essential that governments take immediate action to mitigate its impacts. In this essay, I will argue for the idea that governments should take immediate action to address climate change, providing reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, climate change is a global problem that requires a global response. It's not just a matter of one country or region, but a collective responsibility of all nations to work together to address this issue. Governments have a critical role to play in this regard, as they have the power to implement policies and regulations that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. For instance, governments can impose carbon taxes, invest in renewable energy infrastructure, and promote sustainable practices in industries and agriculture.

Secondly, the consequences of climate change are already being felt, and it's essential that we take immediate action to prevent further damage. Rising sea levels are threatening coastal communities, extreme weather events like hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts are becoming more frequent and intense, and climate change is also affecting public health. For example, warmer temperatures are increasing the spread of diseases like malaria and dengue fever. By taking immediate action, governments can help mitigate these impacts and prevent them from getting worse.

Thirdly, addressing climate change can also have economic benefits. The transition to renewable energy sources can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth. In fact, a study by the International Renewable Energy Agency found that the renewable energy sector could support up to 24 million jobs worldwide by 2030. Moreover, investing in renewable energy can reduce dependence on fossil fuels, which can save countries billions of dollars in fuel costs. For instance, Costa Rica has been able to save over $500 million in fuel costs annually since 2015 by using renewable energy sources.

Furthermore, governments have a moral obligation to take immediate action on climate change. Climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable communities, including low-income families, indigenous populations, and small island nations. These communities have contributed the least to climate change but are bearing the brunt of its impacts. By taking immediate action, governments can help protect these communities and ensure that they have a safe and sustainable future.

Finally, delaying action on climate change is not an option. The longer we wait, the more severe and irreversible the impacts of climate change will be. We have already seen the devastating effects of climate change in recent years, from hurricanes in the Caribbean to wildfires in Australia. If we don't take immediate action, these impacts will only worsen, and future generations will bear the consequences of our inaction.

In conclusion, governments should take immediate action to address climate change. The consequences of climate change are already being felt, and it's essential that we take action to mitigate its impacts. Addressing climate change can also have economic benefits, and it's a moral obligation for governments to protect vulnerable communities. The time to act is now, and delaying action is not an option. We must work together to ensure a sustainable future for all.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The issue of climate change has become increasingly important in recent years.

b13c2e75,"Driving a car around can be very a affective aspect in people's lives it can also be a very stressful and dangerous liferisking task to do each and every day. All across America, citizens are constantly driving their cars. A car can be used to go to work, to the grocery store, or to drop a loved one off to school and even other places. It is to the point were a simple car has become an important necessity to manage everyday life. It is also to a point at which every year cars are responsible for thousands of deaths and accidents. If people around the world limited their car usage everyday it could significantly better our lives.

Clear the air. Pollution from cars has severely polluted the air we breathe and our environment. Beijing, China is know as one of the most polluted cities in the world and has been effected my the smog. Many places around the world are trying to make a difference in their environment by trying to get citizens in that area to limit their driving. According to an excerpt from ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Paris has enforced a parital driving ban to help clean the air of the global city. As stated in the excerpt, ""On Monday motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" Just because of that one action congestion in the capital of France was down 60 percent and as time goes by the air will start to clear up faster.

If one had the opportunity to take away stress while lower the air pollution, would the do it? In Bogota, Colombia once a year millions of Columbians take part in a day without cars know as carfree day. As stated the the article, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky the goal of the carfree day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Many citizens of Colombia take advantage of the day by hiking, biking, skating or taking buses to work, which benefits one's health and is a great source of excessive. Because of this day many parks and sports centers have opened, sidewalks have been replaced, and rushhour restrictions have created a better flow in traffic.

Putting away something you constantly use everyday can be a difficult thing to do but it is worth it in the end. Minimizing the use of cars can greatly reduce the amount of polluion of the air. If we all comply with is task year by year our air will get cleaner and the environment will be better.",0,train_essays,,3
FEFEDFE935D3,"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I am addressing you on the issue if all students at SCHOOL_NAME should be required to do community service. I believe that each student should need some community service hours. Each student should do something to benefit our community. At the same time they should not be required a ridiculous amount of hours if the student doesn't think they should do community service. My reasoning for this is this community gives there tax dollars for us to get the things we do at this school. The least we can do is give back by doing something like cleaning, daycare, tutoring, etc. When deciding on this issue students need to think about that. If it wasn't for our community we wouldn't be allowed to get the education that we are getting.

At the same time we do not need to have a surplus of hours put on a student to do. If passed a reasonable number of hours needs to be set. My reasoning for saying this is that if a student here wanted to do after school activates the community service does not need to interfere with things like sports and clubs. For example if I was on three teams witch I am and had to do twenty hours of community service, I would have a over planned schedule if I still planned on having exceptional grades So a student can be involved with those too witch I am a strong supporter of. This is my thoughts on this issue thank you for your time.

E06EDBA28C44,"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:

Hey, y'all! Today we're gonna talk about why it's important for humans to set their aims too high when they're trying to achieve their goals. Like, think about it, if you aim too low, you're only gonna get what you aimed for, but if you aim too high, you might get something way better!

First of all, let's talk about what happens when you aim too low. Like, if you want to get good grades in school, but you only aim for a C+, you might end up getting a C+, but that's it. You won't get any better than that. And that's not really worth it, right? You might as well aim for an A or a B, then you'll have a better chance of getting it.

But, on the other hand, when you aim too high, you might be surprised at how far you can go! Like, if you want to be a professional basketball player, but you aim for the NBA, you might not make it, but you might end up playing for a college team or even a minor league team. And that's still way better than if you had only aimed for the local rec league.

Another thing to consider is that when you aim too high, you're more likely to work harder and put in the effort to get there. Like, if you want to be a doctor, but you only aim for a job at the local hospital, you might not study as hard or put in as much effort as if you aimed for a top-tier medical school. And that's gonna make a big difference in the end!

So, in conclusion, setting your aims too high can lead to bigger and better things than if you aimed too low. And even if you don't reach your goal, you'll still end up farther ahead than if you had only aimed for something easy. So, go ahead and aim for the stars, y'all!

EE90061719C2,"Extracurricular activities, such as playing sports, instruments, and joining after school clubs are highly encouraged by adults and teachers for growing adolecents. Recently, the principal of the Generic_School stated all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe forcing students to join a club activity will be unnecessary, unproductive, and inefficient considering the cost and the effort. There is not enough data and evidence to ensure that all students will like their activities, it will create a fair cooperation and competition environment among diverse groups of students, and finally to prove that every student will enjoy extracurricular activities.

My first argument is that it will force students to participate in an activity that they might not enjoy which is unhealthy. My current school, Generic_School, does not have unlimited budget, faculty members, and space for different club activities. With very limited resources, the school will much prefer to establish more popular clubs than smaller clubs. Options that the school offer may not serve everyone's interest, but students will still need to choose an unappealing activity because it is mandotary. For example, when I was at a camp last summer, I was asked to choose five different activities. However, they did not offer all the courses I wanted and I ended up joining the swimming class which is my least favorite sport. From my own personal experience, I concern how some students might lose their interests or end up disliking their chosen clubs activities.

Secondly, the plan seems unfair for certain group of students and will develop an unhealthy competition environment. It will simply create a disparity betweeen students who can afford private lessons or tutorings to get better at the activity and those who cannot. For example, a clarinet player who receives private lessons and plays in a local band will be able to perform much harder music and eventually be placed in a more advanced band than his peers who cannot afford the cost. This allows an environment where certain group of students will continue to get better and others cannot. Not only will it pressure the students with unnecessary stress, but it will also burden their parents financially.

Lastly and most importantly, it does not necessary have to be an extracurricular activity as far as the students are passionate about the activity. For example, some people might be passionate about learning foreign languages and cultures or solving creative math problems which are not considered extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are meant to help students find their hobbies and interests. However, for students who already have hobbies that are not necessary defined as an extracurricular activity, such as reading books or writing creative stories, it is not right to force them to do something that they are not interested in when they have already found their interests. Everyone is born with different talent and interest. For instance, I enjoy public speaking and joined the Generic_School Debate team, whereas others might fear giving speechs in front of their classmates during civics class. Extracurricular activities may not be the best option for all students.

Although extracurricular activities are known to promote adolecents' overall well-being in general, there seems to be more disadvantages than benefits to this plan. Because the school board has limited resources to offer, it will be practically difficult to make extracurricular activities mandotary and ensure all students could benefit from this plan. We also cannot make sure that everyone will like the activities and create health and only necessary competition among the students. I value some benefits of this proposal but believe that it is more disadvantageous towards students and that is the reason why I disagree with this plan.Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
6046f42f,"With all this talk about greenhouse gasses, you think to yourself ""What can i do to change all of this?"". It's not as hard as you think. Some cities in foreign countries and this one are actually giving up their licence short term or long term so that the can walk, bike, carpool, or take public transportation rather than taking their own car. This is a great thing, especially with global warming and such. Some advantages of limiting car usage can be: a less stressful and safe life, a reduction in harmful gasses, and a healthier lifestyle.

When you walk around your town depending on the size of it you see a lot of cars. You have to walk around on the sidewalks and worry about the fact that a small mistake by a driver can end your life. But in a city that has no cars driving around, you don't have to worry about that at all. You can not worry about how much the gas prices are because you may be car pooling or taking the bus. In "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she asked a citizen on what she thought of the no car law, she said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" line 3, she saw how having no fastmoving hunks of metal can be a very stresses situation. A community that doesn't have this stress can worry about other things now.

It's often talked about in the news. Greenhouse gasses. Global warming. We hear about all the time and how it's affected by emissions of cars. How could we avoid it? Simple, we stop driving around so much. Cars in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and we in the United States make up 50 percent of it Elisabeth Rosenthal, line 5. It's especially bad in Paris, where the gasses are so bad that there was 5 days of smog, only rivaled by Beijing, China the most polluted city in the world Robert Duffer, line 14, which it's so bad in Beijing the citizens of the city have to wear masks covering their noses and mouths to protect themselves from the harmful gasses. It's horrible that people have to live in such horrible conditions.

If you gave up driving to everywhere you go, you wouldn't just help the world with greenhouse gasses, you'd also be helping yourself. People nowadays sit at home watching TV and snacking. But do you know how much walking and biking could do to help the health of people. This would be the case if there was a limitation on driving cars. Getting exersize is also a great stressreliever. Also it helps with the nasty smog that's been mentioned. People wouldn't be breathing in harmful gasses if there was a limitation or ban to car usage in most contries. Air pollution effects all of us as human beings.

Most of us can't think of a society without cars, but it's very possible. We can, however, make a society exactly like that to some extent. Running around screaming about global warming won't do much unless you take action. Not only will it help the Earth to have better air, it can help lead a more stressfree, safe life and a healthier one that'll only need you to walk or bike to some places.",0,train_essays,,1
7FED050A6D55,"Title: The Importance of Coding and Teamwork in Robotics

Introduction:
Hey there! As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write about my findings on the job of Robotics, specifically focusing on coding and building components of a robot. In this essay, I'll be discussing the purpose of coding and how it relates to the movement of a robot, as well as investigating how teams of people can work together to build robots and how it's different from individual work.

Purpose of Coding:
Coding is a crucial part of robotics because it allows us to give instructions to the robot on what it should do. Just like how we use instructions to make a cake or build a house, coding gives the robot specific commands to perform tasks. For example, if we want a robot to pick up a object and move it to a different location, we would write a code that tells the robot to do just that. Without coding, a robot would be like a machine without a brain, unable to perform any tasks.

Coding and Movement:
Coding and movement are closely related in robotics. The code tells the robot how to move, whether it's moving forward, backward, left, or right. The code also allows the robot to avoid obstacles and navigate through different environments. For instance, if we're building a robot to navigate through a maze, the code would tell the robot how to turn, stop, and move forward based on the obstacles it encounters.

Teamwork in Robotics:
Building robots isn't just about coding, it's also about working together as a team. When building a robot, multiple people are involved in different aspects of the project, such as designing, coding, and assembling. This allows for a diverse range of ideas and perspectives, which can lead to more creative and innovative solutions.

I think that all students should have to perform community service. Since it is an important part in life I believe that to graduate from high school community service should be performed. Weather this service is helping the elderly or just going around and picking up trash around your neighbor hood I find that is a good way to help your community.

I agree that all students should have to do community service. One reason I believe this is because it may simply be helping your neighbor hood look better so that you may get new neighbors, and maybe even new friends. Weather or not if you already have somebody doing this in your neighborhood you should still do to help him/her out. If you are busy with other activities such as football or soccer then you need to take the time during the weekend to go around helping your community.

Also you should do community service because it can help you make more friends. community service does this as you may not be the only Pearson in the community working to get a nicer neighbour hood. weather you are just trying to work on your neighbors house by painting it you can help your community's value grow.

Another way you cab help your community is by volunteering at an elementary school so that you could read them a story or tutor them in math. helping younger kids can help not just your community but your nation. This can help your nation as they may just be the one to find the cure for cancer.

So the next time you see a friend working for the community and your just sitting inside playing video games or watching television you should go out side and help them. And maybe they may just help you on something as well. Remember community service is always a great pass time.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

It has come to my attention that you are planning to change school policy that states that students may not participate in sports or activities unless they have a grade B average. I think that's really good idea, it'll motivate students to try harder. However I don't think this policy should go into affect because what if a student is trying their best in a class, but can't seem to earn a decent grade. What then? Or perhaps the student doesn't have a rather good home life, making it difficult for them to concentrate.

Some students find certain classes difficult. For example, Algebra. A student could try really hard to learn the material, but somehow they just don't understand it, causing them to get less than a grade B average. Or maybe it's not just one class the student is passing with a C. Maybe it's 5 out of 6 classes, maybe its all of them. I do not believe this should be held against a student if they are trying their best.

In addition, a student may have a horrid home life. This can affect their behavior in school by many ways. Namely, the student cannot focus in class, causing them to miss important information that will soon be very valuable. Or possibly, the student doesn't have time to complete their work or to study when they return home, because they are trying to support their family. There are so many reasons out there to explain someone's grade.

I am against this new policy, because a persons grade should not be held against them. A persons grade should be used to make out whether they are trying their best. And if you take away their activities or sports, you are causing them to lean in a total opposite direction -- mainly the wrong one, and that can damage the community -- making them to want to drop out of school or to just not care anymore.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
784baa05abd4_04112023,"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. While helping the community is undoubtedly a virtue, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach. There are better ways to encourage voluntary engagement.

Requiring community service risks fostering resentment instead of goodwill. When an activity is compulsory, it can feel more like a chore or burden than a chance to help others. Students may go through the motions without deriving personal meaning from the experience. Community organizations also deserve partners who wish to contribute freely of their own accord, not because they have to. 

Instead of a mandate, I believe cultivating a spirit of volunteerism through promotion and leadership by example would be more effective. Our school can highlight the many rewarding community service opportunities available and encourage students to find projects that fit their interests and strengths. Personal inspiration is stronger than external obligation. Clubs and activities related to service can pique curiosity and show how meaningful impact starts small. 

Leading by volunteering ourselves, teachers and administrators can demonstrate good citizenship in action. Seeing the difference made through patience and compassion will motivate more students to volunteer than a policy alone ever could. A culture of care for others blossoms naturally when nourished by commitment from within, not enforced from without.

While the intent is to strengthen our community, making service compulsory risks having the opposite effect. I ask that you reconsider moving forward with requirements and instead focus on inspiring voluntary participation through positivity, partnership and precedent. Our energy is best spent strengthening connections, not implementing rules. With compassion as our guide, I believe many students will choose to help for the right reasons.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

If you are constantly surrounded by negative people, it can be difficult to maintain a positive self-image. On the other hand, if you surround yourself with positive people, it can be much easier to feel good about yourself and your abilities.

One of the main benefits of having positive people around you is that they can help to boost your self-esteem. When you are around people who believe in you and support you, it can be much easier to feel confident and capable. These people can also help you to see your strengths and accomplishments in a positive light, which can be very motivating.

Another benefit of having positive people around you is that they can help to reduce stress and anxiety. When you are surrounded by negative people, it can be easy to feel stressed and anxious. This is because they may be critical or negative, which can make you feel like you are always under attack. On the other hand, when you are surrounded by positive people, they can help to reduce stress and anxiety by providing a supportive and positive environment.

However, even when you surround yourself with positive people, there may be times when you encounter negative people who want to change you. These people may try to make you feel like you are not good enough or that you need to change in some way. It is important to resist the temptation to let these people change you. Instead, you should focus on staying true to yourself and your values, and continue to surround yourself with positive people who support and believe in you.

In my own experience, I have found that having positive people around me has had a significant impact on my self-esteem. When I am surrounded by people who believe in me and support me, I feel much more confident and capable. I also find that I am less stressed and anxious, as I am able to focus on my strengths and accomplishments rather than being constantly criticized.

In conclusion, having positive people around you is incredibly important for your self-esteem. When you surround yourself with people who believe in you and support you, it can be much easier to feel confident and capable. It is also important to resist the temptation to let negative people change you, and instead focus on staying true to yourself and your values. By doing so, you",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,5
93B8C8DAFE20,"Doing projects at school is really fun when it comes to working in groups. I think working in a groups is more beneficial because of the extra help you'll have. You wont have to work a lot because your group will help and share the project so that everyone has a chance in it. Group projects will show you how to work with others and maybe even help you make new friends. Projects of any kind will look and be better when in groups, lots of ideas will be on the table for everyone to look and pick from.

Working at school is hard. You get lightheaded and maybe even get tired. Group projects are so helpful because the project will be split up into parts where everyone in your group can take a part of it, all they have to do is post it together when finished. Having not to do all of it by your self is super nice.

Another beneficial gift in working in groups is that you will be able to learn teamwork. Learning that is a good skill because you'll need teamwork for your life time. New people, classmates, workers, and much more will want to work with you because of how you and your team get along with one another.

Projects of all kinds have to look good. Lets say your having a hard time trying to find the perfect color background for your poster. You can talk to your classmates who are in your group and ask them if they have any ideas of what color you should pick. Together you can find the perfect color and together you can make your project look perfect and maybe be the one that has the best project in your who class.

Group working is so much better for everyone because you'll learn teamwork, learn that you'll always have help when you need it, and your projects will always look good and perfect.

F17F4DF6095D," In my opinion, honesty is the best policy in most situations. However, there are times when being truthful may hurt a person's feelings, and in those cases, being trustworthy may be more beneficial. Being trustworthy means being honest without lying to someone, which can help to maintain their trust and respect for you. On the other hand, lying to someone can cause more harm than good, as it can damage their trust and respect for you.

One of the main reasons why honesty is the best policy is that it helps to build trust and respect. When you are honest with someone, they know that they can rely on you to tell them the truth. This can help to establish a strong and healthy relationship with that person. Additionally, being honest can help to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts that may arise from lying or hiding the truth.

Another reason why honesty is the best policy is that it helps to avoid negative consequences. For example, if you lie to someone, they may lose trust in you and may no longer want to be friends or do business with you. Additionally, lying can lead to legal consequences, such as being charged with a crime or being sued. Being honest can help to avoid these negative consequences and can help to maintain a positive reputation.

However, there are times when being honest may hurt a person's feelings. For example, if you tell someone that they have done something wrong or that you do not like them, they may feel hurt or offended. In these cases, being trustworthy may be more beneficial, as it can help to maintain their trust and respect for you while still being honest about your feelings.

In conclusion, honesty is the best policy in most situations. However, there are times when being truthful may hurt a person's feelings, and in those cases, being trustworthy may be more beneficial. Being trustworthy means being honest without lying to someone, which can help to maintain their trust and respect for you.

llama_70b_v1958,"I think we should totally switch to renewable energy sources! Fossil fuels are bad for the earth and are running out anyway. My teacher told us that renewable energy is like a never-ending piggy bank, unlike fossil fuels which are finite. Plus, renewable energy is clean and doesn't pollute the air, which means we'll have cleaner air to breathe and a healthier planet.

I know some people might think it's too expensive, but in the long run, it'll be worth it. Just think about all the money we'll save on doctor bills from not getting sick from pollution! And it's not like we have to switch everything right now. We can start with small things like putting solar panels on our houses or using wind turbines to power our schools.

Also, did you know that renewable energy creates way more jobs than fossil fuels? Like, way more! My dad's friend works in the solar panel industry and he said they're always hiring. Plus, it's a really cool field to work in because you get to work outside and see the impact you're making on the environment.

I know some people might think we can't rely on renewable energy because it's not always sunny or windy, but technology is getting better and better. We can store the energy in batteries and use it when we need it. And besides, we can always use a combination of different renewable energy sources to make sure we have enough power.

llama_70b_v1274,"Homework has been a controversial topic among educators and students for a long time. While some people believe that homework is necessary for students to learn and succeed, others argue that it can be harmful and stressful for students. In my opinion, homework can be beneficial, but it should be used effectively and in moderation.

One of the main reasons why homework is important is that it helps students reinforce what they learned in class. When we practice something regularly, we are more likely to remember it and understand it better. Homework also helps students develop good study habits, such as time management and organization skills. For example, if a student is given a homework assignment to read a chapter in a textbook and answer questions, they will be more likely to remember the information and be prepared for a test.

Another reason why homework is beneficial is that it can help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Homework assignments often require students to apply what they learned in class to real-life situations. For instance, a math homework assignment might ask students to calculate the cost of groceries or measure the area of a room. These types of assignments help students see the relevance of what they are learning in school to their everyday lives.

However, I also believe that homework should be used in moderation. Too much homework can be overwhelming and stressful for students. It can take away from other important activities, such as extracurricular activities, family time, and personal interests. Excessive homework can also lead to burnout and decreased motivation for learning.

Furthermore, homework can be harmful if it is not used effectively. For example, if homework assignments are too difficult or unclear, students may become frustrated and lose confidence in their abilities. Similarly, if homework is used as a form of punishment or reward, it can send the wrong message to students. Homework should be used to support learning, not to control or manipulate students.

In conclusion, I believe that homework is an essential part of learning, but it should be used effectively and in moderation. Homework helps students reinforce what they learned in class, develop good study habits, and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. However, homework should not be used to the point of causing stress or burnout. Teachers and educators should strive to find a balance between giving students enough homework to support their learning and not overwhelming them with too much work.

E7EBDBDD703F,"Do curfews keep teenagers from getting into trouble? The city council is still currently debating on either adopting the curfew to be at 10 p. m. during the week days or at midnight on the weekends. If teenagers were to be out after the hours selected, it would be considered breaking the law. The laws are choosen for many reasons, even if we don't agree with most of them; we have to obey the laws. I believe the city council should adopt the cerfew for the minnors. When it comes to under age people in this world we have to be more conserned for their safety, it is best to have curfews. We should consider all the dangerous things going on in this world.

Have you considered all the things that could happen when your child is out? There is many dangerous things going on in this world. I'm not saying something will happen but honestly nowadays anything could happen. Without an adults care vision many things could occur. Many minnors are being killed or harmed for reasons we don't know. A curfew is one way from preventing those things from happening to your children. Even though a curfew at midnight on a weekend could still be dangerous; it is our responsability to teach the minnors from right to wrong. If we get them to understand why it is important to have a curfew they would be exrta careful. Theres a high possability they won't want to listen about their curfew; I can speak for myself I would want to spend more time with my friends there was a few times I didn't listen to my mom. I relized how much my safety ment to my mother and how worried she would be when i would be out late.

Have you heard about what happened to Generic_Name in New York? He was such a good child. His mother talk about how he loved hanging out with his nephews and family. She said he wouldn't go out with friends, he would always be home. He was very close to his sister, they'd always be together. Generic_Name had good grades in school, he would never get into trouble at all. The reason I bring his story life into this essay is because he was killed a few blocks away from is house, outside a little food market. I'm not so sure about the time but it was after dark. It was a group of guys who saw him, dragged him out the market and stabbed him under his arm. He tryed asking for help but no one would help him; he tryed getting to a hospital by foot unfortunaly Generic_Name didn't make it and died on the sidewalk. Those guy were caught a few months later and said they confused him with another guy. Generic_Name had no fault in any of it,he didn't deserve it. Maybe if he would of wanted for the next day or if his mom would of took him things could of happened diffrently. My point is leaving your house alone isn't so safe, when your with your parents it goes completey different.

Some people might think they would give the freedom they wanted as a child to there children. They might think there isn't a problem with them going out when ever they'd like and don't think they need a curfew. Everyone wants to enjoy their life and live it fully. Enjoying life doen't have to be passed your curfew, theres more to see during the day. Yes, you might trust your child so much you believe it's okay for them to leave but do you believe in the other people with your child being out in pulic? During day is much more safe then at night time when it's dark. One reason being is because of how many peolpe are out during the day. You could scream for help, run or give signs of being in danger. At night everyone is sleeping, and barely anyone is around.

In conclusion, the city council should think about the things going on in this world and do what's best for the teenagers, which is to have a curfew. Teenagers can still have their freedom and enjoy every bit of their lifes with curfews. I think it would be for the best; everyone would be safe in that way.

A92B9B2B7418,"Dear Principal,

If you were to change policies regarding participation in sports many students might not be able to play anymore. Numerous students enjoy playing sports for their school's teams. It is easy to maintain a C average and still play sports, that is what many students are doing now. I am sure that you and I would both want our students to play in our extra curricular activities. If you were to change the minimum grade average to a B that could lead to drug use to occupy their usual practice and game time, less scholarships for sports from our school, and fewer members from our school participating in sports and other activities.

My first reason of supporting no change in the grade average for sports is that without sports students may fall behind even more than they already are and go to drugs for something to do. If their practice and game time is not filled their last resort is going to be drugs and alcohol. This would not be good for our school and we want to keep our students as safe and healthy as we can, wouldn't you agree? Our students love playing these sports and i don't think we should take it away from them and replace it with drugs and bad grades.

Likewise, If our students who couldn't get the B average are out of sports, they won't be able to go to the college they deserve. Their skills would be hidden and colleges wouldn't give them a chance. Many students are given the opportunities of a life time because of the skills that they have in their sports and activities. Parents are also helped when their children play sports because they could get some sort of scholarship and that would help the family financially. If our students don't get into the good colleges, the colleges will see our school as a whole would as not so good and give students from other schools a better chance. Our school's won't get as good rates from colleges. Our reputation as a whole would be out into jeopardy.

In addition to drugs and less scholarships many students would be out off the team because of their grades. Our school's sports team will be beat, and we will be seen as the ""weak team- that anyone can beat"". For example there could be a student who is absolutely magnificent at football and he is the only star quarterback, but he can't keep a solid B average so he is kicked off the team and than we don't have a quarterback. I don't think you or I would want that for our school. I wouldn't want our school to be looked down upon like that.

In conclusion I think that the minimum grade average to be able to participate in sports should stay at a grade C average and not change to a B average. I think is should stay the same because students may be pulled into drugs easier, there will be less sports related scholarships from our school, and our sports teams will fall behind. We shouldn't pressure our students like this, because it isn't fair to them.

My principal has decided for all students would have to participate in one extrarricular activity. Say for example the student would have to go outside in have to play sport's. But they would go over the rules for every sport that they have out to play with. In for the year books you would be able to learn how to spell word's that you never new how to spell. The student's would also get a feel of how other student's our in they might even make a new freind's.

I agree because I think student's do not get enough exercise. If student's got enough exercise it would be more athleyt's. It would be more student's outside playing all types of sport's. They would be able to breath better than other poeple that do not like to exercise. In if student's do not get enough exercise they would not be able to leave a nice long life.

I think it is good for student's to exercise if all student's exercise they would leave a long healthy life. In if you leave a long life you be able to see the world in travel. But if you do not want to take care of your body you would not leave a long nice life. Like for example you would have to go threw alot to try to leave a healthy life. But if you do you would be able to complete your life long dream.

For the year books you would have to type poeple names. In the rason I think that is good is because the student's can get to laern new student's. The student's that our working on the year books can learn how too spell word's that they never even seen before. But you never know the student's can think the person that they saw in the year book is cool in want to be there freind.

People might think that they should chose witch extracurricular activity they could do and ,not one given to them by force. But some also might say that its great practice for the real world and, we should get used to it. Not only that we should also be prepared for extra work in some jobs but we also need to be more active. Why do we have to do one not by choice but rather by someone else.

Why do we go to after school classes because you might be struggling in classes or its a after school club. For the after school clubs we might need help with English or, help with math but the extra activities might make you struggle more from less time to do homework or study for tests. For instance when you have a sol you need to study and prepare for that but if you have a extracurricular activity you will have to do that first and then study it doesn't seem like a good way to prep students for a huge test. Not only that if they choose to add more time for these activities then it would be easy for after school clubs but students will hate it.

Adding more time to school will make most people unhappy and maybe even stressed out from too much work. Whenever more time is added to school it means more classes and usually its more than just one class being added its most likely two or three maybe more. When people find out there is more time in school they will try to change it to less time in school because people hate change. Not only that people hate more time they will not get more time for lunch and lunch is important if you dont have food then you will starve or you will be super sluggish. But also you have no choice for the activity you have been given to you.

You might be struggling in public speaking but you were given work with people in drama and try to go over the script for the next play. This is why there needs to be choice in the matter of activities you are apart in. Someone also might want a specific job but might have a skill that has no indicators that it can work with that job you want. So it's a draw from the hat situation basically and if your unlucky enough you will get something other than you wanted.

Everything comes down to what do you like not what the person that makes the rules thats their opinionÂ and you dont have to like it. Adding more time just makes the days longer and tougher but one day everyone will get usedÂ to it.

A20205E47409,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Instead of eliminating the use of cell phones at school, I think you should enforce Policy 1 and make a few adjustments. If you we're too allow students too use they're cell phones during lunch and the time they spend in the hallway it would not be only good for the students, it'd be good for you as well. One way it'd be good for you is, their would be less parents coming in and getting students cell phones that have been taken away because they didn't have any free time too text.

I know your thinking ""The students will still text when they aren't supposed to."" well that's were we make the adjustments. Considering students love to text, their will be some students who will take it upon themselves too text during class even though they just had a break to use their phones. So teachers should enforce them too turn them off and put them away. If they ignore that rule then they should get a warning the first time, a cell phone break suspension the second, then loose the privilege too text at school the third time for that quarter.

I think this method would work. As a student I like to text and if I had the opportunity to do it at school without getting in trouble I would take it. Also if a student gets a discipline referral for a different offense they should get their texting rights suspended, Then students would purposely behave so they can keep their phone break.

If you chose Policy 2 then more students will text in class, get their phones taken away and you will get many visits from parents. So why not do it the easy way, let students use their phones during their free time and if they disobey then take that privilege away from them. As easy as that, good behavior deserves a reward doesn't it? So I would appreciate it if you considered trying it out if you don't like it change I respect your discio

6A47B80F3283," In my opinion, distance learning is a great option for students who want to pursue higher education but face challenges such as lack of time or family responsibilities.

For many people, completing their education is a priority, but they may not have the time or resources to attend traditional classes. Distance learning allows these students to work and take care of their families while still pursuing their education.

Some students may also find it difficult to attend classes on-campus due to family responsibilities. Distance learning allows these students to take classes from the comfort of their own home and still be able to spend time with their families.

In addition, distance learning can be a more convenient option for students who live far from a traditional campus. They can take classes from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easier to fit education into their busy schedules.

Another benefit of distance learning is that it can be more affordable than traditional classes. With distance learning, students can work while they study, which can help them pay for their education.

Overall, distance learning is a great option for students who want to pursue higher education but face challenges such as lack of time or family responsibilities. It allows these students to work and take care of their families while still pursuing their education, and it can be more convenient and affordable than traditional classes.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

Dear students of Generic_School , I think that the our principal Mr. Generic_Name should be enforcing that we participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity this year.

Participating in something that is fun and can help you with your everyday day to day life , we should strive to want . For example , there are people in Asia , Africa , and India that are not able to go to school and would die if they were able to do the fun things that we get to do , that is why we should want to participate in fun things that can benefit you and your community .

My pawpaw once said that , "" If a opertuntity is thrown at you catch that opertunuty and create new and better opertunitys , and we should be doing just that . People are getting mad at Mr. Generic_Name and are leaving rude messages to the school saying , ""my kid should not have to participate if they dont want to"" , but what they dont see is that Mr. Generic_Name is creating new opertuntiy for you and setting you up for life . participating in activities with the school is helping everybody out weather they see it or not , we are learning new things that will stick with you forever.

When I was in 6th grade at Generic_School ,I joined FFA and I was staying after one Friday were I met a girl named Generic_Name , she let me come into her group and be one of there friends and now we all are super close. That is why participating in activities at your school can be beneficial to you and other people around you . Doing things with your school can help everybody out . For instance look at me and that group of girls I met staying after school 2 years ago , we are all great friends and hang out all the time and if it was not for the school having activities who know the friend I would have .

Participating can play a key roll in your life and can make you and shape you into a better person . If you thought before that you should not partiipate and that paticiapting in activitys were boring , I hope you change your mind and go about the new changes with a positvie aditude .

D28B89FAFE9E,"In the United States children must attend school by law. Traditionally school has been a place that students must physically go to. In recent years, new technology, like the internet and video conferencing, has changed education and school systems. Today some schools allow students to attend classesÂ online instead of physically being in the classroom. Students would not benefit from attending classes from home because they would not learn vital social skills, bulling would increase, and they would not get to experience school.

Students would lack critical social skills by attending class from home. School is a place where students learn but also socialize with their peers. Through this socialization students are taught what is socially acceptableÂ to do in public, how to read people, and how to carry a face to face conversation. Students that only communicate online or over video miss out on learning these skills. When talking through text messages, the meaning of the message can be misinterpreted. In face to face conversations it is easy to understand the meaning of a message by looking at the person's facial expressions and body language. For example, if someone said, ""I'm dying"" over a text message it would be interpreted that they were actually dying. However, this person most likely meant it as an expression and if they had said it in person it would have been interpreted as a joke by looking at their upbeat facial expression. By attending school online and not physically interacting with people, students miss out on learning social skills that are needed in everyday life as well as the workplace. Due to students lacking social skills they are more likely to hurt someones feelings which could turn into bullying.

By attending classes from home, students would face an increase in bullying because it is easy to hide behind a screen. In recent years there has been an increase in bullying though social media. This is because people don't have to face the consequences of their actions or words because they are protected by a screen and user name. Students brains' are not fully developed yet and they often don't understand how hurtful words can be. By not physically seeing the impact their remarks make on someone, students are more likely to say hurtful things that they would not say to someone in person. An example of this that occurs everyday is when people comment mean things on a picture someone else posts. The people that post these mean comments would never say these things out loud or to that person face to face. This is because they would have to have confidence and face potentially retaliation. By saying it online a person can hide behind a persona and user nameÂ and never know how that person was impacted by their words. Communicating and interacting through a screen can not only hurt others but cause students to miss out on important experiences.

Students would miss out on experiencing school by attending classes from home. Many people say that high school is the best time of your life. Students would not get to experience attending pep rallies, hanging out with friends between classes, and being apart of a community. School is a place for students to discover who they are and try new things. By attending classes online students would not get to experience these things. Viewing things through a screen is not a way to live life. If students don't experience classic school things, they miss out on a whole aspect of life. Watching a video of something happening is not as moving or memorable as experiencing it yourself. You wouldn't feel the nervous energy of a class before a test or the sense of belonging you get when the whole school sings the school's fight song at a pep rally. By attending classes online students would miss out on many experiences that they don't get later on in life.

Some people may say that students would benefit from attending classes from home because it would be more accessible. However, this is not necessarily true because not everyone has access to internet at their house. Students that do not have a computer or internet access will suffer and be at a disadvantage because they would not be able to access their education. Attending classes from home would not benefit students because they would not know social skills, would face more bullying, and miss the experience of going to school.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
9C601D9FCB5F,"Technology is an important thing in our lives at this moment and it will be more important in the future. Humanity always try to look forward for what is better for our lives and make everything more easier. While some people say this is a good thing, some people think it's bad for our lives because people stop interacting face-to-face in public, they don't want to get out of the place where technology is at, and some might have an agressive behaivor when they told them technology is bad for them.

In the past people always met in the street, there was no technology were with a single ring we can saw our friends into a little screen and talk to them. Now, this problem became a bad thing in our society, people don't go outside to meet friends, or just enjoy how the city looks, they prefer to stay at home and talk to people that they don't know who they are. Some of these people might say that there's no difference when they talk to a stranger online because we used to talk strangers in the street;however, there's a risk when you talk to this people online and it's the fact that some of them used fake accounts to hack personal information and other things. When we used to meet strangers in the street, we saw how they behave and what they're doing, and that's how people made friends in the past, saw how they act and behave,but now Internet is the key of making a friend that we don't know if it's real.

When we were kids it was all fun to play outside: in the streets,going to a friends house, or even going to the park with them, but now things have change a lot since we were those kids who played in the streets. Now with the new technology people made video games, and now is the popular thing between kids and teenagers. All we have to do is to connect the device to the TV and just play, but some people play the whole day and they don't want to go outside to play any sport, or going to a friends house. When they go to school the most common topic between every kid is about video games, and that can affect their lives because playing all the time won't help anyone to study for an important test,or doing their homework. In the past when they created the first console it was a wonderful thing, but some kids didn't have the enough money to buy it, so instead of save money for a tiny console, they save money to eat something like an ice cream, a burguer, and go to attraction parks,but now we can see how the kids and the teenagers from now don't want to get out where technology is at.

Due to the amount of technology we have now develop, a new behaivor where if we prohibited them to use technology, they reach to the point where they become agressive. Families have issues when their kids became agressive just because the prohibited the use of technology, and this reaction is trendy right now in different parts of the world. Some doctors said that the reason why they react like that is because they are in an imaginary world where they can do whatever they want, until the parent try to take apart their""world"" to become a normal kid, but now that technology is in every single corner, it's hard to make a kid stop use technology. Even teenagers went to a ponit when they are playing video games they break everything they got on their sight, including the video game device that their parents bought for them.

Some people might say that technology is something positive in our live because we create artifacts that make our lives more simple;however, technology is bad in our lives because we stop acting like normal people and we want to make our lives more easy, and that can affect how our saciety can be in the future if we don't control the use of technology.",0,original_moth,"Task:

llama_70b_v1806,"I think we should totes switch to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. First off, fossil fuels are bad for the environment and are running out anyway. They pollute the air and water, and they're a major contributor to climate change. Have you seen those pictures of the Great Barrier Reef? It's like, totally bleached and dying. We need to do something about it before it's too late.

Plus, renewable energy is getting cheaper and more efficient all the time. Like, my dad put solar panels on our roof and now we're saving like, a bunch of money on our electricity bill. And the technology is only getting better. I heard that some countries are already using like, 100% renewable energy. That's dope.

But like, even if you don't care about the environment (which you should), switching to renewable energy is just a smart move. Fossil fuels are finite, which means they'll run out eventually. And when they do, we'll be like, totally screwed. But renewable energy is sustainable, meaning it'll never run out. It's like, a no-brainer.

Plus, it'll create jobs and stimulate the economy. Like, my friend's dad started a solar panel installation business and he's making bank. And it's not just solar panels, there's like, wind turbines and hydroelectric power too. It's a whole new industry just waiting to be tapped.

I know some people might be like, ""But what about when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow?"" And I'm like, ""Uh, have you heard of batteries?"" We can store excess energy in batteries and use it when we need it. It's not that hard.

So yeah, we should totes switch to renewable energy. It's good for the planet, it's sustainable, it'll create jobs, and it's just the smart thing to do. Let's do it.

ADFF10967768,"When new technology comes out it can always be a positive thing. That its better to have something than not to have it. having a computer that can determine if we are sad, happy, bored, etc. is pretty crazy. without this technology we probably wouldnt be able to determine that the Mona Lisa is prodomitly happy. That a computer can do something that humans do everyday when we look at someone.

That having the ability of computers that can read students faces, in my opinion is valuable and can be used in many ways.

There are many ways that the computer can be used, if someone were to put the computer in a everyday public school classroom. They can detect and figure out what learning style kids like. this can be implimented and put to use in classrooms around the world and help get kids more into school and want to try to get an education. This can make school more fun and more intresting for kids today. differetn classrooms can have different styles and you have a variety of kids per classroom and test to see what style the kids like. when the results come back teachers and staff can go over them and the more majority of kids that like a certian teaching style can be the style that is implimeanted in the schools today This is all done by seeing what facial emotions are used by the kids.

Another way that the ability of reading students emotions can help, is to have the ability detect how students are feeling and even when they are trying to hide how they are feeling. When you are a teenager you have lots of crazy and mixed feelings. Sometimes a student might go into a deep depression and his or her friends might not be able to detect the the fact of what they are feeling and they might do something to themselves that might not be a good thing. If you use this device and cna detect how they are feeling you could stop that student from harming his or her self from doing this. This can save lots of lives and stop death rates all around the world and help that student to get help and stop this from happening. This is all done from a technology that can read facial emotions and can be very useful and even save ones life.

Having this technology can be nice, but sometimes it cant always be right. If we use this technology it doesnt always mean that it can be helpful or can detect what really kids are thinking. Sometimes you can put on a brave face and show the world what really inside thats not what you are thinking. The computer migh pick up the brave face you are showing and say that you are happy but really you are having a bad day and you really arent happy. When you use this technology for schools and the computer detects the faces wrong then you have spent all of this money to have the computers detect how the faces of the kids are showing and the results really arent true then you have just wasted lots of time and that is not necessary to have. We dont really know what people are feeling. Mona lisa may not be 83 percent happy and 9 percent disgusted, etc. She may be 10 percent happy and 90 percent digusted, etc. there no good way to determine what she was really feeling at that time and in that picture.

Having the technology to read students emotional expressions can be helpful, but it determines how you use it and how you correct the results are. But having this technology isnt a bad thing. Its a way to determine what people are thinking without asking the person or being in that persons head. But with having technology that is able to read students faces and emotional expressions can be used and if used carefuly can help schools and other people today.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Being at home makes the job a lot easier, there's less distractions, you'll focus more and be more of at peace. Knowing that you can sit around all day in your bed instead of being in a office is something that most people would love to do. Being at home can cause a lot of distractions. It will have you wanting to do everything throughout the day except for the work that is needed to be done.

The work that needs to be done can be done on your own time but sometimes its best to get it down earlier because you could end up forgetting about it but, there's no rush for you to finish .

Working at home is a lot more safe and sanitary. It's not going to be a lot of stuff that needs to be wiped down that other people touch on the daily. There is less germs that will be resurfacing back on to you. Working at the office can cause you less trouble with your safety because the janitor wipes down everything with bleach and other cleaning supplies.

While at the building you should wash your hands as many times as possible and always have some hand sanitizer with you, so you could also use the sleeve of your shirts to open any doors. Those are some small things you can do to keep from getting sick.

AA0FF7AA95C3,"Dear  State Senator, 1/23/15

I have a very strongly worded, persuavive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways president's become elected, but it's serving an unjustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College.I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished.

My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in.  What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, ""Most states have a

""winner- take all"" system that awards electors to the winning presidential canididate."" The winner- take all system is not a fair way to elect a president becuase of its biases. The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largly populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to Californa or Texas becuase those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campiagn for a certain candidates . According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campiagn ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No reigon has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candiadtes focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College.

My second reason of why our country must abolish the Electoral College is becuase it is a ""disaster factor"", as stated by Source 2. I agree with this for two reasons. First, becuase it does allow the people to vote for the president or canididate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong"". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is becuase most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More presiciely 60 percent of voters to dont want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it?

In conculsion, ""It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality"", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a ""Disaster Factor"" or  causes many disruptions in our country.

Sincerly, a very patriotic citizen,

BE1B8DAE1D75," Is finishing high school in three years a better idea than the traditional four years? This is a question that has been debated by students, parents, and educators alike. While finishing high school early can be a good idea for some students, it may not be the best choice for everyone.

One of the main advantages of finishing high school early is that it allows students to start thinking about their future earlier. This can be particularly beneficial for students who are unsure about what they want to do after high school. By finishing early, students can take the time to reflect on their goals and aspirations, and make informed decisions about their next steps.

Additionally, finishing high school early can help students to mature faster and make more responsible decisions. This can be particularly important for students who may not have had as much life experience as their peers. By finishing early, students can gain a better understanding of the real world and develop the skills they need to succeed in the future.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to finishing high school early. For example, students may not have had enough time to take all of the classes they need to be fully prepared for their future. This could lead to difficulties in college or in the workforce. Additionally, students who finish early may feel pressure to make decisions about their future too quickly, which could lead to regret or uncertainty.

Ultimately, the decision to finish high school early or not is a personal one. It's important for students to carefully consider their options and weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks before making a decision. If finishing early is the right choice for a student, it can be a great opportunity to start living their own life one year earlier than their peers. However, if it's not the right choice, it's important for students to continue with the traditional four years of high school and take the time to fully prepare for their future.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

I have been a member of a chorus and played in a band, which has allowed me to develop my musical skills and express my creativity through music.

One of the instruments I have enjoyed playing the most is the recorder. It is a versatile instrument that can be played in a variety of genres, from classical to jazz to pop. I have practiced playing the recorder for several years, and I have even participated in competitions and concerts featuring the instrument.

In addition to the recorder, I have also practiced and played the xylophone, percussion, and violin. Each of these instruments has its own unique characteristics and challenges, but I have found them all to be rewarding and enjoyable to play.

AAF42F8A396F," I agree with the statement that first impressions are hard to change. When you meet someone for the first time, you are often judged based on your appearance, behavior, and actions. If you make a negative impression, it can be challenging to change people's perceptions of you, even if you try to change your behavior or actions.

For example, if you're at a job interview and you don't make a good first impression, it can be challenging to turn things around. Even if you have the qualifications and experience for the job, people may still have a negative impression of you, which can make it harder to get hired. Similarly, if you move to a new place and try to make new friends, but you make a bad first impression, it can be challenging to change people's perceptions of you.

In addition, if you have a bad first impression, it can also impact your social life. For example, if you're in a sport team and you always brag about how good you are, people around you may not want to be around you. They may spread rumors about you, and people may stop talking to you. Similarly, if you ask out someone you like, but they have a bad impression of you, they may not even want to talk to you.

However, it's important to note that not all first impressions are accurate. Sometimes, people may judge you based on your appearance or behavior without getting to know you as a person. In these cases, it may be possible to change people's perceptions of you by showing them a different side of yourself.

In conclusion, while first impressions can be hard to change, it's important to make a good first impression because it can help you in various aspects of your life. Whether it's in your personal or professional life, having a good first impression can make a big difference in how people perceive you.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

So which ever canidate wins the popular vote in Florida, receives twenty-nine electoral votes. The popular vote method would take longer, because more votes would have to be counted and added, but I truely beleive it would be more effective.

In 2012, Obama received 61.7% of electoral votes but only 51.3% of popular. Either way he would have won, but the popular vote is more of what the actual citezens want. in 2000, Al Gore dominated the individual popular vote, but when the electoral votes were counted, Gore came up short with 266, wheras Bush had 271. So you can see that if the popular vote was what counted (as it should be), Gore would have won the election.

During the election campaign, some states may not even see the canidates. For example in the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates. The reason behind this is because of ""swing states"". Canidates don't want to waste time in states that they have no chance of winning. Instead, they focus only on the tight runs in the ""swing states"". Voters in twenty-five of the largest media markets didn't see the first campaign ad during the whole election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is over-rated, and somewhat inaccurate. The reason I say that it is somewhat inaccurate, is because the people are voting for the presidential canidate that they want to have in office. Instead, they are actually voting for votes. Sounds a little weird but it is true. In reality, the popular vote makes little difference, and that should change.       Â     Â     ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
aa0b24ef,"Dear Florida Senator, There has been much controversy over whether or not we should keep the Electoral College or have it removed and vote on the president based on popular vote. I believe the best decision is to change to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. If the system would change, people would feel like their votes actually matter more then they do now. They wouldn't have to worry about the electors flipping sides. Some people though, do say that the way the election is now is completely fair in the case of votes are based on population.

To begin with, if the Electoral College was to be taken out of use, more people would feel like their vote matters. Although you may think you are voting for your choice of president, you are not. As of now, when you cast your vote, you are actually just voting for your candidate's electors, as said in ""What Is the Electoral College"". In the 2000 campaign, voters in seventeen states didn't have a chance to see the candidates at all. Those candidates went mainly to the ""swing"" states, or states that were not certain on who they would be voting for. The states unvisited, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina, were passed over because the candidates knew they would or wouldn't have their vote no matter what. The ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance to see either candidate in their state. In, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", the rodney and Obama election is mentioned. It brings up the fact that rodney knew that throughout the South, he was going to get their vote. He realized that there was no need to go there because he didn't need anymore popularity in the South because he had already gained their electoral votes. Those who opposed rodney in the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for rodney. If the system were to change, which I believe it should, more people would feel their votes mattered no matter what state they were in.

In addition to feeling like your vote matters, people never know if the electors would flip their desicions. The slate of electors is not picked by the people. It is said in, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid jdefenses of the system are wrong"", that sometimes the state conventions, the party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors. That being said, you don't know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not. For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party's candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen. A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now. This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes. You can see that the current system has its flaws.

Many people say that it is fair for all states because of their amount of electoral votes. For example, in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", Florida, which has a much larger population than Wyoming, recieved 29 electoral votes for Obama while Wyoming only had 3 electoral votes. This, at the same time though, makes candidates want to only go to the larger states to try to get their votes. The smaller states once again feel left out and unappreciated.

In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote. Above all, it is more fair to the people. Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now. People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for. Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College. I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College. All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree.",0,train_essays,,5
8C0D50387A60,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because some people are comfortable where they are. It is alway good to go beyond your comfort zone and explore new thing. Without explore you will never know what you are cable of and you will never grow in life. It good to be satify where you are sometime, But when emergency come to need to explore to see who you truly are. He is also right because where Iam from lot of people are satify where they in life life.

I believe that the more you explore the more you grow. For example If Bill Gate was satify what he master with out exploring he would had never become a billionaire and he would never discovered the microsoft. And if

Barack Obama was satify with his education/knowledge he would never had became a Senator or the first Black

African American president of America and he was never going to be able to share is idea with America .So with out going beyond what you have mastered you will never know who you are and what you are cable of. Explore beyond what you have mastered and there will alway be a suprise , a new talent and a new growth in life. You will never discovered your worth/talent with out trying. Some people have that mind set that if they explore they will never make it. The more you explore the farther you go in life. Always pray to advanced to a new level not the level you have master. My mom alway tell me never be happy where you at step out of your comfort zone and explored.

So you will know who you truly are. For example if your boss is leave and they are looking for a new replacement for his/her position and you have knowledge/idea about the job, but you decided embrace where you are because you are scared to take a step in life. And you also have the mind set that they will turn you down. Some people in college are comfortable having there master degree but scared to get their doctorate degree because they feel that having their masters degree is the stopping point of their learning skills and they are not smart enough to get their doctorare degree. Some enviroment make you satify where you at.

Being happy with where you at is not a bad thing but the more you explored the more you grow in life. Never be happy with who you are alway fight for a better future on a better life. like Neil Armstrong Said "" a gaint leap for man kind"" some people need to take that gaint leap in their life.

4216AC2DDEC4,"Most schools around the globe offer normal school, this is when a student goes to a class or classes to be taught. There is also online school which allows for students to get the same education at home over a computer or other device. The three reasons why online school is more beneficial to students are: it makes for a less stressful environment, students are responsible for his or her own work and grades, and allows students to have a more flexible schedule.

When a student goes to school they are taken out of their ""safety bubble"" and this can cause certain people to be more stressed. Most of the time stress can be good for a person. It helps keep a person awake and focus, it can cause a person to improve, among other things, but too much can be detrimental to a persons health, and cause thatÂ person to make mistakes.

In school some teachers have students work together on an assignment. This can cause problems because some students leave all the work to others causing the other students to have to do more work which may cause the overall grade to drop.

Students that have to go to normal school have to spend more than eight hours a day to go to school, finish school, and then do homework after they get home. this takes up more than half the day not leaving much time for anything else. If a student takes online school they can work at their own pace allowing them more time on what they need help with and less time on what they do not need help with.

Due to online school offering a less stress filled environment, students are responsible for his or her own work and grades, and allow students to have a more flexible schedule, show that the pros of online school outweighÂ the cons of online school.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
FAB4AD7890A9,"In the year 2032, and a new product is talked about all around the world: in homes, buisnesses, schools, and churches. For several days, many people gabble about the aspects of a car that drives itself and is safer than most cars with excitement and jauntiness.

For many people, this anecdote is the ideal future and one that will hopefully happen soon. Development of automated cars should be funded and researched more thoroughly because automated cars make roads safer, are more luxurious for the passenger, and are not completly driverless.

In ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", the author states ""Google has had cars tha could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash"". Because of this fact, cars are safer. Automated cars have radars, and sensors all around them to know where the cars are at any given time. this includes the LIDAR which creates a 3D model of its surroundings, making the entire experience safer and causing less deaths each year. in 2013, BMW developed a car which can go up to twenty five miles per hour if the driver keeps his or her hands on the steering wheel, adding to the safety features on these new cars.

Another reason why these cars are fundable and should be reashered more is the fact that the new car rides would be more fun for the passengers. For example, these cars would have displays that let people watch movies and play video games. The moniters turn off when danger is afoot, which adds to the safety features on the new automated car.

For people who are still worried that the cars will be unsafe because a computer can't decide what a human can and can't perform complex actions, do not fear. Automated cars will not be devoid of human interaction. According to paragraph seven of ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are deesigned to notify the river when the road ahead requires human skills.""

The new cars have also been designed to warn passengers to oncoming dangers by vibrating, speaking, or flashing lights when danger in near by. GM has developed a car which vibrates a driver's seat if his or her car is going to his an object behind them. This creates a car to human relationship that insures cars on the road are safer and cause less deaths per year.

In conlusion, automated cars are the future. They are safer, more relaxing, and are not completely automated. The future is looking bright for thse new cars. People should expect new and exciting cars to not drive in the near future.             ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

D9B80F897473," The best way to positively influence others to exhibit good behavior is to be a compassionate friend.

Providing guidance and attempting to communicate with them is essential, as sometimes individuals may face difficulties at home that affect their behavior. For instance, if I notice a friend or someone close to me exhibiting negative behavior, I would try to be kind, empathetic, and offer a new perspective to help them improve.

Being a positive influence is crucial in all aspects of life. It is a friendly and approachable individual who provides a positive outlook on situations. In contrast, negative influences are those who take advantage of opportunities without considering the consequences, leading to a lack of concern for others.

The type of friends one has and the way parents are educated can significantly impact a person's behavior. For example, individuals with bad behavior may have negative influences who encourage them to engage in destructive behaviors. However, having positive influences can help individuals develop a social life, friendly demeanor, and a kind personality.

It is essential to recognize that not all friends will always be there for you during challenging times. True friends, on the other hand, are those who are always willing to help and offer guidance when needed. It is crucial to distinguish between real friends and fake friends who may not be there for you when you need them the most.

A5DB60716E91,"Dear Senator,

I respect and admire your position in office for you are always on your toes and doing work for your people. But one thing I do not admire as a citizen of the U.S., is the Electoral College in which our country goes by. When saying Electoral College I am meaning the process in which the election of the President by a vote is compromised with a popular vote of qualified citizens. By changing to a popular vote, everyone is equal and our location won't restrain us from our vote that we cast. The Electoral College may have suited our countries needs in the past but it is now time to abolish this unequal process.

To get things going, the Electoral College strays to many voters away. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", Plumer brought to my attention that many voters are aware that the canidate that they want to serve as president does not stand a chance in their state and because of this they do away with voting. Personally, I feel that voting should be something that everyone partakes in. After all, if you didn't vote you shouldn't complain. But in the boat we are in now, we (US Citizens) are being taken advantage of and are rights are simply stripped away in this form of voting. In fact, one-half on eligible American voters did not vote in 2012 and I am sure the voting process we use has a storng influence on these people. If we were to vote, in some cases they won't even matter. This lets our location define us and not our beliefs.

This leads to the next point that it gives too much power to those we elected. Yes, we did elect them and we should have faith in them, but the Electoral College makes it very difficult to do. ""What Is the Electoral College?"" brought it to my attention that the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. So we simply place our votes in the hands of the minimal amount of people. I don't think so!

Lastly, did those serving in office think about the people at the bottom of the todem pole (average US citizens) rather than those at the top (serving in office)? ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" states ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Because of this, it becomes clear that my opinions and rights are stripped away. It completely disgusts me at the fact our nation is treating our citizens in this manner. It is time for those in office to think about who they are serving. Fifty-five people shouldn't represent 500,000. We should all be able to cast votes equally with the same credentials.

All in all, there are in fact some limited benefits of an Electoral College, but a direct election or popular vote would suit our nation much better based on our needs in the present. Through Electoral College it is much easier to recognize who won the election and a few more advantages, but it has become very outdated and unequal. It is time for change and we must act now!

Venus the second planet close to the sun is a very dangerous planet to get close to. it is sometimes called the earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth too.

I believe that we should'ntÂ be forced to do extracurricular activity because you might be tired after school, have to work, or help around the house after school.

My first reason is, maybe your tired after school. all of us has been tired at least once after schoolÂ and wanted to sleep for a bit instead of doing your homework right away or maybe you were possibly hungry. Maybe you were sleepy and wanted to sleep for 30 minutes and then grab something to eat after you woke up from your nap.

Maybe you wanted to eat something because you haven't ate all day and its better to relax your mind instead of going right into work after school.

My second reason, is that maybe your old enough to work and have a after schoolÂ job you work at for a couple of hours. You might have a job and have to work right after school and you dont come home until dark and its hard for you to do anything else after you get off work because you have to do your homework and then head to bed for the next day of school. Another thing is that maybe your scheduleÂ will be ruined if you have to do an extracurricular activity after schoolÂ cause of the time and the time you might have to work, can interfere with your time schedule.

The last and final reason, is that you have to watch over your siblings after schoolÂ or pet sit your neighbors dogs and walk and feed them. Sometimes, you have to watch your younger brothers or sisters and you are busy most of the time to get anything else done. The other thing is that if your parents dont come home until late you might also have to clean the house and do other things such as wash the plates, throw the trash out and many more.

Which brings me to my conclusion, we shouldnt have to do an extracurricular activitiesÂ because you might be tired or you have to work and or take care of the house, So in my opinion I don't think we should have to do anything extra after schoolÂ instead take the rest of the day off.Â    Â  Â  Â    Â  Â  Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
46DC70997CEB,"Some schools are given summer project to assure students continue learning throughout the summer. Since, the summer project is completed over the summer I believe it should be student-designed. First reason being is cause students should be able to make the project as they please as this embraces their imagination as to how they would like it to be and not just lock up any possible ideas they might have. Another being, it'll let the student complete the project to the best of their ability. Lastly, teacher-designed projects can get a bit stressful and overwhelming. Summer projects can benefit the students more if they're student-designed.

Student-designed projects allow the student to create the project freely with no restraints. For example, several weeks ago my forensics teacher gave her classes a project based on serial killers. The project was all up to the student except for the fact that it had to be a cereal box. It was fairly easy, we just had to pick a serial killer that we were interested in and also write fun and interesting facts about said serial killer. Very little were bad or plain, meanwhile, others were fun and entertaining with games, crosswords, toys, and other activities! I believe since we were able to do it on our ownÂ it enabled the class to receive higher scores on the project; therefore, we should be given student-designed projects.

Teacher-designed projects can get a bit excessive at times with a lotÂ of work which eventually lead to stressful and overwhelming situations. For example, before this school year started several friends of mine were gonna take AP US History, which they had received a summer project for the class. Their was summer was okay until about a week before school started. That's when they realizedÂ they should've started weeks ago as the project was a packet with several pages of questions. Frantically and desperatelyÂ they began their summer assignment, and well they may have lost some sleep due to staying up late but they ended up finishing. Although, my best friend had it the worse since she began her day with morning conditioning, followed by her going to work, and lastly afternoon practice and the stress from the summer project did't help. AP teacher-designed projects are lengthy and extra, which is why one should prefer student-designed projects.

In conclusion student-designed projects allow a student to be free with their own creativity and knowledge which allows them to work to the best of their ability. Also they don't produce as much stress as the teacher-designed projects. Lastly from other people one learns some teacher-designed projects can induce more stress into ones life which leads to other negative effects. Which is why teachers should make student-designed projects to let their students creativity roam free.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
70cd1937,"Dear Senator Nelson, In recent years, many people have called for the change of the presidential election process. Specifically, the Electoral College. Many consider it a pointless, unfair, and archaic system that denies the people the liberty of choosing their president. However, I believe the Electoral College is a necessity in modern America. Although it is as old as the country itself, it is still relevant and useful today.

The Electoral College ensures the outcome of an election. Without the Electoral College, the election may possibly need multiple reruns as a result of a tie in the popular vote. According to ""Does the Electoral College work?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president"". With that few of electors, it reduces the chances of a tie occurring. Although it can happen however, it's not probable. For example, if two candidates ever had a tie among the popular vote, it could be resolved within the college because of the way the slates of electors are divided up among the states. Some critics of the college say that this systems takes the control out of the peoples hands and denies them the right of choice. However, you have to remember that the people elect a slate of electors to vote for their candidate. That means that even though the College ultimately decides the president, the people still have someone to represent their candidates.

The Electoral College is also a necessity because it forces the candidates to face issues the people care about and to appeal to the masses. According to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: 5 reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So, a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pluralarity in those states"". This means that in order to win the popular vote and get a chance to win within the Electoral College, a candidate must appeal to the country, not just a particular set of voters who may have different views on politics than the majority of voters. Some people say that a candidate may try to appeal to a set of voters but in the end just use them in order to win the presidency. To that I say this. As a candidate, your ultimate goal is to serve two full terms as the president of the world's leading superpower right? Why would a candidate want to lie and jeprodize their chances at doing what they feel is right for the country?

In Conclusion, the Electoral college must not be done away with. It is a necessary tool to maintain fairness among the candidates and the election process. We have checks and balances among the government so one branch of government may never gain more power over the others so why not supervise the most important process in government? If you take anything at all away from this letter, please let it be this. The Electoral College is a staple in American politics. Without it, we would be denying our country the right to a fair election.",0,train_essays,,9

Cell phones distracts the driver from the road. It could cause an accident and potentially kill you. Texting and driving is also illegal in almost every state.

Being on a cell phone while driving distracts you. You can lose focus on the road and swerve into a different lane and cause an accident. Being distracted can cause you to miss a turn you were supposed to make. A car in front of you can make a sudden stop and if you're on your phone you wouldn't have a quick reaction.

Being on a cell phone while driving could have you in a very bad accident and you could potentially die. Continuously looking down at the phone and the road is difficult. The roads are not a straight path and looking at the phone you wouldn't be able to realize that your driving a slight curve and you swerve into another lane, then you look up and see that your in two lanes you try to swerve back into your lane and a car was coming up on the side of you and now your in an accident.

Some cops are petty and will put you in handcuffs. Others can be generous and let you off with a warning, but that doesn't make it okay to keep doing.

072D54558C64,"My agrument for this passage is that although theses cars seem to be really nice and might help save people from accidients and save money they may not be the best option. Driving is a very serious thing and in this agrument I'm going to tell why i think that they shouldn't be made. Driving can always need improvement why not keep the cars we have and help them out and keep people driving what they own. Plus money is a very important aspect in this agrument, having a driveless car can cost lots of money.

People who drive can say that they don't like driving all the time but most can say that they enjoy getting to drive if we have cars that are driveless that takes away the fun that people have. If we make these driveless cars that means that the newer generations with not know how to drive cars. People will not want ot get put as much if we have driveless cars. I don't think that people have the money to spend on these cars to drive them so we may have lots of people walking if we were to switch to these cars.

If driveless cars are made they is a very big possibility that people will not want to pay attention to the roads and that will cause more accidents than what there already is. Even though the drive is suppose to watch the road when in the car still doesn't mean that people wont think that the car can do it all on its own. They will not watch the road as much as what they do now and it can cause wrecks that are not needed.

Having drivers have a driveless car is not a good idea because they willl think it is okay to play on their phones and mess around in the car. The car may have antilock brakes but that does not mean that the car is completely save for being accident free. If we have teenagers that are driving in these cars they might think that it is expectable to play around even more than what they do now. Maybe adding things to cra sthat we have now and giving them some newer safety assets might be the solution to our problem. That might be a soultion to our probelm of accidents and it will still allow people to drive.

Another thing to think about is the laws that will have to change for these people to make these cars. Like speed limits and how the car will cars handle traffic in large cities. We alos have to think about if they are really a energy saver car or if it is just as bad as the cars we are using.

In conclusion, I think that this car shouldn't be developed for the reasons of safety. This car may have some very nice aditions to it but we still have to think about whats best for the drivers. The cars that we drive now can use some new technogly but having a driverless care kind of seems a little to extreme. People love driving so why not keep the cars we have today and just keep inproving to make them better for us.

But i feel like before anyone makes thier minds up about whether we should or shouldn't uses these cars that are driverless there needs to be more research done and tests to see how these cars work. ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
B1A435B54D4A,"As an 8th grader, I have been thinking a lot about my future and what I want to do when I grow up. Some people think it's important to make a career commitment at a young age, but I'm not so sure. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of making a career commitment at a young age and reflect on my personal experience to consider what it would entail.

On the one hand, making a career commitment at a young age can have some benefits. For example, it can give me a sense of direction and purpose, and help me focus on my studies. It can also give me a head start on my peers, and give me a chance to gain valuable experience and build my skills. Plus, it can be helpful to have a clear idea of what I want to do when I grow up, so I can start working towards it.

On the other hand, there are also some potential downsides to making a career commitment at a young age. For one thing, it can be hard to know for sure what I want to do with my life at this age. I might change my mind a lot, or find out that I'm not interested in the career I thought I wanted. It can also be stressful and overwhelming to have to make such a big decision at a young age, and it can be hard to balance my career goals with other important things in my life, like my relationships and my hobbies.

Personally, I have been thinking about what I want to do when I grow up, and I have a few ideas. I'm interested in science and math, so I might want to be a doctor or an engineer. But I'm also interested in art and music, so I might want to be a graphic designer or a musician. It's hard to decide, and I don't want to make a commitment that I might regret later.

To help me figure things out, I have been taking high school courses that are relevant to my career goals. For example, I'm taking biology and math classes to prepare for med school, and I'm taking art and music classes to develop my skills in those areas. I'm also trying to get as much experience as I can in my chosen fields, whether it's volunteering at a",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

3a4c655d,"Recent trends are showing that the average person is trading in their keys for a more contemporary mode of transportation, such as public transit or walking and biking from point A to point B. Even though the reason as to why this is occurring has yet to become clear, there are some general benefits that are known to come from this. More and more, cities in developed and developing nations are now being planned to be more dense, so that the citizens in them can get to where they need to be, without needing a car. Because of this, fewer greenhouse emissions are being created, there is less congestion and smog in cities, and the burden of traffic is being lifted from the everyday driver. The more this trend continues, the more beneficial it can become.

Climate change is a ubiquitous threat to the world. In order to face and reverse the direction of where the world is heading, some cities are finding new ways to face this issue. For example, a city in Germany has practically given up cars through its policies and design. Citizens are only allowed two places to park, and the city is designed so that everything you need is within a walking or biking distance, albeit more dense. More and more places are slowly beginning to adopt this style of suburb because ""emissions from an increasing middle class are choking cities"" source 1. Making this change will not be easy, but it is important because ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent ... in the United States"" source 1.

Another issue that weighs down cities everywhere is the horrid smog and unbearable congestion most cities face. In order to combat this adverse effect of driving, Paris has banned driving in efforts to reduce the smog it deals with. The effort proved to create a temporary solution, as ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog"" source 2. A city in Bogota, Columbia has taken a day off from driving, and the results were so positive that the movement has spread to multiple cities in neighboring countries. This movement ""left the street eerily devoid of traffic jams"" source 3.

In an ever changing world that exists today with cities that never sleep, the average person is constantly burdened and stressed by things that tend to pile up. So why have driving and traffic be added to that heap of annoyance, especially if it's avoidable? The fact is, driving can be incredibly stressful and sometimes border on superfluous. A resident of the densely populated german town where 70 percent of its citizens don't own cars claimed, ""when I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"", referring to how they no longer need to own a car or drive source 1. The day of no driving in Bogota, Columbia has been said to be""a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" source 3.

Modern nations have revolved heavily on the invention and continuous innovation of the automobile. However, the increasing dependence on this mode of transportation has created some adverse affects for the general population of the world. In order to solve this problem, an emphasis on cleaner and more efficient modes of transportation must occur, along with more densely designed, modern cities. A larger independence from cars can create fewer greenhouse emissions, cause less congestion and smog in cities, and make the average citizen free from the stress of driving.",0,train_essays,,3
F677B763457E,"Summer projects are a thing? I feel that summer projects for extended learning isn't something a student is going to want to do. Any student who struggles in school and isn't exactly the best student aren't going to want to take their time out of their free summer to do a bunch of schoolwork. I feel that summer projects are pointless unless students wish to take a summer class, but I was asked if our summer projects should be teacher based, or student based. This question has come to stump me. I believe there are benefits in both ways of doing a summer project. For this topic I'm kind of on the fence between student based projects and teacher based projects. For teacher based projects there are many cons and pros.

Teacher based projects will get students to feel obligated in doing the work over the summer, while student based projects students may forget to do because they never felt obligated to finish or even start the project. Teacher based projects seem to be the way to go when it comes to getting things done in an easier way, but what about the teachers? The teachers will be grading the same type of projects and soon getting bored or tired of grading the same things. So when it comes to student based projects, the students can embrace all of the creativity they have and make things more bright and fun to read over. When it comes to creativeness, I believe that students feel more motivated because they can make the project fun instead of boring and stressful. There is also the fact that when projects are teacher based, students may copy others just to get the project done and get a good enough grade and the teachers wouldn't know that the student copied anything, but within all these things I have mentioned, students will understand what and how to do the projects without asking many questions and will have a certain rubric to go off of. So going off of that fact, grading will be an easier job to do and the students will go based off of all the requirements needed.

Student based projects I feel are more of entertaining and creative just because of the fact that students can be themselves and do what they want for a project and have fun while making the project. Although the creative side to things may be a good thing, there is also the fact that students may think they are doing something wrong, or they may go completely off topic into something else and mess up the whole project and not learn a thing. When students have so many questions that it just ends up stressing them out, they aren't going to want to go through with the project because they will feel scared that they havn't done anything right. When students feel wrong, they usually give up or dont try to begin with and never learn anything over the summer break.

If I had to choose a side on this question I feel like I'd be more of on the student based projects. I would choose the student based projects because some students within school are afraid to express themselves. When you can't express yourself, you dont act like yourself. and I feel its better to be yourself rather than a walking, talking robot just going through every day life because you feel obligated to do so. Being able to express yourself takes things to a whole different level of fun and happiness and its also a way that teachers can better their knowledge about how the students are, but overall I believe that both sides are equally balanced in the ways they can be beneficial. The student based projects can be a whole lot more creative while the teacher based projects can be more accurate and beneficial for genuinely learning over the summer.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
4AB746C12224,"Driverless cars would truly be an immense change in the daily lives of every driver in the world. A future where getting a license is no longer heard of and taking driving tests would just be a part of history would be the effect of these cars. Imagine how current parents and grandparents say how they grew up without televisions or cell phones, later on they will be saying how they had to drive their own car, and it will be mind blowing to everyone's future children.

My personal opionion on driverless cars is against them. I don't see how it is necessary for all cars to be re-done and have so much work put in to the idea of driverless cars, when we could just simply drive them ourselves. I don't see the importance of it. I believe to have a license and be capable of driving is a grand achievement. Every child looks forward to the day they can pass, first their permit test, and then later on, their driver's test. What happens when the driverless car stops working and is only able to drive with an actual driver? The skill of driving is very important, and it would be a shame to see that skill no longer necessary to learn in the future.

I can think of many more downfalls to the driverless car than positives. Not to mention, the amount of problems that can come about with these vehicles. If the car suddenly goes out of control or the car has to pull in a driveway? The driver will need to take over. I don't see a high possibility of these cars becoming available considering the innumerable amount of mishaps that happen when driving.

The article mentioned that automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved, but how can they be positive? Things can easily go wrong with this make, and to me, the effect isn't worth the risk. Car crashes are very harmful things mentally and physically to a human being and who's to say driverless cars will stop them?

In conclusion, i can't picture driverless cars being the official cars of the future. In order for them to have their full use, everyone would have to have a driverless car. Expenses, weariness of the model, and people who aren't willing to give their driving ability up wil be the ones to put a stop to driverless cars. I think some may own a driverless car, but there will never be a time when driverless cars are the only cars being used.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
D176ABB06812,"""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" This seems to me like a bad idea. The driverless car, while having some good qualities, is overwhelmed with bad qualities. The risk and danger of driving would greatly increase due to the cars being more in control. Not only is this dangerous, but the cost of the vehicle will increase because the product is new and ""advanced"". When adding up the time being taken to drive a car rather than take a taxi, the taxi takes a greater amount of time to deal with. Some of the negative aspects of the driverless car are much greater in numbers than the positive.

The risk of the driverless car is much greater than the risk of simply driving oneself everywhere. Like taxis, putting your life in someone elses hands is always a greater risk. The driverless taxis just double the chances out wrecks considering that the car still has more kinks than anyone cares to recognize. In the reading, it was stated that the car can brake on it's own. While that could be seen as a convienience, it can also be seen as a danger. The car may brake when it's is not supposed to which could cause a wreck. The driverless cars are still not totally able to navigate through traffic with ease. Having a regular car seems to be the safer option, because the driver is in complete control.

The driverless car is much more costly to manage than a car controlled by the driver. The product is new, so the initial cost will be much higher. Also, the technology is supposed to be more convienient and user friendly. These positive aspects always seem to cost more than a regular car. The driverless car will have such a large initial cost, the owner of the car will be owing the company in which he bought it money for a long time.

It always seems more convienient to take a taxi rather than drive yourself in a big city. In larger cities, taxi services are found everywhere, but in smaller towns the number of taxi's are much smaller. It is unneccisary to take a taxi in smaller town because the traffic is more manageable. The taxi services are only needed for large cities to handle all of the traffic. The new driverless cars are still not managable on their own in high areas of traffic.

The number of cons seems to outweigh the pros. Safety is always a big issue to everyone because it is important that everyone is safe at all times. As the world progresses money seems to be more of an issue. Driverless cars are seemingly too expensive to buy in the first place, let alone the price of gas being a taxi service. The convienience of a taxi is always so pleasant until they are unneccisary, like in smaller areas. Personally, the driverless cars just seem to have too many negative qualities to be worth production. ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
DDC3C4A828DA,"It has been said that first imperssions are almost impossible to change, do you agree or disagree? In my past experience, I would highly disagree with this statement. When first meeting somebody, you don't always get the right thoughts about that specific person. Once knowing somebody personally your thoughts start changing, your mind starts messing up on thinking ""What should I think about this person?"". Due to my past experience I always have luck to my first opinion changing to a good opinion after getting to know them. I always ask my friends what were there thoughts of me when they met me for the very first time and all of my friends would always tell me that I look like I was mean and not very kind. After, they're opinions later changed once they got to me personally, knowing my personality and knowing how kind I am. My friends were very suprised.

Second, I would insists of not always having a first opinion on when seeing somebody for the first time because that usually is never how the person actually is. First imperssions always depend on the person on how there feeling or just based of anything that can be said.

Second impressions always get more better once they seen each other at least ones.

Third,

I would like to speak on my past experiences with this statement on why I disagree with this reasoning. When I was a couple years younger I had some very means thing said about me in middle school due to a couple of very mean people. Due to those sayings and rumors a various amount of people knew about me and the stuff that was said about me. People thought they already know me through thick and thin but in reality they really didn't. Once, I wanted to meet new people they never actually really wanted to speak to me or actually meet me because they already had there first impression because of the sayings. Later on, years started passing by and a few people started meeting me more and started speaking to me and once they did they noticed that I was very different person then what people would say about me.

First impressions are never good that's why it's never good to get based off that. You've read my about my past and now know why I don't go off that.

A3C8FABB8B29,"As an 8th grader, I'm excited to research the various job opportunities available to me after high school. It's important to know what options are out there so I can make informed decisions about my future. After researching, I found that there are many pros and cons to each occupation, and two that really interest me are being a software developer and a nurse.

Being a software developer sounds like a great job because it's in high demand and can be done remotely. I could work from home and still make a good living. Plus, I enjoy learning new things and problem-solving, which are skills that are essential for this job. However, it can be stressful and require long hours, which might not be for everyone.

On the other hand, being a nurse is also a great option. Nurses are always in demand and can work in a variety of settings, from hospitals to clinics. It's a job that's both rewarding and stable, and I could make a real difference in people's lives. Plus, it's a job that's not too stressful, which is important to me. However, it can be emotionally challenging at times, and I might have to work long hours or night shifts.

I think schools can better provide students with career choices by offering more career counseling and job shadowing opportunities. This would help students like me learn more about different occupations and figure out what we're interested in. It would also be helpful if schools provided more resources for students who are interested in specific fields, such as software development or nursing. This could include internships or mentorship programs that would give us hands-on experience and help us build connections in our chosen fields.

It's important for students to attend school to ensure future success because it provides us with the skills and knowledge we need to succeed in our chosen careers. School teaches us how to problem-solve, communicate effectively, and work well with others, which are all essential skills for any job. Additionally, attending school gives us access to resources and opportunities that we might not have otherwise, such as internships, job shadowing, and career counseling.

FE129177A067,"Venus, also known as the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the most challenging planets to work on. With its many volcanoes, and its atmosphere full of sulfuric acid, there is nothing safe to this planet. So why do us humans continue to pursue the trip despite the risk? Is it due to the similarity between it and the Earth? Is it really ""a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents?""

To start off, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, despite being second closest to the sun. This is because Venus contains the most volcanoes out of any planet. The thick atmosphere of Venus is composed of almost ninety seven percent carabon dioxide blankets. Like so, the clouds are made up of highly corrosive sulfuric acd, in which adds to the dangers of exploring this planet. On the surface of Venus, temperatures have the capability of averaging over eight hundred degrees Farenheit. To build off of that point, the atmospheric pressure is ninety times greater than what we experience here on Earth. Thus, these conditions are far much more extreme than any human being could handle.

An environment like so has the capability of crushing a submarine that is designed to dive into the deepest parts of the ocean, and along with that the temperatures would liquify many metals. Other factors such as powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes seek probes attempting to reach the surface.

In addition to atmospheric conditions, lets revisit why we even discuss further visits to Venus? Todays astronomers are extremely fascinated by the planet because they believe it was once one of the most Earth-like planets in our solar system. It is prpedicted that in some point in time, Venus was once largely covered in oceans and may have even had the capability of supporting various forms of life, similar to Earth. Venus still has failiar features to Earth, such as a rocky surface, valleys, mountains, and craters.

To continue the idea, how close are we to Venus? Earth is located between its two planetary neighbors, Mars and venus. Lets recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, in which is a crurcial consideration while considering the long time frames in order to pursue space travel. This may seem indisputable to many, however we need to consider, ""what are some other options for pursuing such a risky mission, while creating something in which can be both safe and scientifically productive? NASA has proposed an idea of basically hovering thirty miles above the surface in order to avoid the harsh conditons of the atmosphere. The upside, it would be a moree safe alternative. The downside, Astronauts would be unable to collect samples from the surface of Venus, which brings up a whole new concept of being ""scientifically productive.""

In conclusion, is Venus still worth the pursuit despite the conditions humans can and will face? We still are unsure of a final answer. If we want to further human exploration in space, then it is quite possibly worth the risk. If we are not in nedd of expanding research, then it is not necessary. However, it is quite the given that NASA

would like to expand its knowledge. NASA

continues to work on otherr approaches such as using a heavy duty material in which would last weeks in the conditions. Some equipment used in the past for others sorts of events, doesn't even require electronics at all, which is a major upside to the research of Venus and its aroma. Modern computers would be much to delicate to function in such conditions, and that is why NASA conitnues to pursue research and exploration of Venus. Finally, it is worth it to pursue such a captivating planet despite the intimidating factors. We can now reach a point in which nobody else in the world has reached. ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

Car companies seem to be losing business also. With more and more drives becoming pedestrians each day, it seems that private automobiles will soon be replaced by the old method of transportation, walking. This new option of transportation seems to be becoming a trend everywhere.

Less cars means less pollution. Major cities that are filled with cars seem be becoming more and more polluted each day. Big cities such as paris have taken major action, such as to temporarily ban driving, to reduce smog production. An article from the Chicago Tribune states""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""10. Pollution is becoming a big problem all over the world. Alternative transportation is one way you can help stop the pollution all over the world.

More exercise is allowed without cars. without cars, people are forced to get up and move to their destination instead of just sitting down your whole life. Obesity is becoming a big problem now all over the world but it has a very big impact in America. More people need more exercise and getting rid of cars is an excellent solution. Even with riding a bus, you would have to get up and walk to the bus stop. Alternative transportation could be the new big thing in exercise.

You can save money without a car. Due to inflation, cars cost a ludacris amount of money in modern day. People spend their whole lives trying to pay off an automobile. Not only do you have to pay off the Automobile itself but you must also pay for the gas, parts, and tools that come with it, which price continues to rise. It is also getting harder to find money and jobs as unemployment also rises while many salaries fall. It is very important to save your money and current day and maybe spend it on something more useful than an automobile.

As automobiles begin to become scarce among many counties, more and more benefits come with alternative transportation. The benefits of being able to save money, the ability to get in physical shape and to exercise more, and the ability to be smog free are all extremely important in today's society and environment. Automobile businesses are even thinking of partnering with other companies that produce products such as bikes, busses, or even making more sidewalks for pedestrians with alternative transportation.

6792C2E73B6A," In my opinion, success is not just about going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm, but also about learning from those failures and becoming a better person. While some people may agree with the statement that success consists of going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm, many others disagree with this perspective.

On one hand, failure can be a valuable learning experience that helps individuals understand what they need to do differently in order to succeed. By experiencing failure, individuals can gain a better understanding of their weaknesses and areas for improvement. This knowledge can help them to better prepare for future challenges and increase their chances of success.

On the other hand, some people believe that failure is not necessary for success. They argue that if they fail something, they learn from the experience and do better the next time. They also believe that everyone has both good and bad experiences, and that these experiences do not make a difference in the other's lives.

While it is true that no one is perfect, and everyone has both good and bad experiences, failure is still an important aspect of life. It is through failure that individuals learn to be better people and to overcome obstacles. By understanding their failures, individuals can learn from their mistakes and become more resilient in the face of future challenges.

In conclusion, while some people may agree with the statement that success consists of going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm, many others disagree with this perspective.

81B7A7CB8829,"A man named Albert Schweitzer once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". In this case setting an example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. For example, younger people look up to those who have struggled like they have and whom came from broke down homes and had succeeded through out their way. People are also influenced by those who have been into sports and who started in the struggle just like they've had, who later became the best. Showing good actions lead people to persuing you and your examples, which later leads them to the right path.

When Albert speaks of an example influencing others many ideas come to mind, one of which was how people who grew up in broke homes and succeeded with their life have had a huge affect on the youth. These people who are known for their success have gone through struggle and hard bottom rock moments. Although through out their journey people may have put them down, they still try their best in being a good example for others and the generation after them. People like this have gone to school and have worked hard in getting good grades to persue what they wanted to major in. They have gone through many obsticules to do what they love and see potential in. Leaders like these have worked their best to do what they want, which leads to having an amazing job with a great career.

Although many people look up to those who came from rock bottom, they also look up to those who are well known for their athleticism. As we may know football, basketball, wrestlers, soccer, ect. are sports that are well heard of through out different countries. These sports have not just helped people out with their physical apperiances but have also helped them out mentaly. For example, for those who have started from not knowing the sport and who were told that they weren't good enough didn't just give up because they were told so, instead it pushed them into getting better. For those who have tried the sport know that when you join a team you later find love for the sport and want to get better. Well known players have trained and worked hard everyday to be where they are today. They've taken risk and tried their best in their games or matches, they've given their all to be noticed by college coaches, or even scouts.

However, both doing great in school and being a great athlete have been known for being a example in influencing others. These two however different but very similar examples both persuade others in; working hard and trying their best. They influence people that you have to never give up in what you believe in or in what you hope to persue in life. They make you mentaly stronger and challange you in becoming the person who you soon hope to be. In conclusion, setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people.",0,original_moth,"Task: Research example of influential individuals who have risen from hardship, and those who have become successful in athletics.

E0E060143B79,"Failure: The Stepping Stone to Success

 Failure is often seen as a negative concept, something to be avoided at all costs. However, I believe that failure is actually a crucial stepping stone on the path to success. Without failure, we would never learn the valuable lessons that help us grow and improve. In this essay, I will argue that failure leads to success and the role of enthusiasm and try in achieving success.

Firstly, failure helps us identify our weaknesses and improve upon them. When we fail, we are forced to reflect on what went wrong and how we can do better next time. This process of self-reflection and improvement is essential for personal growth and development. For example, if I were to fail a math test, I would analyze my mistakes and work on improving my problem-solving skills. This process of self-reflection and improvement would help me become a better math student and eventually lead to success in the subject.

Secondly, failure teaches us the importance of perseverance and determination. When we encounter obstacles, we have two choices: give up or keep trying. If we choose to give up, we will never achieve our goals. However, if we choose to keep trying, we will eventually succeed. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" This quote highlights the importance of perseverance in achieving success.

Thirdly, failure can lead to creativity and innovation. When we fail, we are forced to think outside the box and come up with new solutions. This process of creative problem-solving can lead to groundbreaking discoveries and innovations. For example, the famous scientist, Albert Einstein, failed his entrance exam to the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School. However, he continued to work on his theories and eventually made groundbreaking discoveries that changed the way we understand the universe.

Finally, enthusiasm and try are essential for achieving success. Enthusiasm is the driving force behind our actions and helps us stay motivated and focused. Without enthusiasm, we will lack the energy and motivation to keep trying and eventually succeed. Try,",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay evaluating how failure leads to success and the role of enthusiasm and try in achieving success.,2

In Vauban Germany residents of an upper class community have done away with ninety precent of car driving, having only two places to park on the outskirts of the community. This has proven that by elimatating most car useage it makes people happier and less stressed out and helps provent the poplution that is cause by cars. ""I'm much happier this way"", said Hiedrun Walter a resident off this lavish community.

When you hear the word Smug what are your first reactions? It is this nasty poluted air that has trapped car emissions leaving a blaket of greyish air this is caused by ""cold nights and warm days. It is not good at all. when this happened in paris they banned cars from driving on certian days. ""If you have a lisense plate with an even number then you are not aloud to drive on mondays, Or if it is odd numbers then you are not aloud to drive on tuesday"". Until the smug has gone away.

318E4DA84F60,"""Oh my god"", said Generic_Name. ""Im too stressed from all the homework and tests, I can't do these extracurricular activities"". Me too, I said. This is too much work for us. ""How am I supposed to study for my test, If I have to do these activities"", Said Generic_Name. This is causing too much stress and anxiety among students, I said. ""Look at all of classmates, they all look so tired from all these activities"". I agree Its just too much for these students to handle all at once. This is also causing less effort on tests and other stuff. Which can also lead too worse grades and a bad mood among the students. ""My parents are gonna be mad at me now because of my grades""! I agreed my grades aren't looking the best too. We should tell the principal about this. Students shouldn't participate in any extracurricular activities because it causes too much stress and anxiety, worse grades, and from all the stress causes a bad mood.

First, extra activities are causing too much stress and anxiety for students. Stress is becoming a huge problem in schools. For example my friend Generic_Name had stress from all these activities and now he won't even talk to anyone. Anxiety is also becoming a huge problem in schools. Another example is my brother had so activities to do after schoolÂ it gave him anxiety and stress that his grades became terrible. Stress can eventually lead to depression which isn't good for anyone. For example my friend will had depression form school and the stress now he has to go to therapy. Overall extra activities cause these issues and aren't good for everyone.

Next, From activities students grades are getting worse. Grades are a huge priority for students. For instance my cousin had so many activities to do his parents got mad because of his low grades in school. Low grades will impact your future. Another example my sister had low grades because she had to time to fix them had to stay after school. Low grades will make you have a bad appearance. Last example is my classmate Generic_Name had very low grades form his extra activities that no one wanted to be friends with him. In the end extra activities result in low grades for students.

Last, the stress form activities will make you more frustrated and have a bad mood. Being frustrated would lower your effort and your grades. My classmate Generic_Name was so stressed and frustrated she didn't want to do anything in school. Having a bad mood would make you lose friends and get into fights easily. Next example my brother Generic_Name was so mad and stressed he didn't want to talk to anyone and he ended up losing a lot of friends. Too much frustration might lead to depression. Last example my cousin Generic_Name was frustrated from these activities he almost had depression. At the end being stressed and being frustrated is not good for the student.

""Im so happy"", said Generic_Name. I can't believe the principal said yes I said. ""Now we don't have to be worried about our grades"", said Generic_Name. ""No more being stressed about your grades""! I agreed now we have much more time to study and learn. Extra activities cause too much stress and anxiety among students. We don't have to be worried about these activities anymore.Â  Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

89163FC7FAE8,"The Electoral College is a fundamental way of electeing the us persident. It's been in the us for over 200+ years so why change it now. It work for the founding fathers George Wsahington, Thomas Jefferson, And Benjamin Franklin. Like they old Quote ""if it ani't broke don't fix it.""

Some of the reasons people want to elminate the Electoral College is because the way it works. For example if you live in texas and want to vote for a John Kerry you'd actualy vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to kerry. Who knows if they win the statewide election and go to congress with kerry. And what if ""this so called electors"" don't even have or hold an public office, who are they in the first place and how do they get picked. Many people congressional men and women want the Eletoral college gone because of the close calls it's had to make and some think those pick favored or didn't favor the country.

Like the 2000 fiasco which was one of the biggest election crisis of the century. And not to mention the 1960 of John F Kennedy which many segregationists replaced democratic electors with new ones who would oppose Kennedy. And yet same even oppose their own party's candidate for some they choose. Some states even send two slates with in them it happened in Hawaii in the same election. Thankfully Vice Persident Richard Nixion only validated only his opponent's electors, made sure to do so without giving up a percent.

But still people say a state like California whos population is apromximently 35 million people and 2 senates get to have the say over them that's what may make it difficult. Rhode island aswell because they only have a minimal population so they are not off so bad like others. And what about the now large amount of illeagal emmagints whom can't get a vote because of citizenship. They need it to vote and the ones who can offten don't know who they're voting for. At most basic level it seems unfair because of the winner-take-all system.

I say keep it because if the Electoral College vote ties then then the US House of Rep. and the Senate choose the winners. The House The Persident and the Senate the Vice Persident. You are the one who choose those who govern you not them so therefore choose whom you want and give them the benefit of the doubt.       Â     ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Now you wouldn'tÂ want to go in blind and get smashed with a metaphorical boat loadÂ of work because you didnt ask people what was going on or what was happening because you were uninformed.

One example would be going to a new restaurantÂ that is new in town were the service is OK butÂ not the best and the food is horrid all because you didnt check the reviews. You could have avoided wasting your time by just checking the reviews and taking other peoples opinionÂ on the restaurant but you didnt and now you see the importance of others opinions. also another example would be advisers such as school advisers or presidential advisers they both have the same job and that is to give you their opinion.

Cellular devices is becoming a big part of some life. In which one has to be on it while doing everything such as eating, taking shower, working, and everyone favorite driving. Studies have found that distracted driver crashes was because of an cellular device. However, many continue to use their devices while driving and don't see the problem with it. Driving while on a device could be dangerous for you and whoever else is around you resulting in someone being injured or even killed. On a device while driving should not be prohibited and should have harsher consequences for those that do do.

In the present day, there is studies going on that proves that 1 in 4 of car accidents in the United States had been an result of texting while driving. In which, at any given time throughout the day, about 650,000 are wanting to use their cellular device while operating an automobile. These devices have became a big part in our everyday lives. However, it becomes a dangerous risks if someone want to decide check social media or any mobile applicant while operating a vehicle. Cell phone distracts are very high that why laws are put in place so that people have consequences for those that break laws put others in danger. Including the fact that 94 percent of drivers would support the ban to stop driving while texting and 74 percent support an ban on hand-held cell phone usage.

Laws such as Hand-held Cell Phone Use Ban, All Cell Phone Ban, and Text Messaging Ban are put in place to prevent crashes and a drivers distraction from the road. The Hand-held Cell Phone Use Ban is in 16 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands prohibit all drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving. While the Text Messaging Ban is in 47 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands ban text messaging for all drivers with Missouri prohibits text messaging by novice or teen drivers. So States like Georgia, Louisiana, Washington, Oregon, and Maine have it were you will get fined $100-$500 for break these laws. But states Alaska and Utah can fine you $750-$10,000 or even one year of imprisonment.

Most of these laws are created and being enforced so that someone won't put their life or lives of others in danger.

In conclusion, cell phone shouldn't not be used while operating a vehicle. It could be very dangerous and lead to death so that's why laws are put into place.

E6338A929654,"Having self reliance is a important key to success in life because self reliance is making your own efforts and decisions. I agree that people should make their own decisions because they should have freedom to make their own choices. They should think for them self.

Having the freedom to make their own choices is important because if they can have the freedom to choose what they want the experts are going to choose something that they dont like, or want. For example, the person wants to buy some fancy shoes but the authorities dont like those shoes they are going to say no and decide to buy other shoes. In my thinking I would not like to someone choose for me because they dont know what I like, or what I dont like. If they let other people make there choices they are not going to be happy because the expert or the authorities are going to choose what they like not what the people want. For example, they go to the lunch room and there is a lot of food there and they are trying to get something but they dont let them get what they want because they dont have the freedom to make there own choice, so the authorities are going to come and choose the food for them.

Another reason is that the person can think for them self. If the persons cant think for them self they are going to have a lot of problems in there life because if the expert, or the authorities comes and ask the persons something and they cant think, the experts are going to think for the persons and make choose something that the persons will not like.

In conclusion, having the right, or the freedom to make the decisions for them self is a good think because everyone wants to make their own decisions they dont want no one to be telling them what to do, or what to think.

4E947C63E6E9,"Students should be in at leastÂ one or more extracurricular activities because they can meet new people and make new friends, find out they are actually really good at the thing they are doing, and they can learn new things about something that they never knew about; in this read you will see why it is good for students to participate in a activity and maybe this will persuade you to join one.

Here is the first reason why students should join activities. Students can make new friends and meet new people if they are in an activity with a group. For example, when I started doing orchestra I made lots of new friends and I met people that I didn't even knew went to my school; also that were in some of my other classes. When I moved up to other orchestras I made more and more friends. I am really glad I joined, because then I wouldn't have met all those people and my friends. Also you might find someone who has the same interests as you do and you can maybe be try and be their friend.

The second reason why students should be in one or more activities. When students have joined a after school activity or just a during school activity or even an elective. Some students have said that the activities they are in became their new hobbiesÂ and they found out that they were actually good at it. If you join a activity and you really like it maybe you can make a career out of it. Isn't that how most famous sports players became so good at the sport and make lots of money. It's because they might have tried out the sport during school or even after. They figured out that they were really good at it. So they tried for leagues and other sport events and made it their career. So maybe if you join an activity you might be surprised and find out you are good at it.

Here is the last reason why I think students should join one or more activities. When people have join and activity they might have learned about something that they never knew was a thing or maybe just something cool to do. For example when you join soccer you can learn lots of tricks and cool things you can do with the ball. Also when I joined orchestra I never knew how to do any cool hand positions and shift up on the strings. But throughout the years of me playing I learned mostly all the things to know. Also I learned about new people who played the same instrument as me. So join something, you can learn lots of new things.

Throughout this whole essay you have read about why students should join a extracurricular activity. Examples like you can learn new things, meet new people and make new friends, and people found out that they were good at the activity. So the next time you see a flier posted up about an activity. Give it a try you might find out that you really like it and find out you are really good at the sport or whatever you choose to do.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

darragh_claude_v7_937,"The Development of Driverless Cars

While driverless cars present some opportunities, on the whole their development poses too many risks and uncertainties. According to the article, autonomous vehicles could potentially save lives by reducing accidents caused by human error. However, the technology also introduces new safety concerns that need to be thoroughly addressed before these cars are rolled out on public roads.  

For one, it remains unclear how driverless cars will handle unexpected situations that their sensors and programming did not anticipate. The article notes that vehicles may have trouble navigating ""unusual objects"" like fallen trees or recognizing complex traffic patterns. With no human operator behind the wheel, accidents could potentially be deadlier or more confusing in emergency scenarios. Moreover, these systems are vulnerable to hacking attacks that endanger passengers. Before driverless cars become mainstream, developers must find reliable ways to defend against digital threats from criminals.

Privacy is another issue raised by the development of autonomous vehicles. The data collected by their sensors about passengers and surroundings raises privacy concerns. This data could reveal personal details if accessed by third parties without consent. Regulations are lagging behind technology on matters of data ownership and usage. Additionally, many people may simply feel uncomfortable surrendering control to a computer while in a one-ton moving machine. Driverless cars upend a basic human activity and responsibility in a way that could undermine individual freedom and autonomy. 

In conclusion, while driverless cars hold the promise of increased safety and mobility, their potential downsides pertaining to safety, privacy and personal freedom are too serious to ignore. More research is warranted to solve the technology's weaknesses before widespread adoption. Overall, the risks currently outweigh the benefits, suggesting development of driverless cars should not be rushed.

3a8bc31244c9_04112023,"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed to guard against manipulation and give small states influence, I believe the popular vote better reflects the will of the people in modern America.

One argument made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and appeal to a wide range of voters across many states. However, research shows that candidates now focus their efforts only in swing states that could vote either way. Over 90% of campaign visits and ad spending are concentrated in only a handful of closely divided battleground states. This leaves voters in many solidly red or blue states feeling ignored. Electing the president by popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign across the entire nation and appeal to more Americans regardless of which state they live in. 

It is also argued that the Electoral College protects the influence of smaller states. However, nearly all sophisticated democracies manage to respect their geographic constituencies without an electoral college, often through proportional representation in their legislatures. A national popular vote does not require changing these Senate-related compromises that protect smaller states. It simply means that every American's vote would be counted equally in choosing the national executive. Under the current system, presidents can win the Electoral College while losing the national popular vote. This undermines faith in elections and makes some Americans feel their votes do not truly matter. 

In conclusion, while the original intent of the Electoral College was to safeguard the election process, advances in communications and transportation have rendered its advantages obsolete in today's society. Election by popular vote is a simpler, fairer way to elect the leader of our diverse nation that is responsive to citizens across all states. I urge you to support legislation replacing the current system with a national popular vote for president.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,4

They have many companies who are making driverles cars. The companies beleive that its not the smart car .They belive the roads need to be smarter in general. The roads chould give the car signals from the front of the car. The car read positive and negitive polarity as messages in binary code .They thought the roads wernt going to work but they did.

Finally,they concluded that these smart cars chould work really wel for peole one day. The only thing is that u whould have to watch the road just to make sure everything is going okay. Without the idea of smart roads you whouldnt have smart cars .The cars basicly are smart cars because of the smart roads. The car has many senors in and outside oif the car to help it drive by its self. The car also lets you know if there are any problems or if it needs help.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

Well then tell me replied the man. It's a great and exsiting adventure were you go on a boat acrost the Atlantic or the Pacifac and help the contrys in ruin by bringing animals and food for the animals.

Well but don't you think that I could do more by just donating money asked the man. When you donate money it gets spit up and a small percentege of the money goes to each indevidual contry in need. However with this program you can help a country very effectivly by bringing hundreds of animals overseas at a time. But that sounds like much more work than just donating money. If you join the seagoing cowboys you will get to see many exsiting things and you will be helping more than you could if you just donated money.

Well I do have alot of spare time on my hands since I got fired from my job and nothing else to do said the man. Well then you can join the program and help the countrys in need. You know what I will take a flyer. I garentee you will not be disaponted. Thank you said the man.",0,persuade_corpus,,9

D679B3291B9C,"Partnerships between schools and companies can have numerous benefits for both parties. For schools, partnerships can provide financial support, resources, and opportunities for students. For companies, partnerships can provide access to a talented pool of potential employees and help them develop their brand. However, the impact of these partnerships on individual students can vary depending on the specifics of the partnership and the student's individual circumstances.

One benefit of partnerships between schools and companies is the availability of loan options for students. Many companies offer tuition assistance or other forms of financial aid to students who are pursuing a degree or certification that is relevant to their business. This can be especially beneficial for students who may not have the financial means to attend college or graduate school on their own. Additionally, companies may offer internships or apprenticeships to students, which can provide valuable experience and help them build their professional network.

However, working while in school can also have a negative impact on students' mental and financial stability. Balancing schoolwork with a part-time or full-time job can be challenging, and students may struggle to maintain their grades and achieve their academic goals. Additionally, working while in school can be stressful and may lead to burnout, which can have long-term negative effects on mental health.

To pursue their desired courses of study and life goals, students should consider a variety of strategies. One option is to apply for scholarships or grants, which can provide financial support and help students focus on their studies without the added pressure of working. Additionally, students can consider taking on internships or apprenticeships during the summer months or after graduation, which can provide valuable experience and help them build their professional network. Finally, students should consider networking with professionals in their desired field and seeking out mentorship or guidance from experienced professionals.

In conclusion, partnerships between schools and companies can have both positive and negative impacts on individual students. While these partnerships can provide financial support and valuable experience, they can also be stressful and may negatively impact students' mental and financial stability. To pursue their desired courses of study and life goals, students should consider a variety of strategies, including applying for scholarships, taking on internships, and seeking out mentorship and guidance from experienced professionals.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0
5B14D0F18119,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, Thats because they want to choose the right decision and if they choose wrong, then something terrible could happen, or you will just regret it. Sometimes you question your self and ask ""should I do this or that?"" sometimes you go with your own advice, or you go to a friend or someone. But in my opinion, I think you should always ask a friend, or a family member, for advice even if you think your advice is wiser/better than theirs.

Seeking multiple advice from different people is good because it makes gets you thinking about what to do in that situation like, ""do I do this do I do that!"" so you gather all the advice that you got from the people, you asked and you talk about it see if thats what you want to do, and you do it like I said your advive isn't bad, you just think that the other advice is better, like say you got accepted to two different colleges take your own advice then go get more advice from a family member or a friend, So you got their advice you compare it to yours, and see which one you like more.

6479d145,"The Electoral College has been around since the Constitution was established by the founding fathers. The question is, Is it time for it to go? I believe that the Electoral College should be kept, because changing the election by popular vote would not be wiser, and the Electoral College is fair for the people.

Changing the election by popular vote would not be smarter. Source 3 states, ""In 2012's election... Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and rodney."" This source is arguing against the Electoral collegee, meaning they're trying to make a point on why it's not fair that Obama won with his 61.7 percent. The people vote for their electoral collegee, for their state. If the electoral collegee's votes are higher than the popular votes that means that the collegee is doing their job correctly. Source 3 also states, ""... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state."" This statement means that even if the popular and electoral votes are both high, the electoral vote wins, because majority rules. Just because the person running for office is popular, doesnt mean they should necessarily win. Electoral votes basically come from the people, and if the ""people"" choose a certain candidate, then that's who should win.

The Electoral College is fair to everyone. Source 2 states, ""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This method of choosing the president is completely and totally fair to the people. No, they're not directly choosing who the president is, but they have people to do it for them. As long as they cast in the right vote for the party that that candidate represents, then the Electoral collegee board should be filled with all the right people. Yes there is a possibility that the candidate someone votes for may not make it on the Electoral collegee board, but if the majority of the people are represented, then that's all that matters. Source 3 states, ""...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that truth is barely betrayed... however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" For instance, if the people vote for candidates for the electoral collegee, and the majority of them are not what the majority of the people wanted, or they lied about being pledged to a candidate for president, then there is still a chance that the candidate that the people did want could be elected, by the national popular vote. Also, the people that are against the electoral collegee shouldn't be, because the electoral collegee is not definite. Just because the electoral college votes for a certain candidate, does not guarantee that the overall national vote will be that person.

Eventhough some people think that the electoral collegee, should be no more, I strongly disagree, because the collegee is fair to the people because they represent the people and the collegee is a smart idea. The collegee works in everyone's favor. For those that disagree, there is always a strong chance that the candidate represented by the electoral collegee will not win presidency.

In conclusion, the Electoral collegee is beneficial to the people and a wise idea. The people in the entire country are never going to unanimously agree on anything. Keeping the Electoral collegee is not only wise, but a safe way to ensure that voting doesn't go wrong, and that the people always get a fair say in government matters.",0,train_essays,,0
CF4E6D77F514," Our cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, and while they offer numerous benefits, they can also be a source of distraction, particularly for students. Some educators argue that students should be allowed to use their cell phones for educational purposes, while others believe that they should be restricted from using them in class. While cell phones can be a useful tool for learning, they can also have a negative impact on a student's academic performance.

One of the main ways that cell phones can be a distraction for students is through the various apps that are available. Social media platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook can be particularly tempting, and students may become easily distracted by these apps, even when they are supposed to be focusing on their classwork. Additionally, students may receive text messages from friends or family members that could distract them from their studies.

Another way that cell phones can be a distraction for students is through the temptation to cheat on exams or assignments. With access to the internet and various communication tools, students may be tempted to share answers with each other or to search for answers online. This can undermine the integrity of the educational process and make it more difficult for students to learn and retain information.

Furthermore, cell phones can be a distraction for students because they can take away from their focus on their studies. By constantly checking their phones, students may not be fully engaged in their classwork, which can lead to poor academic performance. Additionally, students may become easily distracted by notifications, messages, and other features on their phones, which can further take away from their focus.

In conclusion, while cell phones can be a useful tool for learning, they can also be a source of distraction for students. Teachers and students should be mindful of the potential distractions that cell phones can present and take steps to minimize their impact on academic performance. This may involve setting rules and guidelines for the use of cell phones in the classroom, as well as encouraging students to focus on their studies and put their phones away when they are not needed.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

9F1EEDC186E3,"Summer is a time of hanging out with friends at the beach and relaxing in the warm weather, but there is always something that swoops in to mess it up: a summer project. Summer projects are not all bad, for they are designed to ensure that students continue to learn during their three month getaway from school. However, who should design the summer project the student or the teacher? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have more experience with projects than students, and students will lean toward designing a quick and easy project.

Teachers have had more encounters with school assigned projects in their lifetime than their students. Most teachers have college degrees. They have done the twelve plus years of primary school to graduate, and then gone on to college and done two to four more years to get their degree. Through all that schooling many projects have been assigned and completed. All of this gives teachers the proper experience and background to come up with a well designed summer project for their students. Just this past summer my computer system networking teacher, Mr. Generic_Name, assigned us a project. It was a review project incorporating all of the course material from my sophomore year that he did not want us to forget during the summer. I remember how well rounded of a project it was, so much so that I had to ask him how he come up with it. Mr. Generic_Name told me that the project was inspired by all the projects he encountered during his four years at William and Mary. Due to Mr. Generic_Name having plenty of experience with higher education projects, it allowed him to design a well developed summer project for my peers and I. I can only imagine the toddler like projects that would have been produced if my peers and I were allowed to design our summer projects instead of Mr. Generic_Name.

More than likely if a student is given the opportunity to do less work they are going to take that opportunity. Throughout my years of high schoolÂ I have seen this exact manner take place over and over. Students will take the easy way out by selecting courses that have a history of demanding very little from those enrolled. This same mannerism repeats itself once the student is enrolled in a course and it comes time to actually work. Just this past marking period my Math Analysis teacher, Mrs. Generic_Name, gave us a take home test for winter break. This test consisted of 47 problems. The more problems you did the higher grade you got, but students did not seem to take advantage of this. More than half of my class chose to only do 30 of the 47 problems. This was because completing 30 of the 47 problems earned the minimum for a passing grade, a 70 percent. My peers had full control of their grades and chose to only work for the minimum passing score so that the rest of their winter break would be free of math. This is what will occur if a student is allowed to design their own summer project. Once a student realizes that they get to design their project they will make it something simple, lousy, and childlike. The student will design something just good enough too pass, so that they can return to their more practical summer.

Some argue that a student would be more inclined to do their project if they got to design it. However, this is not true as someone's interest in something does not determine whether they will do it or not, but their work ethic is the true determining factor. Summer projects serve a meaningfulÂ purpose; to make sure kids maintain learning and strengthening their brains even when school is out. Something with a strong purpose like that should not be taken lightly and should be handled by someone who can produce the best project. This is why summer projects should be teacher-designed, so that students can take away as much information as possible when the project is all said and done.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
C2758D58392E,"Luke Bomberger did'nt get to visit many places around the world and see things he may have wanted to see because he never had anytime to. He was always buisy trying to help people with banking and shopping with in his home town. Really what he didn't know was that he was going to be helping all kinds of people around the world a long ways from his town. So when Don Reist invited him to go he knew that was a chance to really help other people and get more money.

Luke Bomberger knew that he could visit lots of places. He actually got to visit a,""castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China"". He got to do things he would'nt have been able to do in his old town. After World War ll in 1945, lots of people were left with nothing and did'nt have food to care for everyone. So with the help of the,""Seagoing Cowboys"",they would help transport animals to those places so they could have food to live.

I think more people should join this program because it gives others a chance to live and survive after wild events like wars. Many people in the world work as doctors and vets for those who live around them. But they also have the chance to help people far away who need it. Not only that but they can still work with animals. It may not be dogs and cats they are working with but they can still help animals and other people.

Luke enjoyed being apart of the program because he knew he had the chance to visit many polular places. So I think that instead of planning a vaction to go the beach you can go other places that you may not have been to before rather than going to the same places everytime. When you think of being someone that transports animals across seas you don't normally think of being a doctor. But really what people don't think about is that when they give animals to people the animals are recorce for food which helps people that may be sick or need to food because they don't have animals near. So its important to everyone.

Really the big idea to this program is that people reliey on animals and their recorces. But its very hard for people to have to leave there town to find food and bring that back for everyone. So this program is very important to others because they know people will care for them when they need it. It's also very good education when you visit places like unwealthy towns so you can get a feel of what it's like for them and how much they need people like us. After all Its important to care for others.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
D95605EC040B,"In ""The Challenge of exploring Venus"" the author very well suggests that study of Venus is worthy despite the dangers. The author does this by stating the dangers and the way NASA is trying to over come these dangers. NASA is doing reserch and test to try to find a way for a mechion to last up there. There is a lot of reason why the author very well supports the idea studing Venuscis a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

A reason why the author supports this claim is in the texts its states,""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" We can maybe learn more about Earth by learning about Venus because they are simlar in a lot of way. That is why it is important to try to find a safe way to explore Venus.

9B23FE314CF5," Influencing others can be achieved through various means, but it is important to note that the way we behave can have a significant impact on how we influence others. For example, a person who consistently exhibits good behavior may be more effective in influencing others to adopt positive behaviors. However, it is also important to consider the potential consequences of our behavior on those we seek to influence.

One of the ways in which our behavior can influence others is through the example we set. Children, in particular, are often influenced by the behavior of their parents and other adults in their lives. If a parent consistently smokes or drinks excessively, for example, a child may be more likely to adopt similar habits. Similarly, if a parent is involved in criminal activity, a child may be more likely to follow in their footsteps.

It is important to note, however, that the impact of our behavior on others can be long-lasting. A person who has a criminal record, for example, may find it difficult to travel to other countries or obtain employment. This can limit their opportunities and make it more difficult for them to turn their life around. Similarly, a person who has a history of bad behavior may struggle to form healthy relationships and may be more likely to engage in risky or harmful behaviors in the future.

In order to effectively influence others, it is important to be mindful of our behavior and to strive to set a positive example. This may involve educating ourselves and our children about the importance of good behavior and the potential consequences of engaging in harmful activities. It may also involve seeking out opportunities to mentor or support others in their journey towards positive change.

In conclusion, the way we behave can have a significant impact on how we influence others. It is important to be mindful of our behavior and to strive to set a positive example, particularly when it comes to the behavior of children. By doing so, we can help to create a more positive and harmonious society for all.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

darragh_claude_v7_768,"Limiting car usage has several important environmental and public health benefits that all citizens should be aware of. As our passages explain, reducing individual car trips can improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. When fewer vehicles are on the road each day, there is less pollution from car exhaust being released into the atmosphere. Passage A notes that transportation is a major source of air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can have serious negative health impacts when inhaled regularly over long periods of time. By driving less and relying more on alternatives like public transit, biking or walking, each person reduces their own contribution to air pollution and the risks that poses for public health on a community-wide level. 

Cutting back on car usage also lessens traffic congestion on city streets according to Passage B. With fewer cars clogging up roadways during morning and evening commutes, transit times become more predictable and reliable for buses, as well as for bikers and pedestrians trying to navigate busy intersections. Less idling in traffic jams means emissions reductions too. Additionally, easing traffic congestion makes streets safer as there is less chance for accidents in high-density vehicle areas. Passage C reiterates this point, noting European cities that have limited car access to downtown cores report fewer traffic incidents once restrictive policies were implemented.

Aside from environmental and safety benefits, limiting car usage can also save citizens money in the long run as outlined in Passage D. By relying less on personal vehicles for transportation needs and embracing alternatives, people spend less on car payments, insurance, gas and maintenance costs over time. That savings can then be put toward other priorities. Public transit fares are also typically much more affordable per trip than driving. Encouraging citizens to drive less through restricting parking or implementing congestion charges, for example, can shift norms around transportation habits while putting savings back in peoples' pockets. 

In conclusion, as the passages demonstrate, reducing individual car trips and limiting overall car usage provides clear advantages for both the environment and public health of communities. By embracing alternatives and adjusting transportation behaviors, citizens can help improve air quality, alleviate traffic, and potentially save money - all worthwhile goals that deserve consideration and support. Increased awareness of these benefits could encourage more widespread adoption of low-carbon transit options going forward.",1,darragh_claude_v7,Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage.

A84FFDD09442,"We all know how important it is to have a positive outlook on life. A positive attitude has the power to encourage us through the difficult times, to obtain better results, and to achieve our goals. Having a healthy attitude helps us to make more meaningful connections in our personal and professional lives. 

It is no surprise that having a positive attitude can help us to tackle many of lifeâs tricky situations, from job interviews, to managing relationships, to simply navigating through life. It gives us strength and helps us remain focused on the big picture even when faced with adversity and setbacks.

One example of having a positive attitude leading to success is Bill Samuels Jr. After initial failure from whiskey-making, he didnât give up. He believed in himself and his skills, and was able to persistently work on a new recipe he initially believed had no chance of succeeding. It eventually led to his family's creation of Makerâs Mark, one of Americaâs most popular brands of whiskey.

No matter how hard life may seem at times, having a positive attitude and believing in yourself can make all the difference.

So he decided to do a video chat with his class, so he didnt he didn't have to miss anything from school. Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Doing oline stuff and video conferencing is a great way for students to stay on task with their work. I think that students would take the benificial of being able to attend to school from home because they have responsibilities and also a future ahead of them.

First reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they have responsibilities. What if you get sick and don't want to miss anything then you can just video chat with the class. Your familiy decide to take a trip somewhere on a school week what do you do. You take your school stuff with you and a laptop to talk with the class. You can't miss more than like 9 days of schoo if you do you automatically fail, and that's your biggest responsibility on not failing, so you can take the advantage of video chatting with your class. Those are the reasons why I say students should do a video confrence because they have responsibilities.

Second reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they might want to have a future ahead of them. When you are in your senior year that's when ou got to step up your game. What if you miss the bus or don't have a ride and you can't get to school then you obviously just video chat with your classes. If you don't understand with your school work you can do learning stuff online so you don't feel behind. Doing online stuff as well help students who don't know what they are doing and feeling left behind. Those are the reasons why students should do video confrences and online stuff because they want to have a future ahead of them.

Lastly, some people don't want to take the benificial of having video confrences or oline stuff to do school stuff at home. The reason why they don't want to do that is because when they are home they just want to have free time not to do school work at home. Also when they are sick they don't do anything because they think that they don't have that much work to miss. Well you see when you are home not doing anything then what are you getting done obviously nothing because they think that when they go back to school they won't miss that much work. That's why you should either do online stuff or a video confrence with your classes so you don't miss anything or be left behind.

There are many reasons why students should take the benificial of doing stuff like that because they have responsibilities and also have a future ahead of them.",0,original_moth,"Task:

B7C81B9A0C1A,"There are many ways a person can get from one place to another whether it is by bus, plane, train or car. Car and truck transportation is one of the leading causes in air polution. Ruducing the use of cars will be beneficial to the public, not only on the streets, but to the citizens themselves.

To start off, the reduction of cars on the streets will cause less stress to the people who drive them. For example, in Source 1 it shows how a woman is happier and the loss of her car has changed her life for the better. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" she says. The tension of being in a car and waiting in traffic can be stressful and cause people to get impatient, grumpy, and even irritated. The woman proves that her life has changed because she doesn't have to go through that anymore. Her car-less life is the one that makes her happy.

Besides that, not only does car reduction cause better mood for people, but it also lessens the air pollution and makes the enviornment cleaner and better for people to live in. According to Source 4, ""If the pattern persists- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" This proves that when cars are being used less, there is also less carbon emission into the air and that is helpful to the enviornment. This benefits and makes the air cleaner and safer to breathe.

Now with every thing good, there is always a bad. In source 2 it is explained how the delivery companies were complaining of lost revenue. Yes, this will be a problem with the delivery companies, but there are other ways of transporting goods to their destination such as by train, boat etc. Also in Source 2 there were arrangements made for the the cars to go out on certain days, so the delivery companies' problems were not all that bad. The reduction of cars benefits the public more than it what it hurts.

The results of limiting car usage has been greatly proven through studies done (in source 4) and it is believed that it should continue to be limited and or reinforced. The people are happier, the enviornment is safer and the air is clean. There is more help than there is hinder and soon it will be seen throughout the world that cars are better in the garage.

NASA has proven in so many ways that itÂ´s just a natural landform, but of course some people think that itÂ´s not natural at all.

First, NASA was very suprised to see something like that on the camera of Viking 1 spacecraft. But that went away really fast. Â¨Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa,common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows made it like an Egyptian Pharaoh.Â¨(2) This tells you that itÂ´s just a natural landform. Not a alien artifact .

Also, NASA wanted to go see if itÂ´s a artifact or just a natural lanform. Â¨Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.Â¨(7) This tells you that they never found an alien artifact on April 5,1998. All they found was a natural landform on Mars.

Finally, since not everyone was convinced that it was a natural landform, NASA decided to go back and get an even clearer picture of the Martian mesa. This time they used an even stronger camera to show the world that NASA is right.""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,Â¨ he added. Â¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!Â¨(11) This can tell you that NASA was trying to tell everyone that their cameras are good enough to spot and see if itÂ´s just a natural landform, so now you shouldnÂ´t be complaning about the pictures.

All of this evidence can tell you that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform, not a alien artifact. Their are still a lot of people who think that martians do exist and they will think anything that is not normal on Mars is martian. However there is no martians on Mars. What do you think?

I. Introduction

Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about why it's important for people to make their own decisions about life's big stuff. Like, you know, what we wanna do when we grow up, who we wanna hang out with, and what kinda food we wanna eat. It's pretty darn important, if you ask me.

So, like, what are life's important matters? Well, I think it's stuff like what career we wanna have, who we wanna marry, and where we wanna live. Those are some pretty big choices, and we should get to decide for ourselves.

II. Profitability of making own decisions

Okay, so, making our own decisions can be pretty cool for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it saves us money! If we make our own decisions, we don't have to rely on others to tell us what to do. That means we can save money on things like consultants and experts, and we can use that cash for something else. Like, maybe we can use it to buy a new video game or something!

And secondly, making our own decisions can lead to a healthier financial future. If we make smart choices, we can save up for things that really matter to us, like a new bike or a trip to the beach. And if we make bad choices, well, we can just learn from our mistakes and do better next time. It's like, the best way to learn is by doing it ourselves!

III. Unhealthy decisions from experts

But, like, sometimes people don't make the best decisions. And that's where experts come in. They might tell us what to do, but sometimes they're wrong. They might think they know what's best for us, but they don't really understand what we want. So, it's important to listen to them, but also to make our own decisions. That way, we can be sure that we're making the right choice for ourselves.",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Write an essay on why people should make their own decisions about lifeâs important matters.

61A0FEA827E4,"Greetings ,my name is Generic_Name. I go to Generic_School and I'm a junior this year. I was just recenlty informed that some schools require students to complete a summer project in order for thme to contiue to learn. But now the questions arises, should said projects be student designed or should the teachers design it? Although some would say teacher designed projects are better because the teachers have an understanding in the topic and can provide accurate deatils for better clarity. Actually I believe student designed projects are better because students could develop working enviroment skills and could make it relativly easy.

By a show of hands who likes summer... because i sure do. Shouldnt summer be a time spent learning or accomplishing other activitys like learning to drive, learning to bake or even learning to maintain a source of income. Student designed projects would be easy and short something that could be done in a short time spand.

Not something that requires me to look up, double check for accuracy, cite sources, revise,noodletools, and then hope I dont forget about it or lose it. Students know students best, plus it could develop skills for future planning because of course not all of them are going to be the same, some will be easy and others more challenging it can be a brand new experience for the students to design and for the teachers to look upon their ideas.

Another side to look at is if a teacher designs a project soley online. What if i go to a place with no internet? How am i suppose to do so if i cant access the document? Well theres nothing i can really do but, if students design a number of different projects some could be on papar and others online that way I could get options on what I'd be ok doing. For example some could be just to ""read a book""

or some could even be creative like ""draw a place you visited while over the break"". Point is students have a greater imagination than teachers in most aspects and could make a varity or projects and not just stick to the same one for everyone.

Now for a story. In my entire life ive only had one summer project and it was back in middle school. The goal was to just read a chapter book and then to write about it. That year i had read all 6 of the star wars books from ""Phantom Menace"" to ""The Jedi Return"". But i decided to write about ""Revenge of The Sith"" which is my favorite book/movie from the prequel era. I honeslty didnt know how to start the writing ,as a surpirse to no one I was and still am a pretty weak writer. But eventually I came around to write about Anakins insecuritys and the fact no one was honestly there to help him through his dark time and that it consumed him even making him hurt the ones he loved. Now keep in mind I had finished about a week into summer so I was pretty much free to do what I wanted. That same summer I had traveled to Honduras for 2 and a half months to visit. But as soon as I returned school was satrting and I had completely forgotten about the assignment and to put the icing on the cake It was lost.

I believe student designed projects would be better for its simplicity and for all the groups involved to get a new experience weather its the manner of grading or designing it. Wouldnt you like to have more time to enjoy your summer break or would you honestly prefer a harder time doing whatever the teacher mightve brewed up while on their free time?",0,persuade_corpus,,1

C3549BC956DC," A positive attitude is a powerful tool that can greatly impact one's success in life. While it is true that some people still make mistakes, regardless of their attitude, I believe that having a positive attitude is still the key to achieving success.

It is true that some people may have different personalities that affect their attitudes, but I believe that everyone has the ability to adopt a positive attitude. Having a positive attitude can help individuals overcome obstacles and challenges that they may encounter in their lives.

While it is true that negative attitudes can make it difficult to be happy with life, I believe that it is not always the case. Sometimes, good things can happen to people with negative attitudes, and they can still find happiness in their lives.

In my opinion, having a positive attitude can bring many benefits, including increased motivation, better decision-making, and improved relationships with others. It can also help individuals to maintain a sense of hope and optimism, which can lead to greater success in their personal and professional lives.

30da029c,"From riding horses with wagons to, driving cars. this has been a big impact on everyones life. some people drive their cars to get place to place. Others either ride a bike or even they walk to get to where they need to be. In other words some people use cars and some people dont have the money to or just dont want to. So the question remains does not having cars have a affect on our lifes?

Perhaps people think that everyone in the world needs a car that is not true. For example:In the article Heidrun Walter said that""When i had a car i was always so tense. Im much happier this way."" He said this because he even moved to Vauban where 70% of the families do not own cars and 57% sold their cars to move there. my next example will be by David Goldberg he says: ""all of our development since wwe has been centered on the car, and that will have to change. And i think he is right most people in the world are focused on what kind of car to get and how much they cost. Well maybe we as the people should spent a little less time on cars and a little more on how to better the economy.

Next, In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Because if this happening it will end up that the world will have less accidents on the roads and highways so that means that we will have less people dying becaues of the accidents. For my next example: Vauban homes are 5500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for paking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

The other way to look at it is that hw are people going to get to work? How are they going to get to the store? Well how are people going to do all these thinds if the dont have a car. If all the car in the world was banned that woould be a bad idea because people would have to star knowing all of the bus,train and subway scheduals so that they would be able to get to work on time. But if they had a car they would not have to do all of that they would just get in to their car and go. Another reason what if you miss your ride to work and your already late then you would have to make a choice to either what for another bus or walk to work either way you are going to end up be late to work. this plan only works if everything that you want and need are very close to where you live and most of the time everything that we want and need are not even close to where we live and way to far to walk.

People all over the world depend a lot on cars but we shouldnt. A lot of time i think that people in america are just being lazy. If you think about it if we take all the cars away then we wouldnt have to pay for gas,insurance, or for that matter buy a car. If we do this everything would be much closer together and it would be in walkin distance and you would be able to save a lot of money.",0,train_essays,,8
10235460,"While many may argue for it, the Electoral College has proved to be an obsolete way of electing the President. It is, essentially, an indirect way for voters to choose their candidates, by voting for electors whose loyalty is not guaranteed. The Electoral College vote can override the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 Presidential Election. Some say that the Electoral College is a system worth keeping, because it provides a certain outcome and avoids runoff elections, yet these arguments are founded on little reason.

Undoubtedly outdated, this system is a catastrophe in the works, the 2000 election only a glimpse of the chaos that could result from the Electoral College. The disaster factor is a strong argument against the Electoral College. Consider 1960, when Louisiana segregationists came close to replacing Democratic electors with ones who wouldn't support Kennedy 11. Also along those lines, electors are bound by nothing but obligation to vote for the candidate of their party, and sometimes change their decision upon voting. Even if it only happens occasionally, it is yet another fault in this system.

Not only is the Electoral College irrational, it is also simply unfair. Each state can only cast a single vote, so the one representative in Wyoming, who represents only 500 thousand, would have as much say as California's 55 representatives, who represent 35 million voters 12. Other sources say a tie would be unlikely. However, in 1979 in Ohio, it would have only taken a few thousand voters to vote the other way 12. Because of the ""winnertakeall"" system, certain states are left untouched by candidates who know they won't win them. In 2000, certain states didn't even see the candidates, and didn't air campaign ads, denying voters of a chance to further favor or favor them 13.

It is simple, the Electoral College system is a turnoff for many voters, especially after the incident in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote. Voters can be discouraged if they have no hope of carrying their state, like Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in Cali 23. Assuming that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election 23"" is rather incorrect. Single votes could absolutely sway an election, as mentioned earlier. Relying on the popular vote may make a tie more likely, but it would free voters from an obsolete and untrustworthy system. Over 60 percent of voters oppose the Electoral College 9 which is enough to bring attention to these facts and, hopefully, address them before another controversial occurance.

The evidence is all layed out, mishaps and nearmishaps, an impending catastrophe all too possible for comfort, unfair to potential voters. The Electoral College doesn't deserve its defenders. 2000 proved it, the voters have spoken up, and it is indisputably irrational to continue to rely on it. The system has been around for a while, and it will stay in place for the next few years, most likely. However, because of the light now being shined on its faults, it could have a chance to be reformed for the better.",0,train_essays,,0
BF72FB4B953F,"Three year graduation

Is it beneficial for students to graduate a year earlier then the rest or could graduating earlier impact a student's health? Many high schools allow students to choose between graduating in three years or the traditional four years. Some students accept this offer with the idea of leaving early and not dealing with drama. In my opinion early graduation is not worth the mental, physical, and emotional stress.

To start off, when you choose to graduate within three years you are choosing to work during summer and do all core classes for junior and senior year in one semester. you worry so much whether you are going to pass or not here is where stress applies. Generic_Name, a college student at John Tyler community college, was suppose to have graduated last year skipping her fourth year but, unfortunately she couldn't keep up with everything. She had to do all her junior classes in one semester and her senior classes during second semester causing her to stress and have a mental breakdown in the middle of her Biology class. After consulting with her guidance counselor she came to the conclusion that she will have to do her fourth year of high school for her mental health's sake.

Now with that being said, transitioning from junior to senior year is hectic. You have to make sure you have enough credits to continue: make sure you keep up with all your classes and their requirements: and you have to stay up late studying and doing homework. A young adult needs at least 8 to 7 hours of sleep to properly function through out the day. A student that stays up doing late night homework and studying do not obtain most of those hours leaving them with only 2 to 3 hours to sleep;therefore causing them to be tired all day long the next day. The lack of sleep has a big impact on a student who wants to graduate early, for they fall asleep in class and miss out on important notes.

In addition, the simple attempt to graduate is emotionally stressful. Now imagine only having one year to do both junior and senior classes. Once again you worry about passing but this time you question yourself. You ask yourself "" Am I capable of making it? and Am I smart enough?"" and dwell on these questions. Eventually you start putting yourself down and start thinking whether you made the right choice or not. This is where your emotions come in to play. Meanwhile you are trying your hardest to do all your work you start feeling angry at yourself because you simply can not keep up. Soon enough you give up on everything your education and most importantly your future.

On the contrast, for many high school students graduation is an exit ticket. The faster we manage to graduate the better. We no longer have to wake up early in the mornings, we do not have to interact with students and their negative attitudes, and we no longer have to be caught up in high school drama. but even though graduating early seems glorious it is not worth all the emotional, mental, and physical stress of doing both years in one semester.

In conclusion, three year graduation is more than just saying "" let's do it!"". It takes away from your sleeping schedule; stressing you out when you fall asleep in class and fail to copy notes. Causes you to worry so much whether you are going to pass or not and mentally stress. you eventually start to question yourself, feel insecure and emotionally stressed. Graduating early seems glorious but once again it is not worth all the stress.",0,original_moth,"Task:

Some students could struggle with verbally expressing their emotion's making it hard for their teacher/learning coach to know the most successful way to teach them.

A8D0ADC676C0,"As an eighth-grade student, I have learned the importance of seeking multiple opinions when making decisions. In my experience, seeking multiple opinions can help me make better decisions by preventing poor choices, determining which advice is accurate, and helping to ensure comfort with decisions.

Firstly, seeking multiple opinions can help me prevent poor choices. When I seek out different perspectives, I am able to consider a variety of factors that may not have been immediately apparent to me. This allows me to make more informed decisions and avoid choices that may have negative consequences. For example, if I am deciding on a new hobby, seeking the opinions of friends and family can help me determine which hobbies are appropriate for my interests and skill level.

Secondly, seeking multiple opinions can help me determine which advice is accurate. When I seek out different perspectives, I am able to compare and contrast the advice I receive. This allows me to determine which advice is most relevant and reliable. For example, if I am deciding on a college major, seeking the opinions of teachers, peers, and career counselors can help me determine which majors are most suitable for my interests and career goals.

Lastly, seeking multiple opinions can help me ensure comfort with my decisions. When I seek out different perspectives, I am able to gain a better understanding of the potential consequences of my decisions. This allows me to feel more confident in my choices and less likely to regret them. For example, if I am deciding on a new job opportunity, seeking the opinions of colleagues and friends can help me understand the company culture and determine if it is a good fit for me.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is an important aspect of making better decisions. By preventing poor choices, determining which advice is accurate, and ensuring comfort with decisions, seeking multiple opinions can help me make more informed and confident choices. I encourage others to seek out different perspectives when making decisions, as it can lead to better outcomes and a greater sense of satisfaction.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,2
CAC2F2EE4C2D,"Being an actively engaged student is an essential aspect of academic success and personal growth. By actively engaging in the learning process, students can improve their future prospects in various ways. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of being an actively engaged student and how it can positively impact a person's future.

Firstly, being an actively engaged student can lead to better academic performance. When students actively engage in the learning process, they are more likely to understand the material, retain information, and apply it in their studies. This can result in higher grades, test scores, and overall academic success. In turn, this success can lead to better college admission opportunities, scholarships, and financial aid.

Secondly, actively engaged students are more likely to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By actively engaging in the learning process, students are exposed to different perspectives and ideas, which can help them develop their own opinions and ideas. This exposure to diverse viewpoints can also help students identify and analyze problems, leading to better decision-making and problem-solving skills. These skills are highly valued by employers and can lead to better job opportunities and career advancement.

Thirdly, being an actively engaged student can lead to improved social and emotional development. When students actively engage in the learning process, they are more likely to develop strong relationships with their peers and teachers. These relationships can help students build self-confidence, develop communication skills, and improve their overall emotional well-being. These skills are essential for personal and professional success and can help students navigate social situations and relationships more effectively.

In conclusion, being an actively engaged student has numerous benefits that can positively impact a person's future prospects. By actively engaging in the learning process, students can improve their academic performance, develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and improve their social and emotional development. These benefits can lead to better college admission opportunities, better job opportunities, and overall personal and professional success.

9145AB74E1DA,"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Working from home or in school, which is better for students? This is a question that has been debated for a long time. Personally, I think it's better to work from home. Here's why.

First of all, it's way easier to access resources when you're at home. You don't have to worry about getting to the library or finding a computer lab. You can just use your own laptop or computer and look up whatever you need. Plus, you can work in your pajamas if you want to! ð´

Another thing is that you can work at your own pace when you're at home. Sometimes in school, you can get stuck on a problem and you don't know how to move forward. But when you're at home, you can take your time and figure it out without feeling rushed. And you can also take breaks whenever you want, like when you need to go get a snack or play with your pet. ð¶

But on the other hand, some people say that it's better to work in school because you can learn from other people. When you're in class, you can ask questions and get help from your teacher or other students. And you can also learn from other people's ideas and perspectives. It's like a big brainstorming session! ð¡

However, I think that's not always the case. Sometimes, you can learn more from working on your own because you can focus better. And you can also learn new things on your own time, like when you're bored or have nothing else to do. ð¤

In conclusion, working from home is better for students because it's easier to access resources and you can work at your own pace. But working in school can be better too because you can learn from other people. So, it's not really better or worse, it's just different. ð¤·ââï¸

We are facing the challenge of Venus, it is really valued not only because of the facts and information we get out of this planet. Instead, humans are curiose and looking for more evidence of what we are going to face in the futur. We should learn more not only on the outter shell, but more deeply in the inside.

Venus is the second planet in the our solar system(Milkyway). Also ot is one of the brightest points in the sky at night. As the closest plant to Earth in terms of size, density, and distane. The surface of it is full with valleys, mountains, and craters. Not even one single spacecraft have reached to it before. 97 percent of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, forming a blanket for the planet. This planet has the highest temperature in the whole entire Milkyway. NASA(National Aeronautics and Space Administration) have not stop sending spacecraft to land on Venus.

If we could lend on Venus later on in the generation, could there be any living organisum that lives on that plante? There could be a possible chance since Earth is not the only planet in space. There are more things tha we need to discover. You would never know if there are creatures like ous that have a abiliy to explore space.

0F13AFF35C0C,"Why is it more beneficial to seek multiple opinions when making a decision? When people ask for advice, they are usually conflicted about something, or don't know what to do. The reason that one person asks for advice could be because they don't know what shoes to wear, or it could be because they need advice about something bigger, like what house to buy. Either way, they are still seeking other people's opinions. When you are asking a person for advice, you want a definite answer. You could ask one person for advice about what shoes to wear, and they could say black, and then you could ask someone else for advice about the same thing, and they could say a different answer. The reason You shouldn't base your decision off of just one person's opinion, is because their opinion is very different than someone else's opinion.

For example, if you were debating between which outfit you should wear, you would most likely ask for other people's opinions. Seeking multiple people's opinion would be much more accurate and beneficial to you, because then you would have more than just one person's thoughts and opinions to base your decision off of. You could ask one person for their advice on which outfit you should wear, and they would say one answer, and then you could ask for someone else's opinion on what outfit you should wear, and they could say a completely different answer. However, when you ask multiple people for their opinions, you are getting a much more accurate response. If you were to ask ten people for their advice on which outfit you should wear, and eight people said one outfit and two people said a different outfit, chances are you would wear the outfit that eight people chose.

Another example of how seeking multiple people's advice can help you make a better decision is If you were debating whether or not to end a friendship. You would most likely want your other friends advice on what to do. Chances are you would go to multiple different friends and ask them for advice on what to do. If you were to just ask for one of your friends opinions, it would be less accurate than asking for five of your friends opinions. Your one friend that you asked could be prejudice against your other friend, and give you a false, or bias, opinion. However, when you ask multiple friends for their opinion, you get to hear all their opinions, and have a reliable source to base your decision off of.

In conclusion, when you are seeking advice, it is much more beneficial for you to seek multiple people's opinions instead of just one person's opinion. It is more accurate, beneficial, reliable, and shows you what the majority of people think. It also gives you a definite answer, instead of just one person's thoughts. It also stops you from making a bias, or prejudice, decision. It shows you what the majority of people think, and lets you hear from everyone. From seeking advice on something as small as what shoes to wear, or as big as what house to buy, you should always seek multiple people's opinion instead of just one person's.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
16BF09110617,"Is using a computer that reads people emotion called Facial Action Coding should be used of students in class. I Think IT should to show if the student is going trough some hard times and may need some help.

Onereason is that students dont know how to handle things thy can get caught up in soem things that can effect them long term. Some student may come to school and get bullyed and they might not know how to handle something like that and wind up getting hurt because they wont speak up. In stead of talking to a teacher about it they get in to fights and no one will want to hire them and they wind up on the streets with no jod.

Another reason is that people may have trouble with money at home and it would help to talk to them about that because they might try to steal and get arrested for it and wind up in jail when they could have better things to do. there dad might be a drunk and beat him when he is drunk so using this machine we could see the proublems they have and help them with it.

One last reason is people need to get out and see the world and find new things. you never know they might like what they see and want to find a job like this one reading people emotione.

CE11907D971D,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student on the topic of how technology can affect people's lives or human contact:

Technology is something that has been a part of our lives for a long time now. From smartphones to laptops, and from social media to online gaming, technology has made our lives a lot easier in many ways. But, have you ever thought about how technology can affect our lives and human contact?

Well, let me tell you, it can have both positive and negative effects. On one hand, technology can help us stay connected with our friends and family who live far away. With video calls and messaging apps, we can see each other's faces and have conversations like we were in the same room. This can be especially helpful for people who have to move away for work or school.

On the other hand, technology can also make us less likely to have face-to-face interactions with people. For example, if we're always on our phones or computers, we might not make an effort to talk to people around us. This can lead to a lack of social skills and a sense of isolation.

Another thing that technology can do is make us feel like we're always ""on"" and available to everyone. With constant notifications and messages, it can be hard to disconnect and have some alone time. This can be stressful and can make us feel like we're constantly running on a hamster wheel.

In my opinion, it's important to find a balance between technology and human contact. We need to make sure that we're not letting technology take over our lives and that we're still making time for face-to-face interactions with the people around us. This can help us stay connected with the world and with each other in a more meaningful way.

In conclusion, technology can have both positive and negative effects on our lives and human contact. It's important to be aware of these effects and to find a balance between technology and face-to-face interactions. By doing this, we can make sure that we're using technology in a way that enhances our lives, rather than taking away from them.",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay exploring how technology can effect people's lives or human contact.,4

ed842ad6,"Cars have been around since the early 1900's, but now it seems there is no need for them. The younger generations have not been getting drivers licences and technology is making it easier to ride with someone else or telework. It is an all out war against automobiles and the United States isn't the only one fighting in it. Vauban, Germany, bogota, Columbia, and Paris, France have all joined the war against personal cars.

How to win a war against cars stop owning them. Vauban, Germany's population is doing just that. Over half of vaughn's population sold theirs cars so they could live in Vauban, and over seventy percent don't own a car. If people don't own cars, then there is no need for parking. Now, without parking lots or garages all over the place stores and schools can be closer to home. For those that require a car to get to a farther away work there are two parking garages, but to own a spot in one of them one you must buy a home there and pay forty thousand for the parking space. Residents of this experiment have even gone to say that without a vehicle they are less stressed and happier.

Joy was not what Paris commuters felt when France closed down the streets to certain vehicles for one week. Why would they close the streets smog bad enough to rival one of the most polluted cities in the world. Paris is usually the European city that has all the smog, 147 micrograms to London's 79.7. So the government decided to do something about it. For five days they alternated from even licensedplate cars could drive to odd licensedplate cars could drive. To appease everyone without cars the government made public transportation completly free allowing those without vehicles to still get to where they needed to go.

In the war against cars public transportation has played a big role. Take the city of bogota, Colombia for example every year they have a completly car free day where everyone takes public transportation or walks. Due to the day without cars public transportation is better than ever, as are the sidewalks. Busses have nicer interiors and are more accomodating, and old, cracked sidewalks have turned into smooth, flat sidewalks that are safer for everyone.

Some might say that it is impossible to live without cars, because of illnesses and the lack of safety. However, in Vuaban, Germany people are less stressed which acounts for many immune systems shutting down. In Paris, France they were able to clear their city of smog in five days, without smog there would be nothing to hide the sun on a nice day letting people get vitamen C also while keeping their lungs clear. In bogota, Colombia public transpotation and sidewalks have improved tenfold since the day without cars started as has safety. Without cars there are no accidents, people cannot injure others by drunk or reckless driving, and it allows the police to watch for crime instead of speeders.

falcon_180b_v1_1006,"I am against the development of driverless cars. While they may seem like a cool and futuristic idea, they could potentially do more harm than good.

One reason I am against driverless cars is because they could result in job loss. The article states that âtruck driving is the most common job in 29 of 50 U.S. states,â and if driverless cars become the norm, many truck drivers could lose their jobs. This would be a major setback for the economy and for those who rely on these jobs to support themselves and their families.

Another reason I am against driverless cars is because they could be dangerous. The article mentions a study that found that âdriverless cars were more likely to cause accidents than human-driven cars,â which is concerning. While technology is constantly improving, there is still a risk involved when it comes to relying on machines to drive us around.

And though this was my dream college, only my baby sister, Generic_Name, stood behind me, squealing with joy, even though she had no idea what this meant. Yes, my parents disapprove, when I told them I applied, their smiles quickly turned to frowns. I picked Generic_Name up, kissing her cool forehead. Her flowing pink dress twirled as I ran her around the room on my back. All my friends hate the fact that I'm going to a 'party school' and say that I can do better. Doubt then sped through my mind, like the traffic on an early Friday morning. Maybe I shouldn't go there, it is far from home. Why would I ask for my parent's approval and not take their advice? I didn't apply anywhere else, I was so certain that I would make it to this one school. The school that requires as low as Cs, when I get all As. The door squeaks open, and I see my mother smiling, holding her arms across her stomach awkwardly. ""You made it, I'm so proud"" She said gently. ""I'm going to apply somewhere else, somewhere more my level, like Harvard maybe?"" I said. ""That's my girl, I knew you would come around"" She said, as she wrapped her arms around me. Seeking multiple people's opinions helps someone to make a better choice because you can see other's views and they can help you realize something you didn't before.

Seeking multiple people's opinions helps you to make a better choice because you can see other's views. What you might not know about someone is what they've experienced. Especially if they're older. They could have made the wrong decision and help you to make the right one. I used to read a lot of books like that when I was little, and sometimes I still do. They're all about this one character that has an awful choice to make, and then lots of people guide them to make the right one. In the end, it's all happily ever after. Making a life-changing decision, like the college you go to, your career, where you live, sometimes it helps to ask the people that are closest to you. Ask them how they think you will change. They've known you their whole life. If you change, you won't realize it because you adjusted to your new self. For them, you may be a whole new person.

Seeking multiple people's opinions helps you to make a better choice because you could realize something that you didn't before. You know how in those cheesy movies someone always is faced with two options, and somehow they always makes the right one? It's because the smart on of the group realizes that exploding the whole universe would actually be worse then just planting a tree outside. Yep, it takes a whole 90 minutes for them to find that out. Or in those scienceÂ movies that splitting an atom has a nuclear reaction? They find out the outcome and save the world. Let's use Jurassic World as an example. In the movie, they find out that the dinosaur is able to hide from thermal cameras, they find that out to late, SWAT is looking for ways the dino could've escaped in the cage and BAM. The dinosaur jumps from the leaves and swallows the men and women whole. At leastÂ now they know the dinosaur can hide from thermal cameras right? One step closer then before.

So whenever you're sitting on your couch, wondering why these people can't make the decision to plant the tree instead of blowing up the world, or you're sitting in front of your computer, scrolling through homes that could possibly be yours, ask others, like multiple people, what they they think. They could spot a rat in the corner of the house that you enjoyed so much, and guide you to purchase the next one, even though the walls are beige.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

Seeking advice from more than one person can help the type of situation your are in, or if you need help on something than people can give advice on what you need. Multiple options to choose from is better because some people will probably have the same advice. Each piece of advice will work differently depending on the type of situation

Asking more than one person for opinions will have a lot of different thoughts, and opinions will also help because it will tell you what other people think of what ever situation you are in. Opinions are different then advice because advice is something that the person giving it may have had experience before, and opinions is what someone thinks.

In conclusion advice and opinions are helpful because you can have an idea of what to do when it is needed.   Â  Â  Â Â    Â  Â  Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
A72F4E50ED92," Working in groups is a crucial aspect of life, both in personal and professional settings. When working in a group, individuals have the opportunity to share their thoughts and ideas before starting a project, which can lead to more creative solutions and better outcomes. Additionally, group work helps individuals learn how to communicate effectively with others, which is essential for success in any field.

One of the main advantages of working in a group is the ability to collaborate and share ideas. By working together, individuals can generate more ideas and come up with solutions that may not have been possible if they had worked alone. This can lead to more innovative and creative solutions to problems. Furthermore, group work can help individuals learn how to work with others, which is a valuable skill in any setting.

Group work also helps individuals learn how to communicate effectively. When working in a group, individuals must learn how to express their ideas clearly and listen to the ideas of others. This can help individuals develop strong communication skills, which are essential for success in any field. Additionally, group work can help individuals learn how to work with others who have different working styles and perspectives, which is a valuable skill in any setting.

First failure gives us the corrage to try something over and over until you gat it because, I have fail before when I was trying out for the school soccer team, I work so hard for it I go to training everytime, and be there on time but i did not made the team I was so sad that i did not made the team but it give me the corrage to try more and more.

88776F4CE3D1,"Sometimes classrooms can be very confusing to both teachers and students. With new computer software that can recognize emotions, the classroom environment can be greatly improved. The computer is able to detect a variety of different emotions from surprise and sadness. This advanced technology can help with students who are afraid of asking a question they think is dumb, students who don't care enough to ask questions, teachers detecting if a student is lying and exercises that have students fake emotions until they become real. The use of this technology would change students' and teachers' school experience.

A quote by Prof. Thomas Huang says, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" With the Facial Action Coding System, computers would be very useful in the classroom because many students are to afraid to ask questions, or they just don't care enough to ask questions. With thid new software computers can detect when a student isn't understanding the concept, bored of the lesson or completely zoned out. The teacher can also be aware of the class weaknesses and strengths. Knowing this feedback would create a better learning environment for the student and teacher.

Going along with the idea of technology that reads your emotions, according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them. This exercise can be significant in the classroom by having the students fake emotions until the emotions become genuine. If students simply do smiling exercises before a test it could possibly relieve potential nerves, resulting in better test scores. This exercise could also be used when they are being taught a lesson. The student could practice a serious face multiple times until they feel serious enough to focus on the lesson. Advanced computers can read these emotions and detect whether these exercises were beneficial.

""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" - Since this statement can be used during scenarios including politicians, it can be applied to everyday situations like students in a classroom. Things like cheating on tests, plagiarism and lying about getting work done in time are all common practices done by many students. With the use of the advanced technology, teachers can detect whenever either of those happen, thus bettering the student in the long run. This can also result in students never doing these things again because they know they will get caught.

All of these claims are evidence that advanced technology would be very valuable in a classroom setting. If every school had these computers, the teachers' and students' learning environment would immensely improve. From knowing if a student is lying or not to teachers being able to better their lesson plans, this technology can do it all. Every schools' test scores would go up. Although this software is way beyond our time and a little too much to ask for, it would make school a better place.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars."" Garvin also said about the Face. Natural landforms are usually formed by Natural events. Probably the same thing that happened on Mars. When Mars Gloval Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, it snaped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking pictures and all it revealed was a natural landform, no alien monument. Although some said that the alien markings might have been hidden by haze, there still was no alien markings to be found after the next picture they took on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. It was the best 1976 Viking photo and still no sightings of life on Mars.

I do too think there might be forms of life or ""aliens"" on other planets but just maybe not Mars. After all, Mars is not completly suitiable for life to live on even though its called Earths twin.

32926CBD644F,"It is August 5th and my friend Generic_Name can not hang out today, and I am pretty sad about that. If only he had chosen an easier topic for his summer project, and done it earlier. Although some believe otherwise students should be able to design their own project, because they will have the creativity factors that controlled projects would not, they can choose their own subject, and they have an increased growth in responsibility.

Us students love the creativity aspect of getting to choose how we get to work. We hate being bound to guidelines and rules set by other people. Whenever I get to choose how I do my projects I always seem to do better on them when I get to be more creative. A couple of months ago, my AP Environmental sciences teacher let us choose an end of year project. She said ""as long as you get it in on time, I do not care what or how you do it. The project just has to pertain towards some of the topics that we learn during the course."" I loved getting that freedom from her, because I got to do it how I wanted and I got to be more creative with it too. I ended turning in that project within a month, because it was something that I wanted to do. If I was bound to the rules I would have procrastinated until the night before it was due. Some may disagree, saying that they are more likely to do the project when guidelines are given and when students are forced not to be creative. That reasoning is flawed due to the fact that my friend Generic_Name was given a similar project, but with guidelines saying the stuff that she could and could not do. She has always been better than me at turning in assignments. When I found out that I had turned in my project before her ,I was astonished. I asked her why she had not not done yet. She said that she had not even figured out what she was going to do. She was bound to do what she was told to do and she lost the creativity factor that she has always loved. Creativity is vital to a students success when doing projects. It ensured that every project is different and more entertaining than traditional projects.

Getting to choose a subject also makes the project more enjoyable for the students. If students were given a choice to select a subject that they would do a summer project on, they would most likely choose the subject that they feel more confidentÂ in. My mother always says that she loved to do projects on history (which was her favorite subject when she was in high school). She said that whenever she would get to do a project on it she would get A's and B's every time, but she would get C's on other projects that was not on her favorite subject. This choice in subjects was a morale booster for her. When she got good grades she got more confident and when she got more confident she got better grades. The choice correlated with her mental health and her school life, because she always felt good about her work.

Some say that if we get assigned a subject then we will be more likelyÂ to do what the person who grades is looking for. That is not the case, because of my friend Generic_Name. Generic_Name had to do a summer project last year and he had no idea what to do. He calledÂ me an asked what my project was on. I told him that me and just about everyone in our friend group was doing our project on History. When the school year started I asked him what he did it on, and he said his project was on Economics. When we got our grades back he had gotten the highest out of all of our friends. This just shows that it is more likely for someone to get a better grade when they get to choose a project subject or topic that they enjoy to do.

In our youthful society responsibility is a huge part of maturing. Getting to choose a project makes kids more responsible in the long run. This past weekend my parents left me home while they went to go watch my sister play lacrosse at Generic_School in Rhode Island. I stayed home with my dog and had a lot of time to myself and to my studies. I could have pushed it off until Sunday night, but I decided to do the responsible thing and do it during the day on Saturday. The choice I made was the right one, because I had the rest of the weekend to myself and got to relax and not stress about having to do my homework. If I can choose to be responsible now then I can be responsible when it comes to a summer project. I think that growth in responsibility will also have a great effect on everyone that does this project. The responsible person would choose to do the project earlier in the summer, but the kids that procrastinate will stress about this until the day before the project is due. Some think that responsibility has nothing to do with this project, that is not true.Â We are trusted to be responsible young men, women, or however people identify themselves. This project is not just about learning at school, but learning about life. When given the choice to do the project how we want to do it responsibility plays a huge factor. Factors like: Will we get it done on time, how will we do it, what topic will we do it on, and if the project actually had time spent on it or if it was just sped through. Us students need to be responsible in order to get in to good colleges, get good jobs, and live good lives. It all starts with projects like these. When all of these factors are put together they are more likely to make us more responsible in the long run.

When we get to choose what we do for projects like these it makes everyone feel good about what they are turning in. It could be the coffee in my system talking, but us students have responsibilities and we need to start being trusted and treated like adults. We want to be creative like adults, think like adults, and live like adults. It all starts with letting us choose a subject for our projects. After all we are the future of society.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
60ED0B48B8F2,"Being alone in the world can be a daunting and overwhelming experience. It can be difficult to navigate the challenges and obstacles that come with it, and it can be even harder to find meaning and purpose in life without the help and support of others. However, Ralph Waldo Emerson's works suggest that it is possible to do something meaningful in the world, even when you are alone.

Emerson believed that self-reliance and individualism were key to finding meaning and purpose in life. He argued that people should rely on their own inner resources and talents, rather than relying on others for validation and approval. By doing so, they could find a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that could not be achieved through external validation.

One of Emerson's most famous quotes, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail,"" encapsulates this idea. By blazing your own trail and forging your own path in life, you can find meaning and purpose that is unique to you. This can be particularly challenging when you are alone, as you may not have the same level of support and guidance that you would have if you were surrounded by others.

However, Emerson's works also suggest that being alone can be a valuable and enriching experience. He believed that solitude could provide a space for introspection and self-reflection, allowing individuals to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world. By spending time alone, individuals can also develop their own unique perspective and worldview, which can be a valuable asset in a world that is often dominated by groupthink and conformity.

In conclusion, being alone in the world can be a challenging and overwhelming experience, but Ralph Waldo Emerson's works suggest that it is possible to find meaning and purpose in life, even when you are alone. By relying on their own inner resources and talents, individuals can blaze their own trail and find a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that is unique to them.

We need to change it from the Electoral college to the most popular vote for the president of th Unitd States of America. Because whats the point of all of our parents and alot of other adults of voting if we can't even get what we want but no it's all up to the electors and congress, ect. like for real what is the point in voting if it isn't a fair shot.

Now that I've read it we don't even vote for the prsident we vote for the slate of electorswho in turn elect the president. Whom are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depnds on the state sometimes state conventions sometimes the stateparty's centeral committee sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for ? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate? Sometimes.

At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. And dont likethat because the what the heck is happening if were not acktually voting for the president and just the electors. Like for real then whats the point of voting if were not getting what we want. When the goverment is all about giveing the people what they want. Like why can't they just let the people vote for the people the want to vote for like for real. This sucks that we can't get wht we deserve.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

If the car doors are locked and there is no way to get out in a crash, there will be more of a chance of people dieing from a car crash than before the cars come out.

""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rahter hide, say conspiracy theorist."" Yet the article goes on th say ""Few scientis belebed that Face was an alien artifact..."" This means that many scientiss knew that the Face was a landform form the very beginning but only used it to get money for NASA to research more about Mars. Not only this but the weather was not an ideal time for the image to be taken.

When the image was taken it was at a certain time, year, and season. "" this on had unusual shadows..."" means that the sun was not hitting it deredctly to elliminate any shawdows that were there. ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north...where it was winter in April'98-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Plant.""

EBD07D2D103C,"In recent years, there has been a growing debate about the benefits of traditional classroom learning versus distance learning. While both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, I believe that traditional classroom learning is the better option for most students. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the two methods, list the pros and cons of each, and analyze how traditional classroom learning provides a better learning system for some students.

Traditional classroom learning provides a structured and disciplined learning environment that is conducive to effective learning. Students are required to attend class at specific times and are expected to complete assignments and participate in class discussions. This structure helps students stay on track and motivated to learn. In contrast, distance learning allows students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. While this flexibility can be beneficial for some students, it can also lead to procrastination and a lack of discipline.

One of the main advantages of traditional classroom learning is the opportunity for face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers. Teachers can provide immediate feedback and guidance, and peers can offer support and collaboration. This interaction can help students understand the material better and develop important social skills. Distance learning, on the other hand, relies heavily on technology and can feel isolating for some students.

Another benefit of traditional classroom learning is the ability to participate in group activities. Group projects and discussions can help students develop teamwork and communication skills, as well as provide opportunities for collaboration and problem-solving. While distance learning can also include group activities, the lack of face-to-face interaction can make it more difficult for students to work together effectively.

In conclusion, while distance learning has its advantages, traditional classroom learning provides a more structured and disciplined learning environment that is conducive to effective learning. The face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers, as well as the ability to participate in group activities, can help students understand the material better and develop important social skills. While distance learning may be a better option for some students, traditional classroom learning should remain the primary method of education for most.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,4
8C83ACEF2A15," I believe that some high schools offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years instead of four, which is a great option for those who may not have the financial means or desire to attend college. These students may be able to find full-time employment and contribute to their families' financial stability or even move out and start living independently. Additionally, teenagers who graduate early may be more mature and better prepared for the challenges of adulthood.

In today's job market, employers are looking for young adults with experience. If students graduate in three years, they will have the opportunity to gain valuable work experience in a short amount of time. This can be especially beneficial for those who are interested in pursuing careers in fields such as food service or retail, where they can gain hands-on experience and develop important skills.

On the other hand, some teenagers may prefer to attend college or university to pursue specific careers or interests. This option allows them to graduate at a more traditional age, with more time, energy, and focus to dedicate to their studies. By attending college or university, they will also have the opportunity to network with professionals in their field and gain access to valuable resources and support.

Ultimately, the decision to graduate in three years or pursue higher education is a personal one and should be based on individual goals and circumstances. However, I believe that both options have their advantages and can be beneficial for students who are willing to put in the effort and make the most of their education.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

84305C417C4B,"Extracurricular activities should be mandatoryÂ because kids could look forward to activities after school instead of going home and sitting around for hours.Â It would help kids stay out of trouble, keep students active, and help students build a social life.

Making students stay after schoolÂ would help them stay out of trouble. Most students parents have and office job. The average work time is from 9am to 5pm, and school gets out at around 2pm- 4pm, so most kids are left unsupervised for around 2-6 hours. Kids left alone can get into all sorts of trouble and can be persuaded to do things that they know they should not do. Kids can be convinced to do drugs, join gangs, and vandalize public property. Instead of doing these things they can be supervised at school doing something that is fun and enjoyable instead of being mischievous. The school environment would be much safer because students wouldnt be influenced be other people to do any bad things, so they would not be doing or selling drugs and they would not be in or associatedÂ with a gang. Therefore, students would not bring in bad things into our schools. Making students stay after school would help them stay out of trouble, and stay good people.

The second reason that students should have to participate in an after school activities is because it is a way to get kids out of the house and encourage them to do something with their lives. Some kids go home and play sports outside or play a game with their siblings, but most kids go home and play video games for 5 hours till they have to eat dinner or go to bed. This is very unhealthy. An extracurricular activity would get a person who usually plays lots of video games to do something active. They could play sports after school and they would still have time for video games. Playing sports after school could convince them to play sports for fun, not because they have to do something after school and they could join a league and exercise more than just after school. This would help kids stay active and healthy. After school activities for all people is a good idea because it would help kids stay active and healthy.

Finally, making kids stay after school would help students build a social life. During the school day some kids do not socialize with others because they are tired, shy, or they are very focused on academics. After school, activities would really help kids gain a social life. After school activities are laid back and are made too do something active after school, not to secretly trick kids into too staying an extra hour after school. The activities after school are fun, they are meant to be. Kids after school who are shy can communicate with others because the activities give them ways to start of conversations and communicate with others.

In conclusion, Extracurricular activities should be mandatory. This would help kids stay out of trouble because it would keep them doing something healthy instead of something mischievous. It would students kids stay healthy because it would force them to do something active. and finally, it would help students because it would help students gain a social life because they could communicate with others.

Also my personal preference is to get everybody's opinion before doing something that will impact me. For example, one day I was very sick and asked if I should go to school or not my mom and my sister told me to go to school.

Another reason is that if you really want to do something that's not right you can get some other opinion's and see if you should do it or not. Like if your going to do something bad your friends or family can talk you out of doing it. There was one time that I really wanted to do something, but I knew it was notÂ the right thing to do, I told my family about it and they talked to me about it.

5A91E373F462,"Dear Principal,

I understand your reasoning in wanting us students to do community service, But quiet frankly, we have enough things to do. I know that community service is a good thing to do but we also need to look out for ourselves. We have schoolwork that needs to be completed, extracurricular activities to do, and chores back home that need to be completed, we just wouldn't have enough time!

Our schoolwork is a major priority to us children. We need to complete it so that we can understand things so we can grow up to get a good college, and have a good future. Our parents and even you put enough stress on us about these things so why would you go ahead and give us more things to do when we already have a lot of stress on our backs. We have about 7 class a day all which assign at least 30 to 45 minutes of hard core studying and working. Multiply that by 7 and you get about 4 to 5 hours of homework per night. sure that's not every night but when it is its hard. This leads me in another reason why this extra chore is unnecessary.

Sports! Clubs! we have these thing too you know. and after our 8 hours of school add this on and it almost makes it 12 hours. plus our homework, do you really think that we would have enough tine to waltz out into the wilderness and pick up trash every day for another 2?!!?! When someone joins a sports team they make a commitment to do their best and try hard. How hard do you think we could try when we are tired from working every day?? This inst a jail, we have enough stuff to do that can fill up our day. And quiet frankly i don't think that any one would even participate in this even if it was required, it is just to much of a burden on us students.

We also have to go home and do some choirs, foils some laundry, take a shower, and eat. That to takes up another hour, lets add it up 8 hours at school 2 hours at sports 2 at community service (which is what you want)

That's already 13 hours of the day, and who knows, maybe someone had more things to do, like sports out of school, or scouts, or dance. The possibility are endless and adding this could makes someone day could make it torturous. This also leaves us no down time to read, relax, or watch T.V.

Please Mr. Principal please do not add anything new to our requirements for school, we have enough stuff to do and we don't need to come to school back to back exhausted from doing sports, chores, work, and school work.

0B5BC07C6E03,"Every school should have a principle authority figure, otherwise who or how would schools maintain in safety, cleanliness, and education wise, but doesn't mean that they have all authority, to force their students into liking or joining any type of activity? I personally think that it would be very ignorant to push their students into signing into an activity that he or she interested at all meaningthe student that doesn't enjoy any sort of activity. I think that if some students were to be forced to choose any sort of school activity meaning they'd have to choose one they'd enjoy it because of the varieties some schools have, but what is the other percentage of students that don't seem to be interested in any sort of activity that he or shes school provide and their principle is forcing them to they'd feel very overwhelmed so is it really worth it to force students into doing such things? not really its just makes life harder for the student in reality it's not smart to pressure students especially because they are developing into adults.

First, I personally think that its great that some schools have the opportunity to have extracurricular activities like sports, arts, engineering, and photography type of activities at school but to be completely honest some schools don't have many varieties and well for the school authority figure to make such rule that their students have to choose at least one activity at their school would be really unfair for both students and parents. why would it be unfair that the school is forcing students into forcing them into signing up for extracurricular activities? Because its not right to choose something for someone without he or shes consent in this type of situation. Schools have many choices but never enough because there are a lot of different students with different interest so if this decision were to be acknowledgedÂ the school environment wouldn't be healthy because it would show that the school doesn't care for students freedom of speech, and opinion on the decision. I think that the if the principle would ask for the students opinion on the extracurricular activities half of a percentage would agree and the other half of the percentage would disagree as I do as well. I think that because why not leave this as they were the students that enjoy the school activities do what they please and the the other half that don't enjoy any sort of activity just stay as they are and don't sign into any activity. Its easier like that both sides are satisfied and get their way.

Second, I that what if the schools only provided sports type of activities and for example students would feel a really overwhelmed, and stressed out if they'd have to pick any sort of sport;because some of as students aren't the sports type and to encourage someone to do something they don't enjoy would be really harsh. I know for sure that i'm not a sport type and I knowing that for sure I have to sign up for that certain activity i'd feel I have no solution because I know for sure i'm not a jock type. If my principle or for example another students principle were to order their students to sign into an activity at least one only containing any sort of sport I know for sure that the percentage of students who don't enjoy sports wouldn't sign but if otherwise being forced into students would have to sign to prevent consequences with their principles. The question is what if a student doesn't sign up to any extracurricular activity? do he or she get into any type of conflict is it smart that that the student gets in trouble for not wanting to participate in any type or sort of activity? the answer is no really the principle would look very ignorant in this sort of situation only because the student is choosing not contribute in any sort of activity during the year.

Third, I agree that in order to maintain a healthy school environment there should be a principle provided to provide authority, and organization to the school, but is it really worth it to make students choose something they don't enjoy? No because it would be so selfish to force students into an activity that they might not even like because they meaning the students are choosing the extracurricular activity just to get away from getting facing any conflict with the principle later on. To be brutally honest i think it would be wrong for a student to be pushed into something he or she might not like and would rather not participate instead because some students are simply not interested in any sort of activity that he or shes school might provide. Schools shouldn't do these sort of things it could put the student in a difficult situation and could effect grades because they are being pressured into choosing something they arent interested in it could be tough. And that is the third reason I would disagree with the decision that the principle must suggest students should take at least one extracurricular activity provided at their school.

In conclusion, no student should have to be forced into signing into clubs, or any type of activity provided only if the student gives their own consent that they are interested in any sort of school activity that their school provides. I apoligize to whom who has this type of school environment at their school it must be tough for some students that have this type of environment in which they are forced into activities that they might not enjoy it's not bad its selfish because what if principles were to be in the same position as the student they wouldn't agree much, I think that for all theses reasons I disagree with this decision its just not fair to the students they should be able to have their own perspective on things and should be able to have their own choices. And for all of these reasons I strongly disagree with the decision that principle getting all authority yes they help schools maintain but making choices for their students would be wrong and selfish.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
llama_70b_v1115,"Claim: The author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is worth the risks.

Introduction:

Studying Venus is a risky buisness. The planet's thick atmosphere and extreme temperatures make it one of the most hostile places in our solar system. But, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea.

Body:

Firstly, the author highlights the scientific benefits of studying Venus. He notes that Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor and that studying its atmosphere can provide valuable insights into climate change and the effects of greenhouse gases. Additionally, he points out that Venus's surface is covered in volcanoes and lava flows, which could provide information about the planet's geological history. By studying Venus, scientists can gain a better understanding of how Earth's atmosphere and geology have evolved over time.

Secondly, the author acknowledges the challenges of exploring Venus but argues that they are not insurmountable. He describes how NASA's Magellan spacecraft successfully mapped Venus's surface in the early 1990s, despite the planet's thick atmosphere. He also notes that the European Space Agency's Venus Express orbiter discovered new information about Venus's atmosphere in 2006. These examples demonstrate that it is possible to conduct meaningful research on Venus despite the dangers.

Lastly, the author emphasizes the potential benefits of exploring Venus for humanity's future in space. He notes that Venus is a prime target for future human missions, and that studying the planet could provide valuable insights into how to protect astronauts from hostile environments. He also suggests that exploring Venus could help us better understand the potential for life on other planets.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. By highlighting the scientific benefits, acknowledging the challenges, and emphasizing the potential benefits for humanity's future in space, the author presents a compelling argument for exploring Venus. While the risks are real, the potential rewards of studying Venus make it a worthwhile endeavour. Therefore, I agree with the author that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit.",1,llama_70b_v1,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

CC96CF4D3854,"There has been a lot of dispute about the electoral college, therefore causing much confusion. The president should be elected by popular vote only. This allows all voters to be treated equal, avoid untrsutworthhy electors and everyone will be given the same amount of knowledge about the campaigns.

The electoral college creates an unfair set up for the voters. The winner-takes all system gives all the electors to the presidential candidate who won. This system disregards that the opposing candidate received any votes, because all the electors are given to the winner. This doesn't give a chance to the candidates whose party is not necessarily popular in that state. Candidates, therefore spend more time and money campaigning in states they know their party is popular in. According to Bradfor Plumer in 2000, 25 of the largest media markets did not see a campaign ad, because they lived in one of the seventeen states that had no campaigning. Some candiates don't even campaign in some states based on this. According to an excerpt from

Mother Jones by Bradford Plumer most candidates focus on the ""swing"" states where it is close competiton.Â  In the case of tie in the electoral vote, the house of reprensentatives vote. This means oneÂ  vote represents the whole state. How is that fair for a state like Wyoming that has 500,000 voters?

Another popular dilema of the electoral college is untrustworthy electors. The electors are chosen in different ways. According to Bradford Palmer in 1960 there was a problemwith the Louisiana legistlature choosing bias electors. Segregationists wanted to be rid the democratic electors and replace them with electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. In another case, there has been a history of electors voting for whom they want instead of their party's vote.

Voters often are not update onall the campaigns due to the unfairness of the electoral vote. There's no doubt that the electoral college is a confusing subject, but this often creates confusion in the ballot box too. There has been times when voters have casted votes for the wrong candidate. The voters know about the presidential candidate not the elector. States often do not get the same level of campaigning as eachother. According to

Slate Magazine a larger state gets more attention from the presidential candidates than a smaller state does. Over 60 percent of citizens who vote would like a direct election instead of the kind we have now, says Bradford Palmer.

The electoral college has caused enough confusion in its lifetime. The United States should change to using only the popular vote to allow all the voters to be created equal, avoid untrustworthy electors, and everyone will be given the same amount of knowledge. This will prevent bias people and a more knowledgable campaign.       Â        Â     ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
4B045E8DF326,"Imagine you are a student, There is only two days until summer break and you cant wait to finally be free of all the boring school work. Then your teacher imforms you that you'll be having a summer project. Do you really want more work that will take up your free time? What if there was another way. Summer is the time for students to relax, unwind, and have a break from school. They should be able to design their own summer projects to make their time more enjoyable.

First, Summer is the students break time from everything school related. They finally have the chance to relax their bodies and brain from all the cludder from school. Students will more likely remember to do the project if they create them. Students would much rather spend their free time doing things they enjoy or want to do. because of all the fun they did during break and will be more happier and egur to tell someone or just want to share their summer experience.

Second, Teachers can't assign projects that each student would like. Everyone has their own way of things, some people dont like this or cant relate to some things people write or presented. If students don't like the project the teacher assigned they'll most like forget about it and wont finish it, meaning zero in the grade book. Teachers assign one project about a certain thing so it wont be that much work but at the same time a lot because of the many students.

Finally, students can get benefits from designing their own project. it teaches them differant skills like independents, responabiltlies, and self awarness. Provide insight of what the teachers be like and what they be having to do durning the weekends and breaks. Students will get to learn how the real world is and that you can't go out every single weekend cause you will work or other things important to care of before getting into the fun things.

Altogether, students designing their own projects can be very beneficial, and transform the student way of thinking about their work.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
B3F552D38E68,"The face on Mars is just another fake thing happening in this world. Honestly it is just another natural landform. Scientist might have been shocked when they saw it back in 1976 but know they are understanding and learning that the face is just a natural landform.

The face is just a natural landform because their has been 3 pictures to prove it, you cannot always see the face, and only few scientist even believe it is an alien artifact.

The first reason why the is just a natural landform is because their has been three pictures of the face. On the first picture it may have taken just to find the face but everybody was shocked about it.

Scientist and NASA could not believe it either but it took them another 22 years to get another picture of the face which the pictures were a lot clearer and you could almost tell that it looked a lot more like a natural landform.

This picture was helping scientist and NASA out to it would help them find out more about the face and help them discover what it actually was. Then they had another picture 3 years later in 2001 which blows it out that it is totally a natural landform. It is really easy to see when you look at the picture in 2001.

This is why the three pictures help identify the face is a natural landform.

The second reason why the face is a natural landform is because you cannot always see the face.

Sometimes when you look at pictures and you see the face you might be wondering what is that. Especially when you see the picture from 2001 that just looks like a pile of sand and part of Mars natural landform.

When you zoom out and see the picture from 1976 the one that is not a close up you can easily see it is a face but then when you zoom in you might be like what is that.

This is why when you see the face and you cannot always see the face it is a natural landform.

The last reason why the face is a natural landform is because only a few scientist believe it is an alien artifact.

This means most of the scientist believe it is a natural landform.

Also if you cannot see that it is a natural landform then you must be blind because it is kind of obvious.

Just because some scientist believe it is an alien artifact does not mean you should believe that too.

Also you can obvouisly see that it is not a alien artifact it is just a natural land form of Mars.

This face is just another natural landform that just makes Mars, well Mars.

If only a few scientist believe that the face is an alien artifact than that has to mean that the face is a natural landform.

In conclusion, the face is just another that is not made up but not really a human beings face or a alien face.

The face is just another natural landform of Mars that people get confused about. The 3 reasons why is because of pictures, you cannot always see it, and only few scientist believe it is an alien artifact. This is mainly why the Face is just another natural landform on the Red Planet, Mars. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
falcon_180b_v1_874,"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you about the school's cell phone policy. I believe that we should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

First of all, having a cell phone at school can be very helpful in case of an emergency. If a student needs to contact their parents or guardians, they can easily do so with their phone. This can also help parents feel more connected to their children and know that they are safe.

Secondly, cell phones can be a great tool for learning. With access to the internet, students can quickly look up information for class projects or assignments. There are also many educational apps that can help students with their studies.

Lastly, allowing students to have phones at school can help teach responsibility. Students will need to learn how to manage their time and not get distracted by their phones during class. This is an important skill that will benefit them in the future.

I understand that some people may be concerned about students using their phones during class time. However, I believe that with clear rules and consequences, this can be easily managed.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 is the better choice for our school's cell phone policy. It allows for the benefits of having a cell phone while also teaching responsibility and providing clear guidelines for appropriate use.

Thank you for considering my opinion.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. She is considering two possible policies:

llama_70b_v1844,"I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal to make extracurricular activities mandatory for all students. While I understand the importance of being involved in such activities, I believe that mandating them takes away the autonomy and freedom that students should have to choose how they spend their time outside of school.

Firstly, not all students have the same interests, abilities, or schedules. Some students may not enjoy participating in sports or other physical activities, while others may have commitments such as part-time jobs, family obligations, or personal interests that prevent them from participating in extracurricular activities. By forcing students to participate in activities that they may not enjoy or have time for, we are potentially setting them up for failure and taking away their motivation to pursue their passions.

Secondly, mandatory extracurricular activities can lead to students being overwhelmed and stressed. Many students already have a heavy academic workload, and adding an extracurricular activity on top of that can be too much to handle. This can result in poor performance in school and a negative impact on their mental health. It is important for students to have downtime and relaxation, and forcing them to participate in activities outside of school can take away that opportunity.

Thirdly, mandatory extracurricular activities can be costly for some families. Some activities require equipment, uniforms, or travel, which can be expensive. By making these activities mandatory, we may be creating a financial burden for families who cannot afford these expenses. This could lead to some students being excluded from participating, which goes against the principle of inclusivity that our school should strive for.

Finally, mandatory extracurricular activities can take away from the time students have to explore their own interests and passions. Students should have the freedom to explore their own hobbies and interests outside of school, without being forced to participate in activities that they may not enjoy. This freedom is important for students to develop their own identities and interests, and to discover what they are truly passionate about.

In conclusion, while I understand the benefits of extracurricular activities, I strongly disagree with the decision to make them mandatory for all students. Instead, we should encourage and support students in their interests and passions, and provide opportunities for them to participate in activities that they choose to pursue. This approach will result in students who are more motivated, less stressed, and more likely to succeed in their chosen paths.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

6F3C318ED62E,"Sir Winston Churchill, a celebrated statesman, once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This inspiring sentiment speaks to the power of perseverance, a sentiment the many successful people of today undoubtedly embody. 

Take for example, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Bezos famously took a huge risk in 1996 when he resigned from his highly successful job in finance, with no clear plan for what followed. Nonetheless, he made the leap of faith and invested everything he had into launching Amazon. And the rest is history: Amazon quickly rose to become one of the largest companies in the world.

Similarly, stories of personal failure and eventual success are ubiquitous. Whether it be a friend who failed out of school yet eventually graduated with honors, or a family member who failed to launch a business only to eventually achieve success with their second venture. The common denominator is often resilience.

If one aspires to success, then it is important to consider one's own relationship to failure. This essay seeks to explore why failure is necessary for eventual success.

Draft: 

Success is the goal of many, and yet is often a long and arduous journey. Sir Winston Churchill famously said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This quotation speaks to the power of courage and perseverance, values that are echoed in both famous and personal stories of success. Historical examples such as Winston Churchill and Jeff Bezos demonstrate how failure is often a catalyst for eventual success. Equally, within our own personal lives, we have stories of failure and eventual success. These stories often involve resilience over time. Therefore, this essay will explore why failure is necessary for eventual success. 

Historically, successful leaders such as Winston Churchill and Jeff Bezos serve as reminders that while failure can be disheartening, it is not the end of the road. Churchill was born into a politically influential family with a seemingly predestined career in politics, making his eventual failure less surprising. Churchill served in the military, where he was a failure, and suffered defeats in politics. But, despite the discouragement, Churchill applied his courage and press",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

22f65ab6,"Cars are a very, very common mode of transportation used all over the world. People depend on cars to get them from place to place every single day. While driving cars seem to be the quickest and easiest form of transportation, there are negative sides to it. These negative effects can be harmful to the environment and humans if we aren't careful. Therefore, citizens should take a step forwards limiting their car usage. The advantages of limiting car usage is that it reduces smog, saves resources, and is a healthier lifestyle.

When cars are used, they can pollute the air with harmful chemicals and toxins. Air pollution is a serious issue that is occurring around the globe. This is important because cars are polluting the air we need in order to survive. Some cities around the world have gotten so polluted that they had to restrict people from using cars over a period of time to try and cleanse the air. If you drove during the ban, then you would receive a fine. Paris and bogota are two cities that participated in the ban. After the pollution cleared up some, the ban was lifted in both cities. Therefore, reducing the air pollution is a major advantage to not using your car as much.

Over time, cars can use up a lot of resources. Cars run on gasoline, which is a fossil fuel. There is only so much of it and once it's gone, it's gone. Our fossil fuels are being used up quick, so it's time to start saving them. You can save resources by driving around less. Instead of driving yourself, you could either walk, ride a bicycle, skate, ride a bus, or carpool with some friends. These are all ways you could help save the planet's resources.

Lastly, limiting how much you drive your car can be beneficial because it is a healthier lifestyle for you. You could get more excerise and help the environment at the same time. One community in Germany, named Vauban, gave up their cars completely. They are in a movement called ""smart planning."" This community gets around by walking or riding bicycles. Their lifestyle includes having stores and markets a walk away so they have easier access to them. Having a healthier lifestyle is an advantage because it's important to take care of yourself.

The advantages of limiting car usage is that it reduces smog, saves resources, and is a healthier lifestyle. Driving less reduces smog because it helps clean the air from toxins. It also helps save the limited amount of fossil fuels that we have. Not to mention, driving your car less will give you a chance to live a healthier lifestyle because you will get much more excercise. Overall, driving less is beneficial to both humans and the environment. Therefore, join the movement and limit your car usage.",0,train_essays,,5
0BCBCD2D4FEA,"To test students on their knowledge, teachers have begun to assign projects rather than traditional tests. There has been a debate on if these projects should be designed by teachers or by students. I believe these summer projects need to be teacher- designed. The teachers have much more experience at designing projects, the students may assign themselves an easier project, and the teachers get payed tax revenue for the sole purpose of teaching children and designing projects.

The first major reason these projects should be teacher- designed is that teachers have experience in creating projects. Most teachers have gone through many years of education to get where they are today. They have gained skills and insight that most students do not have. Because teachers have this experience and knowledge, they know how they can force their students to display what they know. A project is meant to be a creative display of the collective information students have learned. Because students have not been prepared in education, they do not have the skills to properly design a project for other students. Some people may argue that when teachers let students design their own projects, they are teaching them important skills such as problem solving. Although their problem solving skills may be tested, they are still more likely to design a less efficient project due to their lack of education preparation.

Where as a student lacks this education preparation, a teacher has spent years gathering it. Teachers can use their knowledge to create the perfect project for the class.

Another reason projects should be designed by teachers is that the students may try to design an easier project so they can complete it quicker. As a student myself, I know that many students will try to get out of work if they can. Every school has issues with students not completing their assignments. When given the power to chose their work load, students most often pick an easier assignment. When most teachers assign a project, they do not want it to be a quick and easy task for the students. A project is meant to challenge the student. Students typically try to avoid such challenges. Students, like all humans on earth, are flawed. From my own high school experience, I know that I would design my project to give me the best chance of receiving an excellent grade. If students are forced to design projects, projects will become less efficient in displaying what a student understands. Teachers are more willing to challenge the students and help them grow.

The final reason that teachers should design projects is that they are payed to do so. A significant portion of American tax revenue is used to pay teachers who work across the country. When teachers force students to design projects, the teacher is pawning off his or her own work to the students. Many tax- paying citizens would be incredibly upset to see their taxes go to waste. If teachers are allowed to pawn off their work and still get payed, it sets a very poor example for the young, impressionable students. It teaches the students that you can make others do your work just so you can receive the credit. It would be unethical for any teacher to force their own student into fulfilling the job and tasks of a teacher.

In conclusion, all school projects should be designed by the teacher because it would be morally irresponsible if they did not. Projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have more education preparation than students, the students tend to avoid hard work, and teachers are payed to design projects and classwork. If we allow students to design projects, the American education system would be doing a great disservice to the young students of today, and the the leaders of tomorrow.Â    Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

Engaging in active vs. inactive activities has been a topic of debate for years. While it is widely accepted that active activities are better for our physical and mental health, there are also benefits to engaging in inactive activities. In this essay, I will explore the benefits, drawbacks, and implications of engaging in active vs. inactive activities.

Firstly, active activities such as exercise, sports, and outdoor activities have numerous benefits. They improve our physical health by reducing the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health issues. Additionally, active activities have been shown to improve our mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, engaging in active activities can also help us develop important life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving.

However, it is important to note that inactive activities can also serve a purpose. For example, engaging in activities such as reading, listening to music, or watching movies can help us relax and recharge. Additionally, inactive activities can also provide a sense of accomplishment, such as completing a project or achieving a goal.

To achieve accomplishments, it is important to set clear and achievable goals. This can be done by breaking down larger goals into smaller, more manageable ones. It is also important to have a clear plan and to stay motivated. By setting goals and working towards them, we can achieve a sense of accomplishment and personal growth.

Taking risks and facing fears are also important for progress and learning. By stepping out of our comfort zones and trying new things, we can learn new skills and gain valuable experiences. Additionally, facing fears can help us build confidence and resilience.

However, taking risks can also have negative consequences. For example, if we take too many risks without proper preparation or understanding, we may end up in dangerous situations. It is important to weigh the potential risks and benefits before",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,8

When you approach challenges with a positive mindset, you are more likely to overcome obstacles and achieve your goals. Additionally, a positive attitude can help you build strong relationships with others, as people are more likely to be drawn to individuals who are optimistic and enthusiastic.

One of the most significant benefits of having a positive attitude is that it can help you navigate difficult situations. When you face challenges, it's easy to become discouraged and give up. However, by maintaining a positive attitude, you can stay motivated and focused on finding solutions to the problems you face. This can lead to better outcomes and a more fulfilling life.

Another advantage of having a positive attitude is that it can help you build strong relationships with others. People are more likely to be drawn to individuals who are optimistic and enthusiastic, as these qualities can be contagious. By maintaining a positive attitude, you can build stronger connections with your friends, family, and colleagues, which can lead to more meaningful and fulfilling relationships.

In addition to these benefits, having a positive attitude can also help you achieve your goals and dreams. When you are honest and prepared, you are more likely to be successful in your endeavors. By maintaining a positive attitude and working hard, you can achieve the success you desire and create a better life for yourself and your loved ones.

Overall, I believe that having a positive attitude is essential for achieving success and happiness in life.

8ADAADB6FDFE,"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College has been around since America was born. The founding fathers established it in the Consititution. Yes, there are some problems and concern with the Electoal College, but aren't there problems with everything in the world today? The pronalems can be fixed with some time and effort, and in my opiniion the Electoral College is more beneficial to the election process than harmful.

The Electoral College was created as a compromise and was agreed on by many. Some things people don't like about the Electoral College is that it's like a ""winner-take-all"" system, becuse then canidates don't spend time in states they know they're not going to win. But, with the winner-take-all system we will have a certain outcome with no disputes. This gives the canidate a landslide electoral-vote victory in a state. Also, the artice,""

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""

says, ""There is no pressue for a run-off election when no canidate wins a majority of the votes casts; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential elecrion process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winer.""

Another concern with the Electoral College that people have is that voters aren't voting for the president, they're voting for the slate of electors, who elect the presodent. But, each party selects a slate of electors who votes for the party's nominee. We the people get to choose our slate of electors, so you get to choose who gets to vote for the president of your choice, which is fair. And, just because the canidate you didn't vote for wins the electoral vote, that doesn't mean they will win the national popular vote. For example, in 2000, Gore haad more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes and we all know Bush still won.

The Electoral College also give ""swing"" states to play A HUGE role in the voting process. Most canidates focus their campaign efforts of the toss-up states, because the winner-take-all system. The swing states decide who the next president will be. They already know the states that they will get votes from, but the swing states are never consitant and always win someone the election. Also, states with a bigger population have more electoral votes, and by this the Electoal College restores some weight in the political balance by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate ddecreed in the Constitution.

All-in-all, The Electoral College has more positives than negatives in these situations. It helps us have a certain winner, avoid runn-off elections, choose who we want to win the election, and gives states power. The Electoal College was put in the Constitution, and so poeple like Thomas Jefferson thoughht it was important that we have an election system like the Electoral College. In my opinion, whe you weigh out allthe pros and cons about the Electoral College the pros weight out all the cons. And, if there was a different system there would always be problems with that. People always try to find problems with everything, and you can never pleas everyone these days.

My evidence that the face is not really a human being is first of all it doesnt even have a body. Since they took pictures of the face, they could have croped the pictures to look real. In the pictures that scientists took of the face in 1976 to 2001 the pictures look nothing like a face. The pictures show cracks that may appear to look like a face but really isnt.

When a scientist was taking a picture on mars he noticed an enormous head nearly two miles from one end to the other end and it seemed that it was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called cyndonia. The cause of that could have been a shadow and not a human looking back at him. Another thing is that i dont think they seen a Martian because when they said that they had pictures of a Martian, picture cant always be true because of how people crop pictures today.

CAAB28864F44," In the new year, there are countless enjoyable and educational activities available. These activities can be fun because they provide an opportunity to do something different and engage in new experiences. It is important to participate in these activities because they can help you learn and grow.

One activity that can be both enjoyable and educational is playing a sport. There are many different sports to choose from, and they can be both aggressive and exciting to play. Playing a sport can also provide an opportunity to travel and compete against other teams or players. Additionally, playing a sport can help you develop important skills such as teamwork, communication, and discipline.

I personally played soccer for a few years and found it to be a very enjoyable and educational experience. When I first started playing, I was not very good at it and often felt discouraged. However, I decided to participate in a summer soccer program and went to a soccer field every evening. I quickly improved my skills and became more confident in my abilities. It was also a lot of fun to play with other players and compete against other teams.

Another activity that can be both enjoyable and educational is playing a musical instrument. Playing an instrument can be a lot of fun because it allows you to create music and express yourself creatively. Additionally, playing an instrument can provide an opportunity to travel and perform with a group of friends. I personally played the guitar for a few years and found it to be a very enjoyable and educational experience.

Chemistry is another activity that can be both enjoyable and educational. Chemistry can be a lot of fun because it allows you to mix different chemicals and create new compounds. Additionally, chemistry can be a great way to learn about the world around you and how things work. I am looking forward to participating in a chemistry class this year and learning more about the subject.

Overall, there are many different activities available that can be both enjoyable and educational. It is important to choose an activity that fits your interests and goals, and to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to learn. By participating in these activities, you can improve your skills, gain new experiences, and have fun at the same time.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

llama_70b_v1372,"I think that students should have the right to grade their teachers. It's important for teachers to know how they're doing and what they can do to improve. It's also important for students to have a say in their education and feel like their voices are being heard.

One reason why students should be able to grade their teachers is that it would help teachers to improve. If a teacher is doing something that's not helping their students learn, they should know about it so they can change it. For example, if a teacher is always talking too fast and their students can't understand them, the students should be able to tell them that so they can slow down. This would help the teacher to become a better teacher and the students to learn more.

Another reason is that it would make students feel more invested in their education. If students feel like they have a say in their education, they'll be more likely to care about it and try harder. For example, if a student knows that their teacher is willing to listen to their feedback and make changes based on it, they'll be more likely to pay attention in class and participate.

It's also important to note that students are the ones who spend the most time with their teachers, so they're in the best position to judge how well their teachers are doing. They see their teachers every day, so they're able to see how their teachers interact with them and how they teach. This means that their feedback would be valuable and accurate.

However, there are also some reasons why students should not be able to grade their teachers. One reason is that students might not be mature enough to give fair feedback. They might grade their teachers based on things that don't really matter, like how nice they are or how fun their classes are, instead of how well they're teaching. This wouldn't be fair to the teachers and wouldn't help them to improve.

Another reason is that students might have biases that would affect their feedback. For example, a student might grade their teacher poorly just because they don't like them, even if they're a good teacher. This wouldn't be fair to the teacher and wouldn't give an accurate picture of how well they're doing.

In conclusion, I believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers. It would help teachers to improve, make students feel more invested in their education, and give valuable feedback. However, it's also important to make sure that the feedback is fair and accurate, and that students are mature enough to give good feedback.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Some people believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers.

95570A90AED0,"Do you ever wish you could just look at someone and be able to tell how they are feeling? At the Beckman Istitute for advanced Science at the University of Illinois, Prof. Thomas Huang and his colleague are created just that. they call it ""Facial Action Coding System"". This system could be put into computers to keep track of your emotions. Maybe even by tracking your emotions, you could be happier.

The process works by using a 3-D computer of your face; all 44 major muscles. Than is the Facial Action Coding System associates the six basic emotionsÂ happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddnessÂwith each movement of the facial muscles.

Most human communication is nonverbal, even through we may not relize it, we always show our emotions. The facial expression for each emotion are unviersal. Using the Facial Action Coding System, it can track humans emotion or even a painting such as the Mona Lisa.

As humans we are always feeling something, weather its anger, saddness, or happiness. I think it would be of great value to have this technology at school, and put into our computers. Not all kids can learn the same way, which means kids can not be teached in the same way. If the student is working on the computer and they do not understand the lesson. The computer could change the lesson to teach it a differnt way.

All in all, I think this kind of technology could be very useful, not only in school but for psychologist and other who study the human body. Our emotions say alot about us amd if that is how most of us communicate; we should know more about them.

26E1527FE040,"Cars have been around for over hundred years. They caused some good and bad things. People use cars daily to go places. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.

To begin with there will be less car emissions. Ever since the first car rolled off the assembly line they have been polluting the air. As seen here ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter"" (Duffer). From all the cars and trucks that Paris has, they have the most emissions in their air. Another example will be ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France"" (Duffer). From experance working on cars the diesel engine give off the most pollution out of all the vehicles on the roads today. Since the air in France was getting to bad they had to ""Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at hme or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)"" (Duffer). The smog got so bad in the air that France had to take a good amount of drivers off the roads to reduce their emissions so the smog will be reduced. As a result from parking those drivers ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined"" (Duffer). Today, cars are assories and people need their cars to go to work and cannot blame those people for doing what they had to do. One last example is ""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" (Rosenthal). Since people are using cars less the pollution in the air will decrease. The emissions had gotten to bad and its hurting our Earth.

Lastly is there will be less traffic on the streets. Lately people have not been getting their drivers license.""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (Rosenthal). The newer generation does not have the disire to drive and to work on cars like the generation before them. Another example is ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent were sold"" (Rosenthal). 70 percent is a high number of people and that is a lot of people that are not on the roads. Since those people are in Germany this is what happen in France ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (Duffer). That is a huge decrease in traffic there will be no problems getting anywhere on time. Another key example is ""People park their cars in large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"" (Rosenthal). Since people do not have the money to pay for a parking spot they have to get rid of their cars and that will definatly clear up the roads. One last example is ""Vauban's streets are completey 'car-free'- except the main drag to down town"" (Rosenthal). Vauban's street are compleatly empty now hows that for no traffic.

In closing, cars have been around for a while now. They caused some problems and no problems. People use cars to go places daily. Now days people have not been using their cars that much. Some advantages, from some texts, of limiting car usage is there will be less car emissions, and less traffic.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
falcon_180b_v1_403,"I think that we should raise the minimum wage in our country because it would help people who are struggling to make ends meet. Many people who earn minimum wage have families to support, and it is hard to pay for rent, food, and other expenses when you are earning very little money.

One reason to raise the minimum wage is that it would help reduce poverty. When people earn more money, they can afford to live in better conditions and provide for their families. For example, they could afford to buy fresh fruits and vegetables instead of just relying on cheap, unhealthy foods. This would improve their health and well-being.

Another reason to raise the minimum wage is that it could boost the economy. When people have more money to spend, they tend to spend it. This would help businesses by increasing their sales, and they could hire more employees to keep up with the demand. More jobs would be created as a result.

However, some people argue against raising the minimum wage. They say that it would lead to higher costs for businesses, which could force them to increase their prices or even lay off workers. But I think that the benefits of raising the minimum wage outweigh these potential drawbacks.

In conclusion, raising the minimum wage would be a good thing for our country. It would help lift people out of poverty, improve their lives, and boost the economy. It is time for our government to take action and make this happen.

03B3EDA0F9D7,"Some student have to do projects for school over the summer; but because its summer they do not want to do anything for school. Many people debate on whether these projects should be designed by teachers or students. It's a parent dream for their kids to still learn over the summer, so some send them to learning activities or ask teachers for school work for their children to do while on vacation. But do these kids really learn anything by these projects or school work if their not enjoying it? These summer projects should be designed by the students because not only will they be learning but they will also be enjoying doing these projects, students can also use their creativity to design these projects, and also because these student will be doing these projects over their summer vacation they should at least be able to design their own project.

If a student isn't enjoying how they are learning it's most likely that he or she will not pay attention and actually not learn anything. It's the same case with these summer projects, if students are able to design their own projects maybe they'll learn more than they usually do and enjoy doing their project. For example, teachers sometimes do projects in their class that they design, they choose groups,and they choose the topic for the group. The students of course their going to do the project but they wouldn't learn anything about it because their going to do it just to get the good grade. However, if the student design their own summer projects their grade will most likely increase because they didn't only do the project to get a good grade they would do it because they would enjoy doing the projects they designed.

People always say they want this generation to use their creativity more, especially in school teachers always tell their students, ""Use your creativity!"", but by teachers designing the summer projects, they limit the creativity many students have. How can students use their creativity if teachers will not even let students create their own summer projects? Designing their own summer projects will let students use, show, and express their creativity and who knows their projects can get positive feedback from other students. Students using their creativity in designing these summer can influence other classes in doing the same. This could help many students in using their creativity not only in projects like these but also in all their school work.

If students have to take time out of their summer vacation to do these projects they should at least be the one designing their own projects. Many students do not like doing anything school related over the summer; therefore knowing that they have to do a project over the summer it is most likely that lots of students wouldn't do the project. Especially because teachers do the same type of projects most of the time. But knowing that they can design their own projects and use their creativity its likely they'll do it. Summer vacation is the one vacation every student loves they should at least be able to enjoy designing their project as well.

Doing a summer project wouldn't be fun if it's the same project we get while we're in school; but by letting students design their summer project maybe, just maybe they could enjoy it. It would require them to use their creativity which lots of students like doing, show their creativity. Summer vaction is the longest break we have before going back to school, students should at least be allowed to design a project they want to do. Students like doing new things and constantly doing the same thing all the time. ToÂ conclude, students hate doing school work over the summer because all they want to do is enjoy their vacation and relax; but designing their own summer project could be fun for them.

An experimental car free community in Germany called ""Vauban"" completed in 2006 is a town where 70% of its residents do not own cars and the streets are completely car free. It's constructed so everything is within walking distance. This means no need for cars, wich means little to no polution. People usaully bike or walk to their destination in Vauban.""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much better this way"" says a Vauban resident. Vauban is a component of a movment called smart planning. As you can see, a community with no cars is prospering aurgurably better than one with cars. People are less stressed and pollution is heavily reduced. A life/community with no cars has little to no negative results.

""After a near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air oof the global city."" france need a solution to reduce the smog, so they banned even-numberd license plates on monday and odd on tuesday. with some exceptions such as electric cars and hybrids. After five days of heavy smog and no cars, smog congestion was reduced to 60 percent. Here is another perfect example how decreasing cars on the street is directly linked to pollution decrease .because they took away cars, pollution was heavily decreased. This is a huge advantage thatÂ  limiting car usage has.

The USA has always been a car culture, but things are changing for the better.

car liscense ownership rates have only decreased since 2005. this means we are putting out less emissions than 12 years ago! we are eqaul to where the country was in 1995. the reasons vary as to why lisence ownsership is decreasing but so far it has its advantages. People are car pooling more and using bikes and walking to their destination. the only negative side of limited car usauge is for the car industry. with less cars on the road, they get less money. But overall people will benifit from this.

258F5D734299,"Why do people ask for advise from more then one person?

When people are seeking advise, they will sometimes ask more than one person. Why do people do this? Usually, that person wants more than one perspective, they may want to understand different opinions. Think of it as a serve, your eating at a restaurant and the waitress gives you a slip of paper asking ""

how'd we do?""

The restaurant wants to understand what they can do to make dinning there better.

There are many other ways that explain why people ask for advise from more than one person. In order to find the best reason to understand why people ask more than one person for advise maybe to do it your self. Some examples maybe to ask some friends, ""

whats' your favorite color ""

or

"" what did you think about the big game last night.""

Simple questions can have simple answers, but have a great impacted on what your looking for. Eventually, you find what your looking for and you would know what your favorite colors and things to eat are.

Asking multiple people the same question could provide many outcomes too. For example, say you were thinking about getting the newest game console, but you also want to get the latest phone, and you have enough money only to get one. You could ask people what they think that you should get first if cannot make a decision. If I were debating on getting a new console, or the latest phone I would use tally marks to keep tract of all the votes. That way you won't forget about all the vote of the people you asked. You got the new console, and the next thing you know you here about the latest phone catching on fire. Talk about a good outcome!

If still don't get why a person may ask different people the same question then just think of it like voting. You maybe thinking voting is a totally different organization, not quite. In theory, voting has a lot to do with the prompt: why do people ask for advise from more then one person. Its literally in the name, voting is like asking people what'd they think, and the outcome is who or what wins the vote. As you can see the previous votes have not had a such good outcome. ""Donald Trump.""

In conclusion, when people ask for advise, yes, they will sometimes talk to more than one person, because maybe the best advise isn't the first thing you hear. Thats why people do it.

C652190DB53F," Working alone or in a group can have its advantages and disadvantages. While working alone can be beneficial for individuals who prefer to work in a quiet and peaceful environment, working in a group can provide opportunities for collaboration and the exchange of ideas. However, working alone has more benefits than working in a group.

One of the main advantages of working alone is that it allows individuals to work at their own pace and in their own style. When working alone, individuals are not interrupted by others and can focus on their work without distractions. This can lead to increased productivity and a more relaxed work environment. Additionally, working alone can be beneficial for individuals who are shy or introverted, as they can work in a more private and comfortable setting.

On the other hand, working in a group can be beneficial for individuals who enjoy collaborating with others and sharing ideas. When working in a group, individuals can bounce ideas off each other and gain new perspectives on a project. Additionally, working in a group can be beneficial for individuals who enjoy socializing and interacting with others.

However, working in a group can also be stressful and distracting. When working in a group, individuals may be interrupted by others and may feel pressure to conform to the opinions and ideas of the group. This can lead to increased stress and a less relaxed work environment. Additionally, working in a group can be overwhelming for individuals who are not comfortable with socializing or who have different working styles than the group.

In conclusion, working alone has more benefits than working in a group.

81958a1a,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Over the years, there has been a growing trend in various parts of the world to limit car usage in order to promote smarter planning, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more sustainable communities. This shift in thinking has led to the development of car-free neighborhoods, driving bans due to pollution, and initiatives like car-free days. By limiting car usage, we can experience several benefits that positively impact our environment and overall quality of life.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It is widely known that passenger cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, for example, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions. By reducing our dependency on cars, we can significantly decrease these emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change. This is especially crucial in car-intensive areas in the United States, where cars account for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage has several positive effects on public health. Car-free neighborhoods and initiatives like car-free days create an environment that promotes walking, biking, and the use of public transportation. This active lifestyle helps to combat sedentary behavior and its associated health problems, such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. By encouraging more physical activity, we can improve the overall health and well-being of our communities.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. Suburbs that are designed with smart planning principles, like Vauban in Germany, have seen a significant decrease in traffic. Without cars on the streets, these neighborhoods become more accessible for pedestrians and cyclists. As a result, there is less congestion and more freedom of movement. This not only saves time for residents but also contributes to a safer and more enjoyable neighborhood environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and compact communities. By placing stores within walking distance and implementing better public transportation systems, we can reduce the need for long-distance car travel. This new approach to community development allows for more efficient land use and reduces the reliance on cars as the primary mode of transportation. As a result, we can create more livable neighborhoods that prioritize human connection and sustainability.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By doing so, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, decrease traffic congestion, and create more sustainable communities. With the growing recognition of the negative impacts of car culture, it is important to embrace alternatives and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars. In doing this, we can create a healthier, greener, and more enjoyable environment for all.",1,radek_500,,0
12BA7182FFC7,"The opportunity of being able to learn and go to school from home is a great offer for people who have a busy life and know they do not have time to travel to school and do there daily activities. Students will benefit from this due to the fact of being able to choose when you are going to start your class and know they can do it without any clamor or distractions. For people who choose a video conference as opposed to the online classes, it will be more challenging to maybe the schedule they have to adhere to to make the class. Overall learning from home is a great chance and should be taken advantage of when you have a busy life and do not have time to go to school to take one or two classes in that moment and have to travel a good distance to make it on time. Studying from home and learning from home is the best thing only for the simple fact of being in the comfort of your own home and being able to take it to your own pace and not get lost so easily is a crucial part for when students are trying to learn. For example, in classrooms there are students who do not let the teacher do her job and make a ruckus in the room to the point where the teacher has to stop the learning process and take care of the situation. Then you are left aside wondering how to do a certain problem or not understanding well and need help. It is not easy to be in a noisy disruptive classroom while you are trying to learn and others block that from you as opposed to being able to be home in your room or in your dinning room and take all the information needed in and learn the proper way. There are many advantages as to why learning from home is a better opportunity and why it will have a better effect on people trying to learn a certain subject and being able to learn it to the point of being able to teach it.

Another example of how learning from home is a step up from going to school is if you are a single mother and you work two obs but are trying to progress in life, move on, be a role model, and give a life to your child. When you are a single mother and you have to take care of another life that is not just your own, its hard to find a moment to relax and try to relieve yourself for a moment and do something that interests you. Online courses help these types of people that dont really know whats going to happen in their day and may not know if they will be able to attend class if they go to an actual school for these classes but with these classes they can start or stop whenever they have the time to learn and relax at home with a cup of tea, a note book, and a pencil.

falcon_180b_v1_764,"I disagree with the decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities can be beneficial for students, it should not be mandatory for everyone. 

Firstly, some students may have other commitments outside of school that prevent them from participating in extracurricular activities. For example, a student may have to work part-time to support their family or care for younger siblings. Mandating participation in extracurricular activities would unfairly burden these students and potentially harm their academic performance.

Secondly, forcing students to participate in activities they are not interested in may lead to a negative experience for both the student and the activity itself. If a student is forced to join a sports team but does not enjoy playing sports, they may not put in the effort required to succeed and bring down the team's performance. This could lead to resentment from other team members and coaches.

Finally, extracurricular activities should be a choice, not an obligation. Students should have the freedom to choose how they spend their time outside of school hours. By mandating participation, we are taking away that choice and potentially limiting students' ability to explore their own interests and hobbies.

In conclusion, while extracurricular activities can be beneficial, they should not be mandatory for all students.

darragh_claude_v7_629,"I disagree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities have benefits, mandating participation interferes with student choice and personal circumstances.

Not all students have the time or ability to participate in extracurriculars. Some students have jobs or family responsibilities outside of school that prevent taking on additional commitments. Others may need time for rest, studying or other personal obligations. Forcing involvement denies consideration of individual needs and situations.

Extracurricular activities are most beneficial when joined through genuine personal interest rather than obligation. When compelled to participate, students may resent it and not get as much value from the experience. A variety of interests and talents exist among the student body. Not every activity will appeal to all people. Forced participation threatens to undermine the enjoyment and enrichment extracurriculars can provide. 

Rather than mandating involvement, the principal would be better served strongly encouraging participation and helping students discover opportunities that align with their passions. Information sessions, try-outs of different activities and flexibility in commitment levels could help boost involvement from those who want to take part, without overburdening those who cannot or do not wish to do so. Overall student well-being, not just resume padding, must be the priority.

While extracurriculars offer valuable skills and experiences, not all students are in a position to benefit right now. Individual circumstances deserve consideration over blanket rules.

I believe student's would benefit from attending online classes from home. From my position I believe this would help student's who speak different langauges, help students with learning disabilities, and give the student a better learning enviroment. Alot of school's don't offer the capibility of online courses, online courses should be discussed more and provided for the student's who need it. Also being at home might make the individual feel more comfortable. Learning from home with online courses would be a great idea.

Student's who speak different langauges or that are from a different country might have a hard time adjusting to their new school. This is an example where being at home while taking online course's would help. This would help because the online course could provide the langauge the student need's so they could understand. Also the school would save some time and hassle with trying to find an individual teacher that could help this student every second of the day. This is a great example for the student to take online course's at home so the individual would be able to understand better and have a good atmosphere to learn in.

Some people have learning disabilities, they might not learn like everyone else dose. Not everyone learns the same including myself, I find it easier to visually learn. Some students might find it hard to learn in school and they feel more comfortable at home learning on a online class. It's the little things like this you can change to make a big difference to help someone out. The key to learning is to find somthing that makes sense to you, online classes from home could help people learn better and understand more that have learning disabilities.

Being at home is an awsome learning enviroment because your comfortable and you can stay focused. School's have alot of distractions with people talking and being loud. Having loud distractions makes learning hard for myself and other people. A better learning enviroment like being at home makes it easier to concentrate better and helps you to be able to get your work done in a timely manner. Cutting out distractions and being focused more with a better enviroment is a great idea to keep you on task from learning from home.

43dc6d4aeeae_04112023,"The Future of Autonomous Transportation 

As the article discusses, driverless cars present both opportunities and challenges that deserve thoughtful consideration. On one hand, they could significantly reduce accidents and traffic fatalities by removing human error from the driving process. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, over 90% of crashes are due to human error, so replacing human drivers with computers programmed to drive safely could prevent thousands of unnecessary deaths each year. Additionally, driverless cars could provide improved mobility for the elderly and disabled, many of whom are unable to drive themselves. By giving more people transportation independence, autonomous vehicles could help address issues of accessibility and social equity. 

However, the rapid development of this new technology also introduces risks that must be addressed. As the article notes, fully autonomous vehicles have not been tested in all typical driving scenarios, so there is still potential for software or sensor failures that could lead to accidents. Additionally, committing to widespread use of driverless cars would require substantial infrastructure upgrades and changes to traffic laws. The costs and challenges of overhauling regulations and road systems could slow the pace of implementation. There are also valid privacy concerns about how vehicle software would collect and store data about passengers' travel patterns and locations.  

Overall, while autonomous vehicles represent an innovative shift that could have meaningful safety and mobility benefits, more testing and regulation is still needed to ensure they can be deployed responsibly. A gradual, carefully-planned transition that prioritizes addressing technical and policy issues over rapid adoption seems the safest approach. Rather than an outright rejection or endorsement of driverless cars, policymakers and the public should have an ongoing dialogue to discuss both the promises and risks of this emerging technology as it continues to develop. With open discussion and preventative regulation, many of the challenges could be overcome to allow autonomous transportation to ultimately improve lives while avoiding unintended consequences.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,9

I think that it is not right to require a B grade average to participate in sports.

Not all of the kids are capable of getting a B grade average. Most of the reasons why is mainly because of people struggling in their classes. If this were to go into affect, less people would try out for these sports teams. The only positive thing i see in this idea is that it will make students try harder to get better grades in their classes to have activity status to participate in these activities.

Lots of people struggle to get a B or even a C average. In my opinion, I don't think grades should be a requirement to do extra activities. Personally i can get a B average but making that extra pus for it can be quite stressful at times. As i said previously, this is mostly a negative thing to do for the most part.

It will be impossible to live a happy life with a negative attitude, but if you have a positive attitude, everything is going to feel better. Having a positive attitude will help you succeed, have a good life, and higher emotions.

To succeed in life, you will need to have a positive attitude. If you have a positive attitude, you will succeed in life. Imagine having a job that you do not like, and you are thinking of looking for a better job, but you are not sure or you are having a negative attitude, those two things are going to keep you back from getting a better job. If you make goals in your life, and you want to accomplish all your goals, you will need to start by having a positive attitude. For example, you see a car that you really like, and you say to yourself, ""I want this car, or my goal is to one day be able to buy this car."" You will start by putting more effort in your job to earn more money to get the car, and in all the process to get more money, you will need to be positive or you will not get there. If you want to have a better position in your job or in anything that you are doing right now, you need to have that positive attitude to get where you want to be.

Having a positive attitude is going to make you have a good life. If you have a good life, you are going to have less stress and you are going to be healthy. Most of the time, we do things to be happy and feel good, but if you are doing all those things with a bad attitude, it will be difficult to feel the happiness. Having happiness in your life is very important because if you are not happy, you are going to be depressed, and going through depression is a very difficult thing. Keep in mind that if you start having a positive attitude, you will get through anything.

Finally, higher emotions are going to help you stay strong and have a positive attitude. Positive attitude reflects in everything. If you have high emotions, a lot of people are going to want to be around you, mostly the people that have negative attitudes or very low emotions because all",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

This option can benefit many students that cannot attend schools in the regular schedule. Many students don not have the resources, time or for others personal reasons to attend schools and this option can be helpful for them to finished the studies.

Online classes. This is one of the option for those students that want finished the schools. This option can help them. They can take the classes from theirs home without go to the school and according the time that they have. Time can be a really impediment to attend school, a lot students that leave schools is because they have to work after school and they do not have enough time to do homework or other school activities. They start falling their classes and at the end they diced to leave the school and go to work. Because they may have to feed their families. Family and money can be other reason why the guys leave school some of then came here and don not have any family. so they have to studied and work at the same time to get some money to sent back to their families. But now with this option they can continue with their studies.

The other option can be the video conferences. This option also is a good idea to keep studying. Like online classes this also you can take it from your home any time that you want or depend the schedule that the teacher give you. Because on this option you are going to be taken classes in real time with teachers, that you will see each other by camera. This option can be helpful because while you are taking the class, you can talk to the teacher and ask about something that may be confuse you, and keep practice with him like you was in a school classroom.

One thing that make this great is that wile you are studying you can keep work and doing personal activities that you usually do. and the good of this program is that not only work for young people, adult also can attend this courses and finished their high school. Because other reason why people leave school is because they are over age or too old to go high school. But with this option you do not have that problem because this involve all people.

As we know in this time more and more teenagers are leaving the school. Some of then because do not have other option and others just because they are lazy. But now that the schools are providing this option many student that left school and other people can be benefit with that, and be a easy way for a lot students to finished their studies at get a better future.

Good morning! It has come to my attention that you are considering to change our school policy. If you haven't noticed, most of the students have a C average. Many students may be arguing that changing our policy is wrong; my argument is just the opposite. By the end of this letter, I'm sure that you'll be convinced that we should definitely change our policy.

Which is more important, grades or after school activities? Yes, students do like to play sports and do other activities, but does this mean they should let their grades go? I believe this is very wrong. But, this doesn't mean we should let the students stop what they love to do. Getting good grades is very important, and I believe parents would agree with me as well. I myself, am one of these people that like to get good grades. This is what being in school is about.

First of all, grades on a report card reflect what the student knows, and what they need more help on. I think that it's fair that students should at least get a B in school. If students want to play sports or do other activities, then they should learn to be good physically, as well as mentally. In America, it's all about equality and fairness. Your idea of changing the policy seems fair enough. I'm sure that when you change your policy, you'll see a great change on your students report cards.

When I was in Kindergarten, my parents would tell me school is fun. Now that I'm in 8th grade, you see that it gets a little more hard and boring. But, students can be more enthusiastic about school, when they feel how getting good grades feels great. I assure you, once students realize that they have to get their grades higher, to play sports or do other activities, they will learn that they can be both smart, and active.

Lastly, I hope that you'll consider the change in policy, because it will be a great help for students. Fair is fair, and getting at least a B to play sports, or do other activities will make their parents happy, and maybe they will be too. I want to thank you for taking your time to read my letter, and I hope you'll go along with changing our school policy. This will help our school achieve more, and make it a better learning experience for everybody.

B7D68CD59B93,"Most schools have extracurricular activities, such as playing sports or working on the yearbook. Most students enjoy these activities and are grateful to have the chance to participate in them. In the majority of schools, a student is not required to take part in one of these activities. However, if the principal of a school were to decide that all students must participate in one, then their decision should be supported because the extracurricular activities will help students find new interests, they will allow them to meet people with similar interests, and skills such as teamwork will be encouraged.

One reason in support of a principal's decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities is that they help people find new interests. Often times, a student may assume that a certain activity is boring or a waste of their time. However, this is impossible to know until it is tried out. After trying it out, the student may realize that it is fun, and a great way to spend their free time. Sometimes, a student may simply think that they do not have the time to participate in a club or a sport after school. However, after doing it once and realizing how much they enjoy the activity, they may reconsider whether or not they do not have much time. Both of these scenarios result in the student having a good time, and this enjoyment can only be credited to the principal, as they are the reason why the student participated in an activity. So, by being forced to be in a club or sport, students will expand their amount of hobbies and interests.

Another reason why the principal made a good decision is that it will allow students to meet those with similar interests. If everyone has to do an extracurricular activity, they will all go to the one that they are most interested in. For example, those who like taking photos may go to yearbook club. Now, all of those who have the same hobbies are together, and they will most likely become friends, as they can bond over their interests. This was only possible because of the principal's decision to make students participate in extracurricular activities.

The last reason why the decision to make students participate in extracurricular activities was a good one is that it encourages skills, such as teamwork or persistence. In most sports, such as basketball or soccer, teamwork is a skill that is always used. The players must communicate with each other to make the best play. They must encourage each other, and keep them from getting nervous. Teamwork will also be used when students grow up. Many jobs will require employees to work in a team to complete their work. By practicing this skill earlier, students will be better prepared for when they grow up. Another skill that is encouraged is persistence. If one gives up after facing a problem, no work can get done. For example, if one is taking part in a mathematics club, they will have to solve a variety of problems. Some may seem like they have no solution. However, if the student gives up after they cannot find a solution, they will not learn anything. Also, they will be ill-prepared for when they grow up and face a myriad of other challenges. If, when they face these challenges, they just give up, they will not be able to do all they are supposed to do. By participating in extracurricular activities, students will not grow up without these skills, and can instead accomplish everything they need to, and more. The one who is responsible for this is the principal, who made students take part in these activities.

In conclusion, a principal's decision to require students to participate in extracurricular activities is a good one because students will find new interests, make new friends, and build skills that are absolutely necessary in adult life. By taking part in these activities, students will both enjoy themselves, and they will gain the skills needed throughout their life.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

I think there should be a rewards program for better grades. Something like the A B honor roll, but bigger. If you make the class with a passing grade you should be rewarded, with a chance to win something or a reward that you'll enjoy. You can always have money rewards or dance rewards or if you get straight A's you'll be in the school paper. Something big but not too big just to encourage students to try a little bit harder. If it doesn't work, try to make the prize or reward a little more wanted. Maybe randomly give off a electronic device, like an iPod or a laptop to one lucky person every semester. This will make people try more and more to get better grades.

If it doesn't work, try to contact their parents and let them convince their kids that they wont get anywhere without an education. Make more tutoring sessions. And tell the teacher to help ones who need it.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
2D49C0B1DE8E,"The use of cellular phones has spread substantially the last ten years. It has become a part of everyday life for many Americans. Unfortunately, the use of cellphones for everyday life a lot of the times, takes place in cars. As a result, many accidents have taken place due to the use of cellular phones while on the road. Many people are not aware of just how serious this has become, which is why people should not be allowed to use phones in cars without a hands free device.

The use of phones while driving not only puts the person driving in danger, but all the people around them. It takes one person to make one decision that can affect the lives of many.

People do not take into consideration the horrible facts about accidents caused by cell phones when choosing to use their phones. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. It also states that nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving and 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk, but people still to this day do not think about the possible consequences of phones and driving.

Phones are not always a bad thing in cars, when following the right protocols. They help with navigation, communication, and are vital in the event of an emergency. Many states have banned the use of using a cell phone in any manner without a hands free device, which has decreased the amount of phone caused accidents. This law, although a struggle for some to follow, ultimately has everyone's best interest. People everywhere should be educated about the dangers of cell phone use in cars and about safer alternatives, and should be punished for not using a safer solution.

As seen, driving while talking on the phone is very dangerous. Also, with new laws if you're caught, you can be fined and could ultimately get your driver's license suspended. People can avoid all this trouble by only talking on your mobile phone when you are parked and out of the way of traffic. It could save your life one day. The use of a hands-free kit with your mobile phone as you drive doesn't eliminate risk, as you still might be distracted, but it does help cut it down. Driving a car is dangerous enough without adding still more risk by texting or talking and it is important that people are aware of that    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
995452515AB0,"The Importance of Positive Attitudes in Life

As an eighth-grade student, I have learned that having a positive attitude is crucial in all aspects of life. Whether it is in the workplace, at school, or in my personal life, having a positive attitude can make a huge difference in achieving success. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and importance of having a positive attitude and examine examples of positive attitudes in professional, personal, and family life.

Firstly, having a positive attitude can lead to better mental health. Research has shown that people who have a positive outlook on life tend to have lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This is because they focus on the good things in their lives and are less likely to dwell on negative situations. For example, a person who has a positive attitude towards their job may be more likely to handle stress and difficult situations better than someone who has a negative attitude.

Secondly, having a positive attitude can improve productivity and performance. When people have a positive outlook on life, they tend to be more motivated and focused on achieving their goals. This can lead to better performance in their personal and professional lives. For instance, a student who has a positive attitude towards school may be more likely to study harder and perform better academically. Similarly, an employee who has a positive attitude towards their job may be more likely to work harder and achieve success in their career.

Thirdly, having a positive attitude can improve relationships. When people have a positive outlook on life, they tend to be more empathetic and understanding towards others. This can lead to better relationships with family, friends, and colleagues. For example, a person who has a positive attitude towards their family may be more likely to have a good relationship with their parents and siblings. Similarly, an employee who has a positive attitude towards their colleagues may be more likely to have a good working relationship with them.

Finally, having a positive attitude can lead to success in all aspects of life. When people have a positive outlook on life, they tend to be more optimistic about their future and are more likely to take risks and pursue their dreams. This can lead to success in their personal and professional lives. For instance, a person who has a positive attitude towards their career may be more likely to take on new challenges and pursue opportunities that may lead to success.

6D104CA14B33,"Sure, here's my essay on the advantages of graduating early from high school and working for one year before going to college:

As an 8th grader, I've often thought about my future and what I want to do after high school. Some of my friends are already talking about college, but I'm considering taking a different path. I've heard that graduating early from high school and working for one year before going to college can have a lot of advantages. In this essay, I'll explain why I think this is a good idea and how it can help me in the long run.

First of all, graduating early from high school and working for one year can help me save money for college. I know that college is expensive, and my parents can't afford to pay for it all on their own. By working, I can earn money and put it towards my college fund. This way, I'll be able to pay for some of my college expenses myself, which will make my parents happy and help me avoid taking out as many loans. Plus, the money I earn can help me learn how to manage my finances and budget for my own expenses, which is an important skill to have in college.

Another advantage of graduating early and working is that it can make me more mature. I know that college is a big step, and I want to be ready for it. By working, I'll be able to gain some independence and learn how to take care of myself. I'll also be able to develop my time management skills, which will be essential in college. I'll have to balance my classes, homework, and a part-time job, so I'll need to learn how to prioritize my tasks and make sure I have enough time for everything.

Of course, there are some potential negatives to graduating early and working before college. Some people might say that I'll miss out on the traditional high school experience, like prom and senior trip. But I think that by working, I'll be able to save up for these experiences and make them even more special. Plus, I'll be able to focus on my studies and prepare for college in a more focused way.

93552F3ACA5D,"The limitation of human contact has been a negative effect in peoples lives; people are so caught up in today's technology that no one really talks in person anymore. People do anything on phones, but it has negative things to using them a lot: dating people through text, and less communication in real life and more over text. While most people believe that technology has positive effects in reality, it is mostly a negative effect.

Technology is not a good thing in certain situations. It is better to get to know people in person rather than social media or anything. No one knows who someone is until they meet them in person because some people lie to make someone like them. Technology can hurt people in different ways: physical, emotional, or any other way. People tend to do things to hurt the other person online rather than to their faces.

Some people decide to date someone through social media when it isn't a good idea to do. People can fake identities to make people think they're another person. people decide to not say who they really are, so they could either kidnap them or make the person they're tricking to send them money if they live in another country. It's rare that people find someone who doesn't lie about who they are. Some people probably decide to date through social media because they think that they won't find anyone who will really like them.

Most people who have technology now use them to communicate with other people instead of in person. Most people decide to communicate through online or text so that they don't see the person's face. People feel more brave to tell a person something mean or hurtful through text or anything. People just decide to not talk, but instead to text.

I am writing to you today on the subject of community service. I do not support this requirement, not because i think it is bad, but the time it would take would be too much for some students. Some students are already very busy, and adding community service projects would just make it busier, and harder on them. Some students play sports, and have practices every night, others have band rehearsals. On top of all that, they all have homework, putting required community service projects on top of all that would confuse us students, we would have trouble focussing on our academics if we have to worry about getting so many things done. I myself am in many extracurricular activities, i play many sports, i play in the band, and i sing in the choir, i have a sports practice every night, and i have homework to do after that. To me, requiring community service would set me over the limit. I myself am already extremely busy every night, and having to worry about getting my community service projects done would be too much for me to handle. i also have many friends that play many sports, and other things.

According to the passage""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral college is a process, not a place. This means that it is not in a certain place it is all over the United States.Â  The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualififed citizens.Â  The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

Admittedly, I feel that we should keep the Electoral College because it will help us with the voting process.Â  According to the passage"" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer he states that under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president.Â  As a result I feel that this isnt much of an issue for us citizens because if you make the right choice then they will vote for your president.Â  So if you think about it there really isnt much of an issue because your president will still have your vote. The Electoral College is widely regarded as a non-democartic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner.

Proceeding further, the Electoral College is based of the electors you pick and then they decide of who becomes president by the popular vote.Â  When you are voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.Â  Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.

In conclusion, the electoral college is about voting for electors and then they become president if enough popular votes are met.Â  Some people like thisÂ  method and then some of the people dont.Â  We all have our opinion by mine is i like this method.

First off, let's talk about distance learning.  It's like, where you don't actually go to school in a classroom, but instead, you learn from home or wherever you want!  Like, you can watch videos, listen to lectures, and even take quizzes and tests online! It's like, super convenient, right? ð

An example we can call our parents if we need some thing or text them for emergency's, or just to say I love you. Say no ones perfect and if you are a really person you do forget things and what one good way to get what you need when you leave something? Text your mom during lunch time.

People at school get hurt all the time and say the office needs to know your mom or dad's cell phone and they didn't put it on the card? We students could use our phones so nothing bad would really happen cause you mom is all ready here and got what you need. I think we should have phones at school to call for rides and call home to see if we can go with our friend or say some guy comes and say your mom wanted me to pick you up and you didn't know him? If you had your cell phone with you, you can call her up and see if this is true or not so have an cell phones could keep you safe for many reasons.

95540EBC3FC9," Education has always been an essential part of our lives, and every school offers classes to support students' natural abilities. However, not all students are interested in arts, and enrolling in such classes can be a waste of time for them. On the other hand, it is crucial for students to take a break from their studies to recharge their energy and reduce stress. Therefore, taking classes in art can be a great way to achieve this goal.

However, it is essential to note that not all students are interested in art, and enrolling in such classes can be a waste of time for them. It is important to make these classes elective, so that students can choose to take them based on their interests and abilities. This way, students who are not interested in art can focus on other subjects that they are more passionate about.

Moreover, taking classes in art can have numerous benefits for students. Firstly, it can help them clean up their brains, which can improve their ability to absorb information in the following block. For instance, after a long and intense block of studying, taking a break to sing, act, or draw can help students relax their brains and feel ready to absorb more information.

Secondly, taking classes in art can help students increase their efficiency in adopting information. It depends on their type of favorite in entertainment that their bodies and brains can feel relaxed when they are into it. For example, some students may prefer singing, while others may prefer acting or drawing.

In conclusion, taking classes in art can be a great way for students to recharge their energy and reduce stress after a long day of studying. However, it is essential to make these classes elective, so that students can choose to take them based on their interests and abilities. By doing so, we can ensure that students are not wasting their time in classes that they are not interested in, and that they are able to focus on subjects that they are more passionate about.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

A369CA765144,"Have you ever mad a bad choice and needed advice to help you make a better choice ? Sometimes we all make make bad choices and dont think before we do. However its important think it out clearly or talk to somebody you feel secured with. I once made a bad choiceÂ in class but i talked to my school consular and was all better for the rest of that day.

However, theres different people you could go to for advice. Also theres different places or things you could use to get your mind off of something so you could make that better choice and dont get mixed up in trouble. One person you could go to for advice is a home counselor or school counselor. Counselors, are very helpful if your parent is working and you feel angry or sad and feel like you about to make and bad descions your counselor could help. They could take you out for something to eat and talk to you about the problem you having. They could even put you in a program too keep you focused.

Also, a second thing that could help you out is talking to your love ones. Me personally i think talking to your mom and dad. And most of the time people act different ways because they lost a loved one or somebody not in there life that they need to be there for them. And good things your loved ones could do to help you out they could take you shopping and buy you something you like to make you feel loved and know that someone is here for you. sometime theirs very hard trying to talk to someone so its very important that you go to somebody thats easy to talk to and understands you for good advice.

Next, i think something that could help you out and could take your mind off certain things is a vacation with your whole family. You could have quality time and know that your love you and tell your family about what been going on and they maybe could have a solution to help you out.

Also why your on your vacation you could explore different things and get enjoy different great activities. you may even get closer to one of your family members and you start to come come to them more for advice.

In conclusion, sometimes it may be hard not to make bad choice but its always great to to talk to someone you trust for advice. however sometimes it may not be a bad thing it may just be for and ordinary thing like needing helping pick out a pair of shoes or a shirt and you need advice so you can have a better choice. Therefore next time if you need advice to make a better choiceÂ just go to a relative or an friend So next time, you could understand.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
93EF5F755313,"The statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" is a quote attributed to former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. This quote suggests that success is not about avoiding failure, but rather about persevering through it. In this essay, I will explore whether this statement is true and consider both reasons for believing it is true and counterarguments that it is not necessary to fail to learn and succeed.

On the one hand, there are several reasons to believe that Churchill's statement is true. Firstly, learning from mistakes is essential for growth and development. When we fail, we gain valuable insights into what went wrong and what we can do differently next time. This allows us to improve and become better at what we do. Secondly, perseverance is crucial for success. It takes time and effort to achieve our goals, and we often encounter obstacles and setbacks along the way. Without the ability to push through these challenges, we may give up and never achieve our objectives. Finally, enthusiasm is a key factor in achieving success. When we are enthusiastic about what we are doing, we are more likely to put in the effort and persevere through difficulties.

On the other hand, there are also counterarguments to Churchill's statement. For example, some people argue that it is not necessary to fail in order to succeed. They believe that success can be achieved through hard work, dedication, and determination, without the need for failure. Additionally, some people argue that failure can be demotivating and lead to a loss of enthusiasm, rather than the opposite.

In conclusion, while Churchill's statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" is a powerful one, it is not without its flaws. There are valid counterarguments to this statement, and it is important to consider both sides of the argument when evaluating its truthfulness. Ultimately, success is a complex and multifaceted concept, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving it.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,4
908906779AB1,"All my life I've always had to school. From Pre-K all the way up until now. People who complete school at home are normally actors, students who move a lot and don't really have time to go to school and people who suffer from illnesses. Some people argued that having kids attend class from home wouldn't benefit them from learning. However they are wrong because students, especially in college, have video conferences with their teachers fit hey aren't able to make it to class due to health related problems, family emergencies,

Having an illness can sometimes get in the way especially when it comes to school. My big sister and I, we are the only ones who have a chronic illness in our family. She has C.F and type 2 Diabetes while I have Lupus and heart problems. Everyday is hard for us because we try to keep our health in check and try to maintain our grades in school. My sister is currently in College, she goes to Generic_School, and as of right now she is in the hospital, she has gotten sick again. Every time my sister goes into the hospital, she has to complete her work online because she isn't able to be in class. My sister hates going to the hospital because when she's in the hospital its hard for her to get her work done because every 45 minutes she has to do something. So now she put a 'do not disturb from 9:00 am - 1:30 pm' sign on her door so she can complete her work. So especially with her being in the hospital, we don't think that having students work from home is an issue.

For me its different, the only time when I'm not at school its because I'm either at a doctors appointment or I have to unexpectedly go to the hospital. Whenever I'm not at school i do all my work ahead of time on an app that my school has called schoology. Schoology helps me turn in my work, stay organized, it tells me when things are do and what is over due. I normally try to do all my work in school or when i'm with my mom at home because if i try to complete my homeworkÂ or school work when i'm alone, I get distracted and my work doesn't get done. Unless I'm with an adult and they're making sure I do my work its hard for me to focus.

If I had a choice I would choose to do my school work online, it would be easier and better for me. Being at school makes me uncomfortable. I don't really like a lot off people and I don't really get along with a lot of people.

Being in Generic_school doesn't really help at all. It helps prepare me for my future but it also takes a toll on my body. When I'm in a class with really smart people it make me feel as if I'm below them and with me trying to make my mom proud, I push myself mentally a physically. At school I'm under a whole bunch of stress and pressure trying to pack work into one day so I can get it done. Nobody really understand what I go through so I try to be strong so I can make others happy. When things don't turn out how I want it, I get upset ad let all my emotions go. It hard trying to stay positive all the time. Where as if I'm at home I can be free complete things on my time, I can take time on my assignments, I don't have to compare myself to others, and I can be me. At home there is no one to judge and I feel more comfortable to work at home. People, parents, like to argue that being in school helps children physically and mentally. However they are incorrect because adults have no idea how much tress and pressure they'reÂ putting in their children. On the outside ewe smile and act like everything is okay while on the inside we're tired, broken and misunderstood. We always try to do what's best for our teachers and make our teachers proud that we forget that we are human too and we have to listen to ourselves and do what's best for us.

Therefore, Schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. completing task or classes online helps students when they are sick, have health issues, move a lot, and or aren't financially wealthy to go to school then they should be allowed to take classes online. As person whoÂ as health issues I feel as though all student should get the choice if the want to complete school online or not. Its their choice and nobody can force them but some parents force their children to go to school, work hard and do everything they can to have a better future. Adult just need to realize they can't always control children to do what they want, they need to let children live and experience stuff on their own. All school should have the choice for a child to take classes online as an alternative. Students can makeÂ thier ownÂ decisions when it come to how they want attend school.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
C4086056BD37," High School

High school typically spans four years, with grades ranging from 9th to 12th. However, some schools offer accelerated programs that allow students to graduate in just three years. These programs provide students with three options for graduation: summer school, evening school, or not taking any elective courses.

The first reason why I believe that finishing high school in three years is a better option for students is that high school students are often teenagers and need time to pursue personal interests and engage in extracurricular activities. By completing high school in three years, students can have more time to explore their passions and gain valuable life experiences before moving on to college.

Secondly, many high school students work part-time to save money for college. Finishing high school in three years can allow these students to work for a year after graduation and still be able to attend college with the same amount of savings. This can be a significant advantage for students who may not have the financial means to support themselves during their college years.

Lastly, students who choose to graduate in three years may have more options when it comes to finding a good college and a place to live near their families. This can be especially important for students who may not have the financial means to attend college out of state.

In conclusion, while finishing high school in three years may not be the best option for all students, it can provide a number of advantages for those who are looking to attend college and pursue their personal interests. By offering accelerated programs that provide students with more options and opportunities, schools can help students make the most of their high school years and prepare them for a successful future.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

29F53618A9F7,"Dear Principal,

I think we should make it required that all students perform community service. Some people may think that it takes too much time, but i don't think so. Yes, it does take time away from things you want to do, but helping people in need is probably the best way out.

Taking part in community service helps people in need or helps the community in general. For example, we could help clean up litter on our school grounds to make our school look amazing and make it better for the environment. The school could tutor the elementary kids with math and reading.

Community service is a awesome way to show that you care about your surroundings. We can show that we care by planting flowers in front of the school, picking up trash, recycling, and many more. If we all work together and try to make an effort then we can do community service all the time.

Making community service required sounds like a good idea to me. It could help people, the environment, maybe even the world. People aren't even trying to do it today. Making it required could help that. It could push people into helping others. Eventually we could not make it required and it wouldn't be a problem, they would see that community service is fun and it makes you feel good inside.

I hope you see that we need to make it required.

Thank you,

19637A48A8CE,"With the new use of technology, the ability to read someones emotion by the simpliest look is within our grasp. The ability to read your emotion is easy as said done. Why not put something like this that can read out faces inside school. Traspass their privacy. Even so, during school it would not come in handy with any student anytime during the day. Being watched by a face recongnition in the home of many, is an event many would not agree with.

During the school year, for example, a high school. Where would a Facial Action Coding System fit into? This would not benifit our education other than waste it. The new technology being used on students to detect their emotions is a privacy violation. Students would not want their face being read and pictured by a new face detection. For example, in the story it says, ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" With this being said, this technology invades our space. Some students don't want their emotions being let out; they might want it to keep that private information to themselves, unless they realease it by themselves. This could happen to anyone, even without them realizing it. For example, sitting in the right position across from the Facial Action Coding System, the victims emotion may be violated without their concent. In the story it reads, ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a smiliar ad might follow. But if ou frown, the next ad will be different."" This text shows a program reading your face in real time for all the time you are on your own laptop. Having your own computer reading your face every second while being in your own home would not be welcomed to many. It's a violation to privacy to use and our freedom.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would not be of use for students. Our minds and face are focused in a different direction rather than facing this machine to read out emotions. Whether this new technology is useful or not, it would not be of good use for a classroom full of faces.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
5EB43212A8DC,"Summer, the time every student looks forward to after being in school for several months. Unfourtanetly certain schools are requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they're continuing to learn during their break. There is a debate whether or not the assignments should be teacher-designed or student-designed. The assignments should be student-designed because their summer is already being interrupted by school projects, so the students having freedom with the project will motivate them to do it, the project will be more enjoyable because it will be a topic they like, and it will allow creativity.

Students will be disappointed that they go to school for roughly ten months out of the year, and the two months they do have off are filled with school related assignments. That's why having a student-designed project will allow the students to take a different perspective of the assignment. The students having a choice will motivate them to do the project because it will be something they enjoy. Most summer based assignments would be reading a teacher chosen novel and doing an assignment based off of it. No student wants to spend their summer reading a novel they don't find an interest in and then writing a paper about it. However they wouldn't necessarily mind doing an assignment if it corresponds with the vacation they're going on and a school subject they enjoy. Giving students a choice allows them to dig deeper and the outcome will be greater and it will allow a greater amount of success.

Another reason the summer projects should be student-designed is that students will find more joy in working with an assignment they like. Every student is different therefore they will appreciate the fact they get to do a project that appeals to them. This will also allow the teachers to learn about their students more at the beginning of the year, what they like, and what works for them. Students need a break to relax and let their brain interpret all the information they have learned during the previous school year, so loading them down with assignments is not going to help them recover. Having a student-designed project will give students the opportunity to learn and think about school but at the same time not be overwhelmed and have a negative outlook towards doing the project for school.

Having a student-designed assignment also allows the students to get creative and expand learning outside of the classroom. It will allow the teachers to see what the students are capable of. Additionally the teachers would enjoy grading the projects because all of them would be different. However the teachers will disagree and want a teacher-designed assignment because they will want the project to be organized and structured. Teachers would want to make sure effort is being put into the project and the students are retaining information from it. There will be many assignments during the school year for the teachers to plan assignments so during the break the students should be trusted to design their own.

Summer is what every student looks forward to, the fun vacations and plans they have. They're not going to want to complete a dreadful assignment. The students should be held capable of designing their own summer project so they will have more motivation to complete it, they will be able to find joy in it, and they will be able to think with an open-mind and become creative.Â    Â  Â  Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
BF56324B3A86,"Do you know how many people are unhappy for be someone that they don't are?. At the present time in the world exist millions of people that don't live their life of the way that they want. Sometimes is difficult be yourself in a world where the whole people think that be different is wrong, but the truth is that the greatest accomplishment in the life of each human is be unique and have individuality in all your presence, because be yourself is the goal of the happiness, fight against the prejudice of everyone is not easy and accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you.

Many people think that have a success and amazing life is have a lot of money, be an important person or have material things but all this things in really don't matter in the process of be yourself, because a person can have all this things but this things don't define you like a person and this aspects don't give the happiness, and something very important in the life of everyone is that, if you don't have happiness you don't have nothing. Is a fact that at least the 60 percent of people is not happy with their life, but studies affirm that this can change just if they choose be hones with themselves and take out of their life want they don't want. And the first step to be happy is be yourself. The people don't can live being liar with themselves, because this just bring like consequence a miserable life. A person have to accept their personality and their interest based on their thoughts. A serious consequence that the people get if they don't be honest with themselves are diseases like depression, This is a very dangerous problem and one of the most common causes are don't be agreeable with the person or the way that the person is living. For this and many others reasons is that is very difficult be yourself but is the biggest reward.

Alongside of your life you have to make a lot of decisions and is important always hear you. The people cannot allow that someone take decisions for they if that affect who are they.

First is very important know exactly what do you want because that is the same that be happy with yourself.

Always take your own opinion first, is the answer of be really happy because is very easy follow the opinion of the others based in their life's or be influenced for a world that always is trying to make you someone else, someone that they don't are. But at the end what a person want is the answer of be really happy.

Everyone in the world is trying to find their correct way in their life, and be honest about feelings and all mentioned in this paragraph can be the answer to arrive to the goal and be happy with yourself.

Is a fact that actually the world is a constantly war, because the majority of the citizens in the world are trying to fight for their rights and be honest with themselves and also with the whole world. But is true that this is not a easy task. The only person that someone need worry about what they going to think is yourself!, a person don't have to worry about the opinion of the others, just care what do you think!. Unfortunately, not everyone understand this, and sometimes the people wants that the world accept us form the simple fact of be a person. Is very hard be like you really are if millions of people want change your mind and they refuse to accept that everyone is different, that there are things that don't have that be equal and that it's fine, that the diversity is part of a balance. Everyone is here, in their country, in their community to learn about the others, and have respect of they, don't care their race, color, language, traditions, customs and many others things that represent and define a person, this is the correct, not be equal. Nowadays a lot of people is trying to make this world a better place where the prejudices not exist and where each person can be what they want and have the rights that the people need and deserve. Is a difficult battle but without doubt the result is the greatest accomplishment. And is a fact that if the people are happy with how they are, and they accept their form of be, with their qualities and defects, anyone, and studies repeat that anyone can affect you, because you are really on the top of the goal and when you are there nothing can make you go down.

Many philosopher and researchers believe that the problem with the society that don't accept and allow the people that is different, is because since the beginning of the world the people hidden their really feelings and interests for the fear of be rebounded. In part is own fault because the people never said something when something was wrong, but never is late, an actually the majority of the people is trying to change the perspective about what is fine in the world. That is why accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you. We have to be strong and don't allow that anyone dispute your decisions. Another reason therefore is hard be yourself is for you, sometime the people are so exigent with themselves, you are your own most hard critical. If everyone would honest with themselves , this would be something normal for the society, but is such difficult accept us, that is seen wrong be unique. We definitely have to change this way of see the circumstances and make it normal.

Is clearly that we have a lot of learn but I think that we going to the correct way. The people have to travel many obstacles for win their individuality and always remember where we are and where we want arrive.

Be yourself, is really difficult if a whole society is telling you that you can not be different and that be unique is wrong, because how you can understand who are you, if anyone give you the chance to know it, but without doubt discover the answer will be the best accomplishment that a person can have because live being you, is the better that could exist, for a complete life.",0,original_moth,"Task:

F347A054A1AF,"Having a positive attitude is crucial to being successful in life. It is the foundation upon which we build our dreams, aspirations, and achievements. A positive attitude allows us to approach challenges with a sense of optimism, resilience, and determination, which can lead to greater opportunities and success.

Being responsible is an essential aspect of having a positive attitude. When we are responsible, we take ownership of our actions and their consequences. We are accountable for our mistakes and work to correct them, rather than blaming others or making excuses. Responsibility allows us to develop a sense of self-discipline and self-control, which are important qualities for achieving success. For example, a responsible student who consistently does their homework and studies effectively will likely perform better academically and have a better chance of achieving their goals.

Amusement is another aspect of having a positive attitude. When we have a sense of humor and can find joy in the little things, we are better able to cope with stress and adversity. Laughter can help us relax and recharge, and it can also bring people together and foster positive relationships. For example, a person who has a positive outlook and can find humor in their daily life is more likely to have a strong support system and be able to navigate challenging situations.

Interesting is the final aspect of having a positive attitude. When we are interested in learning and growing, we are more likely to seek out new opportunities and take risks. We are more open to new experiences and ideas, which can lead to greater creativity and innovation. For example, an individual who is interested in pursuing a career in a particular field is more likely to put in the hard work and dedication necessary to achieve success.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is essential to being successful in life. It allows us to approach challenges with a sense of optimism, resilience, and determination, which can lead to greater opportunities and success. Being responsible, amusing, and interesting are all aspects of having a positive attitude that can help us achieve our goals and dreams. By cultivating a positive attitude, we can create a more fulfilling and successful life for ourselves and those around us.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,4
D33CD8778DE7,"Cars that can drive themselves?

Is a driverless car really a good idea? Manufacturing a driverless car has not even been a succeding task. Cars that can drive on their own still require an alert driver at times. If the self driving car was manufactured laws would have to be changed, the company and the owner would have issues if a crash did accure, and the owner possibly needed to be alert may not stay alert. The self driving car needs more time before being tried out with actual costumers.

The driverless car manufactured by google has made it half a million miles without a crash. However drivers still are alerted to take over the wheel when parking, navigating traffic, or road construction. What could happen if a ""driverless"" car alerted the owner but they weren't alert and did't take they wheel in time? Major accidents could be caused from this. A driver not focused on the road could put in danger themselves and other drivers around them.

If the driver was'nt alert and an accident did accure, both the company and owner would be in seriouse trouble. Certian laws would have to be made or changed to solve this issue. If there was a crash with two cars would one of the drivers be of blame as they are now or would both companies be blamed. Technology has instences when it doesn't work. Everyone has yelled at a phone or T.V before. Though when that technology doesn't work properly it's not a life or death situatiuon. Also how expensive would this be? It's well known how expensive a phone, T.V, or new computer can be. It would be too expensive to make them the sale price would have to bring back the money spent to manufacture one and the sales person would need money to actually make for the work. How many people could ctually afford it. The people it would help most likely can't even come up with the money to get one.

With the rate of accidents now drivers barely stay alert when they have the wheel. But knowing, or thinking, they have the freedom to do as they please while the car drives itself they will lose focus. Drivers won't pay attention to the road. People have way to much trust in their technology they wont even think of what would happen when they have to drive. How owuld they react if they tried to take a nap and was awaken to take the wheel? they may not have enough time to even think of what they need to do to avoid an accident.

What would be the point of a driverless car? Reduce the number of drunk drivers on the road maybe. Or give people who can't drive the transportation they need without public transports. This would all be great! But what would happen when the car needed them to take over. Of course you'd still need to go through training and so on to get your liscnes so people who have the inability to drive may it be physical will have no prevail in it. Also if a drunk driver was alerted they would still be driving after drinking. The only ones that coul use this technology are the ones that can already drive. Then what is the point of the driverless car anyway? There's too many saftey dangers and pointless reasons to start manufacturing a driverless car.            ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
72de1467,"The electoral College is something in the United States that needs to be replaced. It is an irrational system that takes the people's power to vote away from them. The system has flaws that leave the possibility of disaster open to happen. It takes the power to choose the government officials from the people, and gives it to a group of people who can vote either way. Why would we keep this?

The electoral College is a way to choose the Presidential candidate who wins the election. It involves a slate of electors according to Source 2 who cast their votes in. The people in each state vote for the winning electors of that state. The electors pledge to a candidate and thats what people vote for. Once the people choose a winning elector group they go to Congress and cast their votes in for who they want, and that person then gets so many votes. The problem is that the electors aren't required to vote for who they said they would, so if the elector suddenly decided to change his mind after he or she won, the people's votes are basically invalidated and a different elector gets the votes. This effectively removes the people from the equation in who gets elected. All an elector would have to do is win over the people, then he or she could just change their minds and cast a different vote than what they said they were going to do. The people who vote don't even vote for the Presidential candidate in this system, they vote for a bunch of electors that they hope will vote for what they said.

This is not an irrational, unrealized fear. It has actually happened before. According to Source 3, in the 2000 election, Al Gore had a majority of popular votes, but less electoral votes, so he lost to Bush. This isn't even the first time it has happened, it has happened previous times throughout U.S. history. This is a clear example of how flawed the electoral College system. Between the possibility of the people's votes not counting for anything, and that they don't even actually vote for their preffered candidate, this system needs to be replaced.

Some may argue that the chance of an elector not casting his or her vote that he pledged to is very slim. Why would you even be ok with taking such a chance? It's better to be onehundred percent sure of what will happen instead of ninetyfive percent. Also, since most states in the U.S. award electoral votes by a winnertakesall basis according to Source 3, if one side of the votes wins, even by a slim margin, they get all the votes. This seems unfair, since if they won by a slim margin at least some of the state thinks it should be a different vote. It would make more sense if the states awarded both sides of the vote if it was a close win for one side or the other, but they would award the true winner with more votes than the narrow loser.

Another problem with the E.C. system is that states that are largely of one belief Republican or Democrat ect. have no real reason to pay attention to the opposite side of the canidacy. Since the state would be largely one thing or the other, it is irrelivant if thirty percent of the state votes one way if seventy percent of the state votes the other, since the landslide victory style of electoral vote giving is present in most states. This also means that states that are biased and small states get almost no exposure from the opposite side of the canidacy because they know they have almost no chance of winning their votes. This seems to force the voters to choose one candidate's electors because they don't know enough about the other.

In conclusion, the electoral College needs to be replaced with a more fair, balanced system. It has the potential to allow the electors to defy the will of the people who voted them in, invalidating the people's votes and making them pointless. It also has candates only focusing their ads and visits on the states with more votes and the states biased towards their party. Finally, it has almost all the states have a landslide ""winnertakes_all"" style of awarding electoral votes. This means if one side of electors only wins by a slim margin, the other side gets nothing, even though since they lost by a small number they clearly have a sizeable amount of voters for them. The electoral College needs to be removed before someone takes advantage of it's serious flaws and takes the votes of the people and makes them useless.",0,train_essays,,1
falcon_180b_v1_463,"I believe that arts education is crucial for a well-rounded education. Arts education helps students develop creativity and critical thinking skills that are necessary in every subject. It also allows students to express themselves in ways that they cannot in other classes.

Firstly, the arts help students develop their creativity. The arts teach students to see the world in different and unique ways, which is essential for problem-solving. In addition, the arts help students develop their imaginations, which is necessary for innovation.

Secondly, arts education teaches students critical thinking. In the arts, students must evaluate their work and the work of others. They must analyze and interpret different pieces of art to understand the underlying messages. This type of critical thinking is necessary in all subjects and helps students to become better learners.

Finally, the arts allow students to express themselves in ways that they cannot in other classes. For example, students who struggle with language or written communication can express themselves through visual arts or music. This type of expression can help students build confidence and improve their communication skills.

In conclusion, arts education is essential for a well-rounded education. It helps students develop creativity and critical thinking skills that are necessary in all subjects. It also allows students to express themselves in ways that they cannot in other classes. Therefore, arts education should be considered as a mandatory subject in schools.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Many people believe that arts education is essential for a well-rounded education, while others think that it should be optional.

10D09AB4D6C7,"Extracurricular activities have been a controversial topic of discussion for decades. Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities. I attend Generic_School, a place where students have many extracurricular activities to choose from, all of which take place after the school day is over. Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all

Generic_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else. This decree has denied the freedom of choice to not only me, but hundreds of other students at my school with regards to extracurricular activities. I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal on this matter because forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities exhausts students and tremendously decreases the time that aÂ student has to complete schoolwork assigned to them.

Generic_School students should not have to regularly participate in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students time to relax, it depletes their energy. Generic_School students are tired as it is. To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me. I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep. Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can. That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them.

Generic_School students should not have to consistently partake in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students a sacred time and place to complete schoolwork, it massively decreases work and study time. At Generic_School Middle School, there is a particular extracurricular activity called ""Generic_Name's Work Zone"" or ""WWZ."" WWZ is a place where students are able to sit down and complete schoolwork. Those that attend for the sole purpose of doing work choose to do so at Generic_Name's Work Zone rather than at home because WWZ is a silent work area, which should aid concentration. The problem is that most Generic_School students who attend do not come there to do work or to study but to instead play games which can distract those who are trying to work. Trust me, I know from experience. I could not do more than 30 minutes of work before being sucked into my cell phone. WWZ lasts for an hour, only half of which I used for work. That is why I stopped going. However, I do not have that option anymore now that I must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and somehow make time to work without being distracted, however difficult it may be.Â That is why Generic_School students should not have to routinely attend extracurricular activities because it takes work and study time away from them.

I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal because forcing Generic_School students to participate in extracurricular activities wears them out and decreases the time that a Generic_School student has to finish assigned work. First of all, extracurricular activities melt a student's energy and can negatively impact a student's health and well-being. Second, extracurricular activities lead to students being distracted, ultimately depleting work and study time. Extracurricular activities were supposed to be a way to help students complete work, come to school happier, and get better grades. However, force-feeding extracurricular activities to Generic_School students will not produce the desired effect that my principal hopes it will, and that is a fact.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

F798E16BB54C,"In the artical "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" tells about a techonlogy called the Facial Action Coding System, which is a system that tells peoples emotions from a degital screen. When knowing this technology can read faces, may it be possible to read amung students' emotion in a classroom?

Facial Action Coding System is a ""3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human mucles"". It has to move all of it's muscles in the 3-D computer to determind a facaial a human is making while using the facial gagit. We come across basic emotions like sad,anger, happy, and more that this gagit says can can pick up when scaning peoples faces, through the Facial Action Coding Systems. It even says in phargraph 3 ""Eckman has cassified six basic emotions--- happiness, suprise, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness--- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"".

When Knowing that, i dont think the mushcine could tell the students' emotion in a classroom. I only say that because, the Facial Action System can always make a slight mistake on judging how someone in that classroom feels. Just think, yes people can see others faces and make thier thoughts on what the person maybe feels, but also sometimes their judgment is wrong. I know the acticle tells me, and the other readers ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facaial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect Yet Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facaial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"" (in pharagrah 5). I still say it doesn't matter about the studies someone has done to, or on something, technology can make simple mistakes just like humans.

In parapraph two, you can even see the author asking the readers, ""Can we actually ""cauclulate"" emotions---like mathe homwork""? Then goes on with saying, ""And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel"". When saying that it just shows that the author, and probly others that have read this acticle isn't sure about this facial computer tool, looks can always be desiving so it hard to even trust technologys judging something simples as someones facial expression.

Some people just may think the Facial Action Coding System is a very great idea, and some may not think so. It's just to hard to get a good answer on whomevers feeling it's the right technology to use. This technology could, or couldn't help others determind someones facials in a classroom.                         ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
39E84A5734FF,"We need to keep the Electoral College because it keeps the elections fair. It keeps them fair by allowing the states to be proportionaly represented. Also it makes sure there will not be run-off elections and keeps the presidential candidates from favoring one region.

The Electoral College keeps the election fair because all states are represented proportianly to the population of the state. This allows for the smaller states to have a more impactfull vote on the president. Since each state is represented equally the election is more fair than if just a popular vote was taken. This system is called unfair by some because they think that their vote is not being heard. This is not true because in source one it says that when you are voting for a president, you are actually voting for who your electors are going to vote for. So if you vote say demcratic, thats a vote going toward the elector voting democratic in turn him or her voting democratic for the president.

If the president was elected by a popular vote, there is a risk of run-off elections as shown in case three when Nixion had 43 percent of the popular vote but won the Electoral College allowing for a fair winner to be elected. If we continue to use the Electoral College a clear winner will always be produces, but if we go by popular vote a run-off election can occur. Some people may say that the Electoral College is unfair because the winner of the popular vote may not win because of the Electoral College vote and that is not true. If the president was elected by popular vote he or she who is running can just go for the big states, win them over and all smaller states are left with no signifigant say in the election.

If the Electoral College was not used it would allow presidental candidates to favor different regions making it seem like he or she was just the souths president or the norths ect. So with the Electoral College it makes the candidates branch out to try and win more states that they usually would not try to appeal to. In source two the speaker says ""The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance winning. This statement is not true because the Electoral College forces the cadidates to branch out to get more votes. And if the runner knows he or she won't win that state why spend money and other reasources on a rewardless cause.

When all is considered about keeping the Electoral College the only answer should be to keep it. It keeps the election fair by giving smaller states a bigger impact. It keeps run-off elections from taking place, and makes the candidates branch out to other states.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
falcon_180b_v1_630,"""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is an article that provides evidence that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform and not a creation of aliens. In this essay, I will present claims and evidence to support the argument that the Face is not made by aliens.

The first claim is that the Face on Mars does not have any features that are unique to artificial structures. According to the article, scientists have studied the Face and found that it has the same texture as its surroundings, which means it is likely a result of natural erosion. This is supported by the fact that the Face has no straight lines or sharp angles, which are characteristics of man-made structures.

The second claim is that the size and position of the Face suggest that it is not an artificial structure. The article states that the Face is over one mile wide and is located in Cydonia, a region on Mars that is known for its volcanic activity. This means that the Face is likely a result of natural geological processes, rather than being created by aliens.

The third claim is that the idea that the Face was created by aliens is based on speculation and imagination, rather than scientific evidence. The article suggests that people who believe in the Face are often influenced by popular media and conspiracy theories, rather than by scientific facts. For example, some people have claimed that the Face resembles a human face, but this is just a coincidence.

In conclusion, the evidence presented in ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" supports the argument that the Face on Mars is not a creation of aliens. Instead, it is likely a natural landform that has been shaped by geological processes. This is supported by the fact that the Face does not have any unique features of artificial structures, it is located in an area known for volcanic activity, and the idea that it was created by aliens is based on speculation and imagination.

60AE13D3F07B,"Title: The Formation of Character Traits: The Role of Parents, Siblings, Friends, and School

As an 8th grader, I have always been curious about how our character traits are formed. It's like, how do we become the person we are today? Is it because of our parents, siblings, friends, or school? In this essay, I will discuss the influence of these factors on the development of our character traits.

Firstly, parents play a huge role in shaping our character traits. They are the first people we interact with, and they teach us right from wrong. They set the tone for our values and beliefs, and they are the ones who instill good habits in us. For example, if our parents are punctual, we are more likely to be punctual too. They also teach us how to handle emotions, how to communicate, and how to solve problems. My mom is really good at making me feel better when I'm sad, and my dad is great at teaching me how to be responsible.

Next, siblings are also important in shaping our character traits. They can be our best friends or our worst enemies, but either way, they have a big impact on us. They teach us how to share, how to take turns, and how to be patient. They also introduce us to new things, like sports or hobbies, and they help us develop our social skills. My sister is really good at drawing, and she taught me how to draw too. My brother is really good at playing video games, and he taught me how to play them too.

Friends are another important factor in the formation of our character traits. They are the people we spend most of our time with, and they have a big influence on how we think and behave. They teach us how to be kind, how to be loyal, and how to be honest. They also introduce us to new ideas and perspectives, and they help us develop our social skills. My best friend is really good at singing, and she taught me how to sing too. My other friend is really good at playing guitar, and he taught me how to play too.

Lastly, school plays a significant role in shaping our character traits. It's where we learn how to be responsible",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Research and discuss how character traits are formed in humans, paying particular attention to the influence of parents, siblings, friends, and school.",4
falcon_180b_v1_286,"I am a Grade 7 student and I believe that students should not grade their teachers. The reason for this is because students cannot be objective in their evaluations and may grade teachers based on factors that have nothing to do with their ability to teach.

One of the reasons why students should not grade their teachers is because they may not be able to evaluate their teachers fairly. For example, a student might have had a personal conflict with their teacher, which could affect their grading of the teacher. Additionally, a student might grade their teacher based on how easy or difficult the subject matter was, rather than the teacher's actual teaching ability. In other words, students may grade teachers based on their personal feelings rather than objective criteria.

Furthermore, students may not have the necessary knowledge or experience to evaluate their teachers properly. Teachers have gone through years of training and are experts in their field, whereas students may not be able to fully appreciate their expertise. For example, a student who is struggling in math might not understand why their teacher is using a particular teaching method, and may therefore rate their teacher poorly. However, the teacher might be using that teaching method because it has been proven to be effective.

In conclusion, I believe that students should not grade their teachers because they may not be able to evaluate them objectively and they may not have the necessary knowledge or experience to do so. Instead, evaluations of teachers should be left to trained professionals who can evaluate them based on objective criteria and provide feedback that can help teachers improve their teaching methods.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Some people believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers.

2083E1A7DEE8,"Dear Principal,

I believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school but can only use them at lunch and passing period. I believe this because if students are allowed to use their phones, they will appreciate school more and want to be here more and if they use them in class they will be confiscated.

One reason I think students should be able to use their phones is if they need to contact a parent/guardian, they can be able to communicate with them or need to get information from another student, they can have access to them

One example of what you should do to confiscate it would be to take it and a parent/guardian must pick up the phone. If caught twice will be kept till the end of the year. I the student is a caught the next year with their phone, it will be taken and given to them after graduation. Another example would be to take the phone each day they are caught with it and have them send a letter to the principal, their parents, and their teachers.

I believe that through this much information that you would consider letting students bring their phone on campus and let them use it during passing period and lunch.

BE6A28051A30,"Failure: The Stepping Stone to Success

As an 8th grader, I've learned that failure is not the end of the world. In fact, it's a crucial part of the journey to success. When we fail, we learn valuable lessons that help us grow and improve. Without failure, we wouldn't know what doesn't work and what does, and we wouldn't be able to reach our full potential.

Life can be tough and mean, and criticism from others can be hurtful. But instead of letting it get to us, we should use it as motivation to do better. When someone criticizes us, it's like they're giving us a chance to improve. We can take their feedback and use it to make ourselves better.

Self-determination and self-worth are also important in achieving success. When we believe in ourselves and our abilities, we're more likely to take risks and try new things. We're not afraid to fail because we know that failure is not the end of the world. And when we do fail, we get back up and try again, even harder.

Starting a new job can be tough, especially when we're not completely confident. But instead of letting our fear hold us back, we should embrace it. We can use our fear as motivation to work harder and prove ourselves. And when we do, we'll feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in ourselves.

Failure and success go hand in hand. When we fail, we learn what doesn't work, and when we succeed, we know what does. Failure helps us refine our skills and improve, and success gives us the confidence to keep going. Without failure, we wouldn't know what we're capable of, and without success, we wouldn't know how far we've come.

In conclusion, failure is not the enemy, it's a stepping stone to success. When we embrace failure and use it as motivation, we can achieve great things.

8F0C52187FE6,"Have you ever wanted to spend more time with your family? Well you may have that opportunity sometime in the future. Even as we go about our daily lives people somewhere are working to make that happen. With driverless cars we can spend more time with our family. The driverless car will no doubt help lessen the accidents caused by cars, it will also allow you to do something more important than driving on your way to and from work, and it will help keep your children under control because of you being able to talk to them about their actions in the backseat of your car.

Automated driving will help stop accidents from happening. Driverless cars are safer because they use sensors rather than the human attention span. Also driverless cars have an automatic brake system in a child or car got in front of the car at any time the car would be able to stop before collision. The cars will also allow everything to be more electronically inclined. If we get automated cars it will change how we live and our productivity.

While driving a car you have to pay a lot of attention to any hazards that may come along, and you don't have any time to work on the project for your workplace. While you are driving you could have been working on said project, but you couldn't due to the fact that you had to pay attention to the road. If we develope automated cars it will help bring work productivity up and sales along with it. The economy could really get a boost from them.

7EED34A43536," It is common for individuals to have both positive and negative aspects within themselves, leading them to question whether they should be true to themselves or not. On one hand, being oneself allows individuals to pursue their desires without regard for others, but on the other hand, the modern world presents many challenges and responsibilities that require individuals to adapt and change. While people have the right to make their own decisions, it is important to recognize that being oneself may not always be the best choice.

Firstly, individuals have their own choices to make. While some people may achieve success through their own decisions, others may simply live their lives without much thought or effort. However, it is important to remember that not being oneself does not necessarily change the physical world. For example, a person may have a dream of traveling the world, but they may not be able to achieve it due to the many responsibilities and challenges of the modern world. In such cases, it may be necessary to put one's dreams on hold and focus on the tasks at hand.

Secondly, individuals may need to change their lives at times. Some people may become stagnant and unfulfilled if they do not make changes to their lives. For instance, a person may have a desire to become a doctor, but may eventually lose interest in the job. In such cases, it may be necessary to seek out new opportunities and experiences that align with one's true passions. It is important to remember that work-life balance is essential, and individuals should not sacrifice their own happiness and well-being for the sake of their jobs.

Finally, it is important to recognize that over time, individuals may have to do things they do not enjoy. Tasks are often assigned by bosses or others in positions of authority, and individuals may not have much control over them. However, it is important to approach these tasks with a positive attitude and to use them as opportunities to learn and grow. For example, a young trainee may be tasked with menial jobs such as buying coffee or copying papers, but these tasks can help them develop important skills and gain valuable experience.

7cbf364f2b55_04112023,"Dear Principal, 

I am writing to respectfully provide my perspective on the proposed policy change to require students have at least a B average in order to participate in sports and extracurricular activities. While maintaining academic standards is important, implementing this policy could negatively impact students in several ways.

Requiring a B average may discourage students who are working hard but still achieving Cs from participating in important programs that foster skills like teamwork, leadership, communication and time management. Being involved in sports and clubs can help motivate students to succeed in the classroom as well. For some students, these activities may be what keeps them engaged and progressing toward graduation. Excluding students who are sincerely trying but facing academic challenges risks damaging self-esteem and potential. 

This policy could also place undue pressure on students already juggling busy schedules. Maintaining high grades is challenging, and extracurriculars offer healthy outlets for stress. Rather than incentives, stricter requirements may create anxiety that hinders performance. Students committed to both academics and activities will have to make sacrifices, losing opportunities for learning and growth. 

Instead of exclusion, I believe support and encouragement lead to greater success. Many students with C averages take difficult courses while excelling in other areas. A B cutoff does not consider individual circumstances or potential. Those committed to improvement could be banned for one slip. As an alternative, students below a B who meet regularly with teachers, attend study sessions, and show progress over time could qualify for conditional participation. 

In closing, while maintaining standards is important, this policy risks damaging morale and limiting opportunities rather than motivating growth. Most students are already highly motivated to succeed in the classroom and community. With guidance and flexibility instead of strict requirements, our dedicated students will continue to represent our school well in all their pursuits. I hope these perspectives will be considered in addressing the objectives of academic excellence and well-rounded student development.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,

EB0F373C1D2A,"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that schools should implement a 7-day break after every 2 weeks of schooling instead of a long 60-day summer break. While the idea of a long break may seem appealing, the benefits of a shorter break after every 2 weeks are numerous and cannot be ignored. In this essay, I will discuss the possible benefits of such an initiative and provide examples to support my arguments.

Firstly, a shorter break after every 2 weeks would allow students to maintain a consistent academic schedule. This means that students would not have to spend a significant amount of time catching up on missed work when they return to school. Instead, they would be able to continue their studies without interruption, which would ultimately lead to better academic performance. Additionally, a shorter break would also allow teachers to plan their lessons and curriculum more effectively, as they would not have to account for a long break in their planning.

Secondly, a shorter break after every 2 weeks would allow students to maintain their mental health and well-being. Research has shown that prolonged periods of stress and burnout can have negative effects on a student's mental health. By implementing a shorter break after every 2 weeks, students would be able to take a break and recharge their batteries, which would ultimately lead to better mental health and well-being. This, in turn, would lead to better academic performance and overall happiness in school.

Thirdly, a shorter break after every 2 weeks would allow students to pursue extracurricular activities more effectively. Many students participate in sports, clubs, and other extracurricular activities, which can be time-consuming and require a significant amount of commitment. By implementing a shorter break after every 2 weeks, students would be able to balance their academic and extracurricular responsibilities more effectively. This would lead to a more well-rounded education and a more fulfilling school experience.

Finally, a shorter break after every 2 weeks would allow students to spend more quality time with their families. While it is important for students to have a break from school, it is also important for them to maintain strong relationships with their families. By implementing a shorter break after every 2 weeks, students would be able to spend more quality time with their families without having to worry about falling behind in their studies.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,2

First of all, there are no such things as aliens, and if there were aliens they would have already done something to Earth and humans.

This Face of Mars was made natural.

As we already know Mother Nature can do things like this.

In fact, we see natural landforms everywhere.

The passage states,""Global Survey space craft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.""

Juat becuase you find something interesting on a different planet doesn't mean it was made by aliens.

The Man on the Moon for example it wasn't made by aliens, and nobody says it was, so then why should The Face on Mars be any different?

In one of the pitures in the passage it shows the ""famous Face"" and then you can see a hill next to the face.

It doesn't look like anything but a small hump, but its pretty much the same thing as the face, it's made of the same thing, but it doesn't have a face.

Now this why you should know that alliens did not creat the Face on Mars.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
F5CB9849B913,"Inactivity and lack of focus are common issues that can prevent a person from succeeding in their tasks. Identifying how individual unique styles can help can be an effective way to stay productive. For example, if you are a visual learner, create charts or diagrams to facilitate the task and allow yourself to better understand what needs to be done. If you are more of an auditory learner, try listening to music in the background as you work. Additionally, it might be helpful to take breaks to get up, walk around, and refocus. I have personally found that short breaks help to energize me and bring me back to a more productive state. 

If you find yourself in an inactive state, find ways that you can motivate yourself. This can be done through setting small achievable goals and rewarding yourself with something that you find pleasurable for completing them. This will help to shift your mindset and become more confident in your capabilities. Additionally, manage your time to ensure that you are utilizing it appropriately and making progress. Lastly, seek help and support if needed. Finding people who can help you stay on track and be accountable will be beneficial in keeping you driven and focused.

llama_70b_v1270,"As a high school student, I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. This is a very important topic because it affects the safety of not only the driver, but also passengers and other road users.

Firstly, using a cell phone while driving is a major distraction. When a driver is texting, calling, or browsing the internet, they are not fully focused on the road. This can lead to accidents, such as rear-ending another vehicle or veering off the road. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the United States in 2017. This is a staggering number and shows the severity of the issue.

Secondly, using a cell phone while driving impairs a driver's reaction time. When a driver is distracted by their phone, they may not be able to react quickly enough to unexpected events on the road. For example, if a pedestrian suddenly steps out into the road, a driver who is texting may not have enough time to brake or swerve to avoid hitting them. This could result in serious injury or even death.

Furthermore, using a cell phone while driving is illegal in many places. In the United States, for example, most states have laws that prohibit texting and driving. These laws have been put in place because lawmakers recognize the dangers of distracted driving. If a driver is caught using their cell phone while driving, they can face fines, license suspension, or even criminal charges.

Finally, there are many alternatives to using a cell phone while driving. For example, drivers can use hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth headsets, to make and receive calls. They can also use voice-to-text apps to send messages without having to physically handle their phone. Additionally, many cars now come equipped with built-in infotainment systems that allow drivers to control their phone's functions through voice commands or touch screens on the dashboard.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Using a cell phone while driving is a dangerous distraction that can lead to accidents and fatalities. It is illegal in many places and there are alternatives available that allow drivers to communicate safely while on the road. As a society, we need to take steps to ensure that our roads are safe for everyone, and prohibiting cell phone use while driving is an important step in achieving this goal.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

First and foremost I believe that we live in a community that is well kept and organized, and it should remain that way. The generations before us have given us a place filled with love and care , a place of neat parks and recreation centers, a place we can call home. This way of life should be kept up and exercised by our generation and the ones seceding us.

Community service gives everyone a chance to give back and help out, whether young or old.

I think that our community should be one of were children offer to help out; where the food banks are over filled with volunteers; where people don't hate jury duty; where people are true patriots; where people don't have to get sentenced just to pick up trash.

I wish that we could be a school with all of those traits.

So yes, I believe in community service being a requirement.

He was proud to break a record but he was alsovery mad because of him being 18 and still doing the trips on being a SegoingCowboy. He was also working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldnÂt say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. But luke thought of it that way and not by how many trips he was going to make or the number of places he was going to go. He knew that it was going to be a opportunity of a lifetime because you hardly ever get a opportunity of a lifetime when you are working to part time jobs and trying to raise moeny for your own self to live life. And when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldnÂt say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

He knew that it was going to be a opportunity of a lifetime because you hardly ever get a opportunity of a lifetime when you are working to part time jobs and trying to raise moeny for your own self to live life. Also when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat trip if luke would have said no then his friend Don Reist that invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat trip would have tought or asked why do you not want to go because because you wil get to go a lot of places that you would not be able to go also because you would get to havea full boat ride there and a emty boat ride back. Plus i will be there with you the whole time that you are there so you do not have to be scaryed if that is why you don't want to go. Also because you will be able to go and see part of the wolrd that you may never agin get the chance to go and see agin so we don't leave for anouther 2 days so that will give you a chance to think about the trip we are really hopeing you can make it but if you can't then we understand why because it is your chose so just please just think about it because it would mean alot to me and the other guys if you came. So he got Luke to say yes but he was only going to be there for a little bit because he has other things to do like get a house and also get a better job then the ones he already has so only for one year. But after that one year he had made it clear that he wanted to stay longer because he had stared to think that this was his job and after a while one of the boys came to him and asked him what would you think if you could stay here because our captian says that you got a job working with us if thats what you want to do is work with us but you do not have to if you don't then we have to take you back because we can't just let you stay like work for us. So Luke sid of couse i will work with you guys but we have to stop so i can get the rest of my stuff plusemy colth and i can just keep it in my bedroom right of couse you can. But no break able stuff is allowed on the ship oun less you don't have any where else to put it then we have a little bit of room were we can put it where it will be safe.

You may think that driverless cars are good but I think that driverless cars are senseless I wouldnt want that I would want to drive my car myself. I waited a long time to get my driving license and drive my own car but no they had to come up with the diverless car and make all the other cars seem useless. Im going to figure out what makes this car so good, and see if would come in handy because its alot of people are craveing this car.

This car seem so crazy because what if my car startes to act all crazy and catch on fire what am i going to do im waisted my money and time on that car and it would be hard to buy a new one . I think we should all this stick with the cars we are use to. Because when you get this car you wont know what to do, and most people dont read manual to cars they just say they figure it out on their own. Once they try that they end up messing something up and having to spend more money on getting it fixed.

The car may come in handy because they have senseors even though sensors are nothing new they help stop the car like when the person driving the car hits the brake the brake sensors each wheel to ruduce speed so the human can gain controll over his or her car again. It can help older people to like when they arent suppose to be driving. This car is like having a driving assistant. They dont wont need to drive the car would drive by its self that would be good for some old people that like to get out a lot.

Most drivers focus on keeping the riders saft but it this car is a smart car so if they had a accident the car can prevent it from happening. In some staes this car is not saft for people to drive so the car comapany must prove that the car is saft.

if some one gets injured in that car should it be the manufacturer fault or should it be the drivers fault i think that it should be the manufacturer fault because they built they car and i should feel saft I it.

Overall i dont that this car is smart to build because i wouldnt feel saft in it.

I think they should come up with another idea for a car because if a lot of people get hurt it that car they might end up bankrupt and sewd so bad that they would have to close down there shop and just start their retirement. This car seem very senseless and I wouldnt buy it.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

e1cf4688,"Should we keep the electoral college? No because when you vote for your candidate in the presidential election you are actually voting for hisher electors. Also because electors can be anyone not holdin up in the public office. Finally because voters cant always control their elected electoral college member will vote for the same candidate. Over 60 percent of todays voters would prefer a more direct way of electing our officials than how we are electing them now.

Did you know that when you vote for the candidate that you want to be elected into office you are not only voting for that candidate you are actually voting for that candidates electors? Under the electoral college system us voters dont vote for the president but we vote for a slate of electors which in turn elect the candidate we voted for. Say that you voted for Obama in last years election you didnt actually vote for Obama you voted for his electors to vote for im in turn of you voting for them. Many people see this to be fine but say that your candidates electors turned and voted for someone else thus leading you down a road of betrayl. This is one important reason for the electoral party to be disbanded.

Electors that represent a candidate in the presidential run can be anyone not holding public office. Who chooses for these electors? Not the voters of course but the state and sometimes the people who you are actually voting for the electors you havent even heard of or seen in any flyers or ads. That state chooses their officials from state conventions,and even sometimes at the state partys committee or the president has his own party of electors for himself which would in a way be cheating by having your own officials vote for you.

What if the electoral party you voted for to vote for a specific candidate and they went off and changed their mind mid election and passed that countries vote for a different xcandidate in the election? You cant always control the electors to stick with them voting for the elector you voted for but without the electoral college that group of voters who voted for a candidate would actually vote for the candidate that they actually want to win. Thus making the electoral college irrelevent because they dont need to form a party and change their vorte mid election.

We should not not keep the electoral college because of all the flawls in it and the deciving image it holds up. Because you do not vote for the candidate you vote for the electorial party member representing that candidate. That the candidate can be anyone chosen by the state and you cant always control that the member of the electoral college that you voted for to vot for a different candidate that the ended up voting for during the election.

EC0DB16948B2,"Venus is a rather intriguing planet that mankind would have a great interest in studying. Venus' great danger is what's stopping us from examining it up close. The author tries to say that overcoming this danger is worth dealing with to explore Venus, however. I believe their claim is valid and that there is value of trying to study the planet, even with these dangerous conditions. There's even a decent chance of working around the risks. The author uses reasons like it's the most Earth-like planet, studying Venus from a ship orbiting around the planet isn't insightful enough to learn much, and that NASA is even coming up with different methods of studying the planet to justify their idea.

There's a lot of evidence to suggest that Venus was originally similar to Earth in quite a few ways. The planet was likely covered with oceans that could've been able to support life. Venus also had other features like rocky sediment, craters, valleys, and mountains. Venus is also sometimes the closest planet to Earth, often swapping back and forth with Mars being the closest. This evidence shows that it's likely Venus was essentially an alternate version of Earth.

It's also a good point that hovering above the planet and observing it just isn't effective enough at gathering information. Since the atmosphere is impenetrable to light, photography and videography of the surface is near pointless. The inability to go down to the ground and collect samples of the materials, substances, and gases hinders our ability to understand the planet. Researchers are even considering innovating space technology to allow us to gather some form of meaningful knowledge. We need to advance past observing from an orbital space station and find a way to get down there.

NASA realizes that problems could be solved with the right approach. They've tested how long some electronics made of silicon carbide could survive in Venus' conditions and so far, the results have shown that there is potential. Building resistant computers may also collect information on the planet, but mechanical computers may get this job done the best. Mechanical computers were used in World War II, but they were sturdier than modern computers and don't require any electronics to function. If one method of getting closer to the planet doesn't work, we could always try again with another.

Overcoming the dangers of Venus is currently one of the toughest challenges of space exploration we've seen yet. With enough determination and patience though, we can find a way to work around this dilemma; especially since NASA clearly hasn't given up working on solutions. This may be necessary too; our current method of studying this place just isn't that good. The reward may be worth the effort too since Venus is one of the most interesting planets we've attempted exploring. Let's just hope that this won't stop us from wanting discover the whole universe.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

For example, let's say you are trying to decide which college to attend. If you only talk to one person, they might have a limited perspective based on their own experiences. However, if you talk to several people, you can get a variety of opinions and insights. You might talk to a college counselor who can give you information on the application process and financial aid, a current student who can tell you about their experiences on campus, and a graduate who can give you advice on career opportunities after graduation. By gathering all of this information, you can make a more informed decision about which college is the best fit for you.

In addition, seeking multiple opinions can help you avoid making a decision based on bias or limited information. If you only talk to one person, they might have their own biases or preferences that could influence their advice. However, by talking to multiple people, you can get a more well-rounded perspective and make a decision based on a variety of factors.

We take care of the animals being sent overseas while they are on the boats. Our jobs are to feed and water the animals, bring the food up from below deck, and clean the animal's stalls. I know this sounds like a boring job that's all work, but there are many reasons why this job is so fun.

The first reason is because while you are in the countries you are visiting, you get to go sightseeing. I saw things like the Panama Canal, the Acropolis, and an excavated castle. I also got to ride a gondola in Venice. You may be able to see such famous landmarks as the Eifle Tower, or the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Oh, and did I forget to mention that you get paid for that? If you have always wanted to travel, then this job just might be for you.

Another reason is because you get to slack off on the return trip. On the trip home, you have dropped off all the animals, so you no longer have a job to do. This means you have free time to do whatever you want. When I was on return trips, we would start up baseball games in the rooms where the animals used to be kept. Other times, someone would bring a deck of cards, and we would spend hours just playing poker. Once, we even had a table-tennis tournament.

This is certainly a fun and exciting job. On a more serious note, this job can make you more aware of other peoples problems. There are many troubled countries across the world.

EC3F3F26E635,"Pharmacists are healthcare professionals who work to ensure that patients receive the right medication at the right time. They are responsible for dispensing, administering, and monitoring medications to prevent adverse effects and ensure patient safety.

One of the primary job duties of a pharmacist is to dispense medications to patients. This involves reviewing prescriptions, verifying the patient's medical history, and ensuring that the medication being prescribed is appropriate for the patient's condition. Pharmacists also monitor the effects of medications on patients and provide counseling to help patients understand how to take their medications safely and effectively.

To become a pharmacist, one must first earn a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy (BSPh) degree. This typically involves four years of undergraduate study, including coursework in pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. After completing their BSPh degree, pharmacists must pass a national licensing exam to become registered pharmacists.

The salary range for pharmacists varies depending on factors such as location, experience, and specialization. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for pharmacists in the United States is $128,710. However, some pharmacists can earn salaries in excess of $200,000 per year.

The job outlook for pharmacists is positive. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment of pharmacists will grow by 3% from 2019 to 2029, which is faster than the average for all occupations. This growth is due in part to the aging population, which is more likely to require medication management.

darragh_claude_v7_686,"Limiting Car Usage for a Greener Future

As cities grow larger, traffic congestion and pollution have become serious issues affecting public health and the environment. While cars provide convenient transportation, overreliance on personal vehicles comes at significant costs. By limiting unnecessary car trips and promoting alternative modes of transit, communities can work towards a more sustainable future. 

There are several benefits to restricting car usage. Firstly, it can improve air quality and reduce health impacts. Emissions from automobile exhaust contain various pollutants like particulate matter and nitrogen oxides that are linked to respiratory illnesses. Cutting back on driving lowers the amounts of these harmful chemicals released into the atmosphere. With fewer vehicles on the road, neighborhoods experience less air pollution. This especially helps vulnerable groups such as children, elderly and those with existing lung or heart conditions.

In addition, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion on busy roads. Rush hour gridlock wastes people's time and fuels. It also increases vehicle emissions as cars burn more gas while idling or moving slowly. Some cities have seen travel times reduced by over 20% after implementing policies that discouraged commuting by private car. With less congestion, public transit is able to move more efficiently as well. This makes alternative transportation options more reliable and attractive. 

Encouraging alternative modes of transit brings further benefits. Walking and cycling improve public health by encouraging an active lifestyle. Biking or walking even short distances on a regular basis can significantly boost physical fitness. These low-carbon options also don't contribute to noise or air pollution at congested urban areas. Public transportation is another greener alternative to personal vehicles as multiple people can share the same bus or train trip. A robust transit network with good connectivity and frequency of service helps reduce dependence on automobiles.

In conclusion, limiting unnecessary car trips would lead to tangible environmental and public health advantages. By prioritizing efficient modes of travel over personal vehicles, communities can enjoy cleaner air, less traffic and a more sustainable long-term future. Stronger policies are needed to change individual transportation habits and support viable alternatives to driving. A multi-pronged approach considering all mobility options can help balance transportation needs with environmental protection goals.",1,darragh_claude_v7,Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage.

AB7659F38584,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author believes that studying the planet Venus would be a rewarding endeavor. The author presents his claim and supports it very well through the knowledge he already has about the planet, the knowledge that the exploration of Venus might uncover, and persuasion through relating to his readers. This allows for the author to very clearly and precisely get his point across to those who might read the article. It also creates a strong way for the author to connect to his readers.

When the author uses the knowledge that he already has about Venus, he is trying to convey that what information we have on Venus is already important. In Paragraph 4, the author presents the idea that Venus ""may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". When the author introduces this concept, he also describes the surface of Venus to be ""rocky"" and ""includes similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,"". Becuase the author presents the idea that Venus might have been like Earth and then goes on to describe this, he strongly supports his claim of how rewarding studying Venus could be. He is also trying to spark an interest in his readers regarding the study of Venus.

In Paragraph 6, the author suggests that researchers need to get closer to the ground.

When he says ""researchers cannot take samples...from a distance"", he is urging scientists to find ways to get closer to Venus's surface. To support this he also presents that scientists ""cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else"" without getting closer. He uses the curiousity of man to lure them into what he wants them to. This proves to be strong support for his main claim. This also leads right into the persuasion aspect of his support.

The author uses persuasion throughout the article, but in Paragraph 8 it is used excessively. Near the end of the paragraph, he introduces the idea that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."". When he uses ""should not"" in that sentence, he is adding a strong opinion to his conclusion. In doing so, his opinion also contributes to the persuasion factor. This allows for him to call out to the reader individually and emotionally affect them. Using persuasion made way for the author to support his claim very well and influence the reader to think the same way as him.

Overall, the author has a very well thought-out way of supporting his claim that studying Venus would be a worthy persuit, despite the dangers. The author hits the brick wall head on by first presenting the knowledge he already has. This allows for the readers to have a little bit of foreground to play on.

08DB3C4C4C3D,"Driverless cars would be a great thing for the future but there are also negatives to it. It would also be a lot of money spent to make this invention possible. If you think about it cars are pretty much driverless in a way because some cars can parallel park on their own, and evenstop themselves when it senses an oncoming vehicle that is to close.

The negative effect that this would have on the world is that these cars could possibly malfunction and lead to a wreck. It would let a drivers guard down to a very low level and they wouldn't be focused on the road as much as they would if they were the ones actually driving. This could also take away the law that drivers have to have a liscense in order to drive because some will think ""who needs a liscense to drive a driverless vehicle""?. That issue alone could lead to many problems. I believe that vehicles are only safe when a human is controlling it.

The positive effect that driverless cars could have on the world is that it could create many jobs for people. It could help people get places that they aren't familiar with.

My opinion on this is that vehicles should only be driven by a human that is liscensed to operate a vehicle. I don't think people will be safe if driverless cars became a thing because the creators wouldn't be 100% sure that these vehicles are safe to be on the road. Lives could possibly be at risk.

9DEE651A7219,"Our principle has decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity. Students can serve as student council, work on the yearbook, or even play a sport. I think this is a good idea or way for kids to express themselves. Here are some reasons why I agree with being apart of the activities.

One thing you can do is work on the yearbook. You can also open up and help motivate others. Participating in something helps with many skills such as, communication and working with others. The yearbook could even have anonymous writers, if you want to say something and don't want everyone knowing who said it. Also taking photos of other activities around the school would even be great.

Another extracurricular activity you could do is serving as student council. If you want to see changes in somethings you can step up and work as a council to make a difference. You could also get groups to hang up motivational quotes around the school. Sometimes, even having funds to raise money for the school would be a helpful idea.

You can also play sports to participate in an activity. Playing sports gives you the time for you make new friends, do what you love, and even hang with your bestie. Finding a sport you like can be hard but giving it your all is the best you can do. You can even get scholarships to colleges. And being on a team is your best suport group, they are always there when you need them.

In conclusion, I agree we should be in extracurricular activities. It gives us the opportunity to express our self and have fun doing it. They can also help try and change things to make a difference. The activities also have benefits for us and for school. All of these are reasons why we should participate in extracurricular activities.   Â  Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
1ED627A6FC40,"Technology is proving fast. People have many different new ways to get education. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes by way of online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they will get distract, have questions that can not be solve, and learn nothing without internet.

Student will get distract from learning at home. Some student have self control to learn, but most don't. They may doing another thing while learning, or fall in to a sleep. Student can play video game and the teacher will not notice. For example, kids are the fast learner on computers. My brother who is in second grade, he's English class is taking online. During the lesson, he open up another window to play game. He divide the screen into two small screen, so one side is English class and the another one is the game that he like to play, and teacher do not notice that. Technology is a simple way to get education, but also is the way how students can ""cheat"".

Student may have question during the online class that can't get solve. Not anything online can give you an answer. My geometry teacher was absent on one day, and she made a video of the lesson we missed. During the video, I have a lot question, I tried to find them online, but I find nothing. I couldn't solve the question until I see her again. There is a lot simpler to learn in class because teacher will give you example to help you understand the question and give some practice of it, this way you can really learn and understand the lesson. Online class is just give you a lesson, when you have a question, you have no one to ask and no where to get help.

Online class will not work without internet. Some places have problem on internet, if that happen, student will not learn anything. My friend Generic_Name, who live in a town, has very bad internet at home, sometime the internet is completely dead. She have to take the classes online, but without internet, she couldn't do anything. That day she was so angry because she learned nothing, and she don't have a second option to get education. Therefore, online class is not benefit to everybody.

Some may say students would benefit from attend classes from home because they will get enough rest; however, they would not learn anything.

There is one problem though, does this give the people the idea of I can just sit back relax and not pay attention. The car will do everything for me. NO! You still have to know how to function the car and watch out for other cars.

Like what the article said sensors are nothing new and have been around since the 1980's. The technolgy has always been there for example movie players, cameras, GPS. The car companies have probably thought of the idea of hands free driving for a long time. No company had the nerves to do it because they were afraid of some not paying attention and lets say the driveless system stops working and your on your phone and get in a bad car crash. The company would then get sued. The technology has gotten so good these days they are ready to start making these next generation cars. They did put in that the car will watch out for you and go the right speed and take you where you want to but you wil still have to do some little things. The article states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify teh driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" After reading that I would feel pretty confident about getting behind a wheel and letting the car drive for me. I have to admitt that would be pretty cool. I would like to see more people start using them. For istince I have never see one of these cars and I would give it some time for other people to use them just to make sure they are totally safe and I could put my family in one.

The car industry definantly has a bright future ahead of them with all these newer envented cars coming out. Especially this year Tesla is the guinne piq of them all so if things don't go right the other companies can correct the mistake on their own car. It would be cool to drive one in a town or city but I don't know how it would to being on a highway with some driveless people and some actual drivers. It would be hard because if you hit someone in a driverless car is it your fault or do you get mad at the car companie. I think things could really turn into a mess.

falcon_180b_v1_234,"Dear Principal,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you today to share my thoughts on the new cell phone policy being considered for our school. After careful consideration, I believe that Policy 1 is the better option for our school.

Firstly, allowing students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times will give us the opportunity to stay connected with our families and friends. In case of an emergency, it is important that we are able to reach out to our loved ones quickly and easily. Additionally, having access to our phones during break times will allow us to listen to music or play games, which can help us relax and recharge before returning to class.

Secondly, having our phones with us throughout the day will encourage responsibility and trustworthiness. If we are allowed to have our phones with us, we will need to learn how to manage our time effectively and resist the temptation to use them during class time. This will help us develop important life skills that will serve us well in the future.

Lastly, banning phones altogether may cause more problems than it solves. If students are not allowed to have their phones with them, they may be more likely to sneak them into school or use them secretly during class time. This could result in more distractions and disruptions in the classroom, which would not be beneficial for anyone.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 is the better option for our school. Allowing students to bring their phones to school and use them during break times will provide us with important benefits, while also encouraging responsibility and trustworthiness. Thank you for considering my thoughts on this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. She is considering two possible policies:

EDFFA0E4D88C," In recent years, there has been a growing debate about whether school weeks should consist of four days with ten-hour school days or five days with eight-hour school days. While some people believe that longer school days would be beneficial, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, there is no point in doing that, as it would lead to a number of negative consequences.

First and foremost, if students have more school days, they will likely miss more hours at work. This is especially true for students who work part-time or full-time jobs after school. If they have to attend school for longer hours, they will not have as much time to work and earn money, which can be a significant challenge for some students, especially those who need to pay bills or save for college.

Second, if students have more school days, they will likely use that extra day to not study and do nothing. This is because many students are already struggling to keep up with their workload, and an extra day off would just give them more time to procrastinate and fall behind. Moreover, if students are not studying, they will not be prepared for exams and projects, which can lead to lower grades and a lack of motivation.

Third, if students have more school days, they will likely use their electronic devices more at home. While some people believe that this will save energy and money, it is not the case. Students will still use their electronic devices at home, whether it is for gaming, watching TV, or scrolling through social media. In fact, if they have more school days, they will have more time to use their electronic devices, which can lead to a decrease in productivity and a lack of focus.

Finally, if students have more school days, teachers and staff members will likely think that students are going home and doing their homework or studying. However, this is not always the case. Some students need help with school work, or they feel more comfortable studying at school. With fewer school days, teachers and staff members can provide more individualized support and resources to help students succeed.

In conclusion, while the idea of having longer school days may seem like a good way to save time and money, it is not the best solution. Instead, I believe that students should continue to attend school for the regular five days, with eight-hour school days. This will allow students to maintain a good work-",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

First of all, libraries are still the best place to go to find REAL books. I mean, have you ever tried to read a whole book on a computer screen? It's just not the same as holding a real book in your hands. And what about all the books that haven't been digitized yet? We can't just forget about those!

Plus, libraries are way more than just a place to find books. They're community centers, where people can come together and learn from each other. You can go to a library and find people who are experts in all sorts of things, from science to art to history. And they're always happy to share their knowledge with you.

Another thing, libraries are super important for kids. They're a place where kids can go to get help with their homework, or just to find fun things to read. And a lot of libraries have programs and activities for kids, like storytime or book clubs. These are things that kids can't get from just looking at a screen.

But maybe the most important thing about libraries is that they're a place where everyone can go, no matter who they are or how much money they have. You don't have to have a computer or internet access to use a library. And a lot of libraries have programs that help people who are struggling, like job training or English as a second language classes.

So, in conclusion, libraries are still super important in the digital age. They're not just a place to find books, they're community centers where people can come together and learn from each other.

0B0C03A04CDF,"The planet, Venus, has the potential for being a great place to visit and for sending people there, too. While it has some dangerous conditions, scientists have come up with a solution to oversee the planets atmosphere. According to NASA, ""the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" This information shows that it is possible for people to, not live on Venus, but live above it without being harmed.

Astronomers have been studying Venus for a long time and they believe that the planet once had life on it. It makes even more sense for this to be true as Venus is one of the closest planets to the Earth. According to the author, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Not only that, but it has a large rocky surface with hills, mountains, and valleys. With all of the advanced technology we have in todays world, scientists can also find several ways to reduce the pressure and harsh conditions. This makes it even more safe to study further into the planet itself.

There are many ways we could think of to make sure that Venus is a safe and reliable planet, but many people still wonder of this amazing idea. If NASA can send people to the moon and send a machine on Mars, than who says we can't do the same with this gas planet? This discovery could be a great change to the world. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

'' I think that it would be a great idea. ,I stated We could go on the ships to see different countries on our free time and we could have fun watching the animals.''

Many resonsons why I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program are you can help out people and you can visit cool places while you are traveling. Also you could get a chance to learn how it feels to help someone out that really needs it like Luke did.

Luke also got the opportunities to see China and Europe, the Acropolis in Greece, take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, and he toured a excavated castle in Crete and he saw the Panama Canal on his way to China, like you could if you did something like this.

Also if you did this you would have the opportunity to see and travel the different oceans like Luke did in his travels.

My conclusion is if you join the Seagoing Cowboy program you will enjoy the sights you see and the wonderful feeling of helping out people ineed in other countries.

I think this because in the article it says ''Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' he says ''It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.'' And that

Awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange vistiors for many years. That is why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program.            ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
E0553AEE109E,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the topic ""Why the length of summer break should not be reduced"" as an 8th grade student:

Summer break is one of the most anticipated times of the year for students. It's a time to relax, have fun, and recharge for the next school year. However, some people think that the three-month summer break is too long and that it negatively impacts students' academic performance. While I understand their concerns, I strongly believe that the length of summer break should not be reduced.

Firstly, summer break is crucial for students' mental health. The academic year can be incredibly stressful, with long hours of school, homework, and exams. Reducing the summer break would mean adding more stress to students' lives, which could lead to burnout and decreased motivation. Students need time to unwind and recharge during the summer break, which helps them come back to school refreshed and ready to learn.

Secondly, summer break provides students with opportunities to explore their interests and passions outside of school. Many students use the summer break to participate in sports, music, or art camps, or to volunteer in their communities. These experiences help students develop their skills and interests, which can benefit them in the long run. Reducing the summer break would mean taking away these opportunities for students to explore and grow.

Thirdly, summer break allows students to spend quality time with their families and friends. The summer break is a time for families to travel, go on vacations, or simply spend time together. Reducing the summer break would mean taking away this precious time with loved ones, which can have a negative impact on students' emotional well-being.

Finally, reducing the summer break would not necessarily improve academic performance. While some people argue that a shorter summer break would allow students to focus more on their studies, I believe that this is not the case. Students need time to relax and recharge during the summer break to perform their best in school. Additionally, reducing the summer break would mean packing more schoolwork into a shorter period of time, which could lead to increased stress and decreased motivation.

The man continues to argue with me and say that aliens are real and this alien artifact looks like a human face. I have to keep telling him that this is just a natural landform which is called a butte or mesa. This certain mesa looks like a face only because it shows most of the characteristics that a human has such as; the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth which are all just formed by shadows. The man asked how does NASA know that this rock formation that you ""supposedly"" think, is a mesa? He just thinks that it's a sign of aliens. I tell him that Nasa was able to figure it out because a mesa is a a big rock formation that just has a flat top and thats what the face looked like if you see it up close.

The author supports his claim by stating that the reasoning for continuing research on how to get to Venus's surface is, because it was once very similar to earth's surface long ago.

Astronomers claim that Venus probably had oceans and supported many different life forms just like Earth. The author states that the value of returning to Venus seems idisputable due to the fact that it is sometimes our nearest option. Since it is our nearest option and giving consideration to how long time frames of space travel are, this is a pretty good claim. So far the author's claims are, that it is our nearest option and it was once very much like Earth and habitable.

The only problem now is Venus's surface conditons. On Venus's surface the temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than it is on Earth. However the author goes on to state that NASA has a possible solution to the conditions on Venus's surface. NASA's possible soolution would be to have a blimp like vehicle hover 30 miles above Venus's surface. Even though the temperature would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit it is still survivable for humans.

The author states that instead of looking at the problems as risks we should look at them as challenges.

The author claims that striviing to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead us to many more equally intimidating endeavors. Also that our travels beyond Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. So the authors claims for furthering research on how to get to Venus are, it's the nearest planet to us, it used to be very hospitable and much like Earth, and that we should see the risks as challenges and find ways to get past them. The author supported these claims very well.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
9F7E189A2DCF,"It is often said that first impressions are everything, and they can have a powerful influence on how we view another person. But is it always the case that first impressions are accurate? The truth is, first impressions can change after we get to know a person. This has been supported both by personal experiences and factual evidence.

On a personal level, I have found that sometimes my first impressions of someone have proven to be inaccurate after getting to know them better. A few years ago, I met someone who immediately rubbed me the wrong way. On the surface, they seemed cocky and rude. But as I got to know them better, this person eventually became one of my closest friends. It turns out, they were actually quite humble and kind, and I was glad that I decided to give them a chance despite my first impressions.

This idea has also been supported by academic research. In a 2012 study, researchers asked participants to watch brief videos of strangers and form an impression. The study found that the more information participants had about the persons in the video, the more their first impression changed. These findings suggest that the more interaction we have with someone, the more our initial impression of them may change.

Overall, it appears that first impressions are not always an accurate indicator of someone's personality or character. This is why it is important to look beyond the surface of any person and get to know them better. All too often, a knee-jerk reaction to a first impression can lead to judgments that are not entirely valid and might be better described as an educated guess.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Write an essay discussing the idea that first impressions can change after getting to know someone.

2875CE3A8253,"The Electoral College vote is a somewhat a confusing process with the voter not voting for the president, but electors who elect the president. Many people think that this method is flawed becuase the people are not electing the president. On the hand people think that the Electoral vote keeps the race for presidency with a more clear outcome, than if they were elected by the popular vote. There are defiently two different arguments to this points with both sides involving good evidence.

There are many flaws that people bring up in regard to the electoral vote. One of these is that since the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, the electors could easily defy the will of the people. The most obvious fact about the electoral vote is that you are not voting for the president, but for a group of electors who then vote for the president. This is also unfair to voters because the candidates don't spend time in states they know will not win. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not even see the candidates, and people in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. In turn the elctoral college is unfair and outdated.

Though there are plently of things wrong with the electoral college there are still plently of good arguments as to why we should keep it.Â  With the electoral college vote there is less of a chance of a dispute over the outcome thaan with the popular vote, though it happened in the 2000 election. The electoral can also make the race more fair, because a candidate with more regional appeal can not gain more electoral votes by campaigning heavily in that area. The electoral college also can help avoid run-off elections like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992. Overally the Electoral College vote is a way of electing a president without actually electing a president, that should probabley be removed so the people have more of a say on who runs there country.

32FB7B616690,"My Opinion on Electoral Vote, is that we should have a direct vote with all americans to be able to pick not just other people that are with goverment it is not fair, we vote.. yes? but we don't get anyhting out of it. They say we can vote but that vote never counts, only Electoral Votes do. We are like basically thorwing a vote to nothing.

We should have us Amercians to be able to vote. Not just politicans, it should be the land of the free, not something that is keeping us from changing or helping are country that we think it's right. Well not I like it should be are turn. Over 60 Percent of us Amercians want change in this and I think we should have it, you must be 21 years old or older and it should just be U.S.Citizens only, you have to be born and rasied here.

Popular votes don't even matter now because to be honest there not even counting them. So really what is the point here? Direct vote for U.S. Citizens or have the Goverment choice for you in a way they choose there Politicans. The most votes should be able to have a a goat voting and so on. The Electoral colledge has plenty of problems like, People in there get the wrong Electoral votes mixed up which is a big issue and needs to be fixed right away.

The majority of the Electoral votes are 270 there are 538 electors its required to elect a President each state has an enrollement of which each state can have or obtain pretty much if the state is bigger the Electoral votes proceed to be higher and higher, which isn't excalty fair we wanna go with our own votes etc. We deserve to makeour lifes easier not the goverments or anything like that we are equal and it should stay that way.

The president election is held every 4 years and a big deal and which is a problem is, voters cannot vote for who they want vote for, but the state electors, can make the president and give him this so called power, anyways that's a state issue, change should be here soon but, thats a little of my input on here for which Electoral votes or Directs are right, change will be soon so just keep your hopes up and keep your head up straight.

C5E45F477A84,"Have you ever met someone, or an interviewer, and show a good or bad impression to them? People think that first impression can be changed because everybody has a second chance. While others think that first impression can not be changed because it shows who you are. I agree to the motion that first impression are impossible to change because it shows your personality, your attitude and who you are.

Firstly, first impressions are impossible to change because it shows your personality. I had a friend, who dressed inappopriartely to an interview for her job. But to her surprise she did not get the job because of how she dressed. Also after a while, she couldn't get any job elsewhere. This means that whenever you go somewhere, you should dress appropriately, check how you use your tone with others, so people will know that you are a good person, respectful, can take responsibiliy for your actions and shows how mature you are. Not only does first impressions show your personality, however, it shows your attitude.

Additionally, showing your attitude is most likely impossible to change. I remember I used to disrespect, fight and insult others when they did something to me I didn't like or even if they needed help from me. I met this old lady and she asked for my help then I told her that I didn't want to and insulted her, then she said to me I am going to have a hard time in life but i didn't take what sh said seriouly and left. As a result of what happened, as I grew up, I tried to change but couldn't because when something goes bad and I knew it was not me, they will all mention my name. And I wish there was someone there to offend me. And thats when I remembered what the old lady told me, I wanted to go ask for forgiveness but unlucky for me she went to heaven and now am left with her curse. Which gives me this conclusion that always respect everyone you see even if you don't know them.

First impressions also shows the kind of person you really are.

Furthermore, your impressions shows who you are. Not long ago, this was this lady on the news. When i heard the news it shocked me because she went to a store, picked an ice cream from the fridge, licked it, and put it back in the fridge without paying for it. This obviously shows that, she ruined her reputation in public and everywhere. Now everyone knows who she really is. Not only did it ruined reputation but she brought a shame to herself, her family, and also her native country. First impressions are impossible to change.

Lastly, it is valid that first impressions can be changed because everyone has a second chance. But not really because sometimes your impressions towards someone stays the same even if you change. Others will think you are not your self today and also others will think it's a good thing but not everyone depending on what impression you made on your first time meeting. So I say that first impressions likely impossible to change.

In a Nutshell, showing your character, who you are, and your behaviour are impossible to change on your first impression. Mostly first impressions are not easy to change. Would you on your first impression be respectful or disrespectful, appopriate or inoppopriate, and be willing to take responsiblity of the concequences of you on seeing someone older than you, are you?",0,original_moth,"Task:

4405E8E5129D,"All around the world car use is declining and we are witnessing different approaches that reduce pollution and reliance on cars. In Vauban, Germany, an experimental suburb does not allow any cars and is compact so that transportation can be by foot or bike. In Paris, a number of days banned the use of cars for a large part of the population due to the amount of pollution and smog. In Bogota Columbia, one day a year is reserved as car-free day in which all cars are prohibited. Many other cities are joining in this ""Holiday"". Obviously the over-use of cars in todays society and the pollution it causes in large cities is a problem. These societies are taking steps toward making the areas better places to live.

The car-free community experiment of Vauban Germany was completed in 2006 and is home to 5,500 people. Many of the residents in the community including Heidrun Walter feel ""...much happier this way"". In my opinion a car-free community in which I can walk to any friends house or store sounds exciting and enjoyable. Also, the amount of pollution it would decrease would be outstanding. Many communities are noticing this trend and are interested in how it is catching on.

In Paris, France a ban of cars with certain license plates was enforced to clear the air of the city. The ban was enforced after near-record breaking pollution. The smog created an unhealthy atmosphere full of congestion. After nearly a week, the smog cleared enough that the ban was rescinded.

A car-free day is taking hold in Colombia, started by Bogota, in which one day a year all car-use is prohibited. The citizens are often excited to participate and for the last three years the turnout has grown. This participation helps the pollution in the society and influences other communities to do the same. All of these societies are taking different approaches to reducing car-use but they are all working. Hopefully limiting car usage will continue to grow throughout the world.

58453EDC66BA,"Many people don't take after schoolÂ activities and some do that is just the type of person and they desicion of that person or their parents. I don't take an after schoolÂ activity because I feel like it would stress me out, and when I get stressed out I get angry extremely fast. My parents don't make me do because they think it is for the best to let me choose that desicion but some parents do make them because they feel it's for the best. So I disagree with this statement because some students may have busy aÂ life, some may be having family issues happening at the certain moment, and others may not be interested in a certain activity.

One thing is some kids may have busy lives and they can't make the time for it. An example is if a kid has a after schoolÂ job and they have to work on certain days. It means they would either need to get special permission from the school or would they have to take kids away from their job. Another example is if the kid has a lot of homework and they have a certain amount of time. They would have to stay up all night in order to finish the homework because of an after schoolÂ activity.

Some of the students may be going through some family issues at that current moment. What about if a student's parents are going through a divorce. That student could have continuous panic attacks or having mood swings the would probably get in them trouble. Also what if one of the student's relatives are sick or got into an accident. The relative would probably want the student there a lot because it could be getting worse or they could be close to death, the student wouldn't have time to see them.

My last example is if the student is not interested in a certain extracurricular. They student may get signed up for a sport he doesn't like but is required to take. He probably wouldn't try his best because he doesn't find the sport interesting or just doesn't really care. Also if the student attempted to sign up for something but doesn't make it, so they sign him up something he doesn't like. If a student would attempted to sign up for track but doesn't make it he might get signed up for volleyball but he doesn't enjoy volleyball.

So in conclusion I don't think it is fair to force students and their peers to do after school activities and it should be students or his parents choice. If a kid doesn't want to take a extracurricular it is their right not to and if they do, they choose an extracurricular. I believe it is the students choice to choose, or the parents of that certain student and not the school. So I disagree with it because some students could have a busy life like having a job, they could have family issues like a divorce, and theirs may not be interested in a certain activity like football or baseball.

I have begun to notice some of my friends are beginning to do community service. I've also know that you are thinking that its not such a bad idea for every student to perform some sort of community help. I do agree and disagree with this but there may be some issues to having every student some community work .

I personally believe that no student should be forced to have to do community service but can if they please. I say this knowing that some kids have other activities that take place through out their days which may intervene with there community service jobs. For athletes or people that have something after school or before school daily and has no spare time to work in the community. I also think that its unfair to make someone do something they don't feel they should have to do because if they wanted to do it they would have signed up for on their own rather then to be told they must do it.

I also think that its a good idea because it gives us a chance to help our community. It also gives us a chance to get away from the usual and try to make a change throughout our neighborhoods or anything in our environment. Also we will be doing our parts by getting an education and helping others for our community. I also think it would make us look like a better as a community, school, and district because we are helping out everyone and working together.

This decision is for you to decide whether or not we as students will have to or wont have to do community service. We as a community need to do our parts and so do you and if that's what it takes then we need to work together. I know that some may agree and others may not but I believe both ways and so do others.

CA4E67209D3C,"Why is it important to ask multiple people for advice than just to ask one person. If you ask one person for advice you will probably get the same answer every time. Also you would be able to see how some of the ideas that are wrong. So asking advice from multiple people can help you get a different point of viewÂ on things, so you could try new ideas, and so you could see the bad idea.

One reason why seeking help from multiple people is because it would let you see things in different perspectives or point of views. One point of view could be like you should sell drugs. The other point of viewÂ is that you should not sell drugs. Then you start asking more people and more people are saying that you should not sell drugs.

Another reason why seeking advice from multiple people is that you could try a new idea. so lets say someone says ""you should go rock wall climbing"". Then another person says ""you should go swim with sharks"". You start asking and you go swim with sharks and then you climbed a rock wall.

Finally, why you should look for advice from multiple people is because it will show you all the negative ideas. One of those ideas could be to go break into a bank. Now this could be your best friend saying this. then you start asking around and people are saying that this is a bad idea. Right then and there the guy realized maybeÂ my friend is not who he is.

All in all these few paragraphs show that looking for advice is a good thing. one reason is that it will show you all the different point of views from people. Another reason is that it will show you new ideas. Finally it will show you the bad ideas. All these show that asking multiple people for advice is a good thing.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
2823F7B47127,"Have you ever wondered if doing class work from home benefits the students? Yes, students would be able to benefit from doing class work from home. I have some strong and good reasonsÂ on why it benefits them. These reasons have been said by many people in the past that have done it as they listed; they are more focused, more time with family, more sleep, and you can do it at any point of the day.

First, more students say they feel more focused at home then what they would've been in school. For example, they say that there is no distraction to keep them from completeing their work and turning it in. Especaily, when its something important that would help them graduate from their classes. In fact, they have better thoughts of what they are going to do for their classÂ work. Even though, when they have importantÂ family that they don't get to see as offten they would be able to spend more time with them.

As a result, students that do their class work from home have had a greater portion of passing then beingÂ inÂ school. Thus, students have been able to work better when they have gotten a full night or resting. In other words, students have proven to be more active and awake when they wake up at there own time. Lastly, students don't worry about having to rush through the material and turning it in on time.

In conclusion, do students really benfit attending school from home? Students do benefit more when they are attending school from home. More importantly, they can focus more on the work given, as well have more time with theirÂ family, they can get plenty of sleep to do be able to do their work, and they can do their work when they feel theyÂ are ready to complete it in the day.Â  Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
F7561C027920,"In high school, summer projects (especially for advanced placement classes) are assignments that students must complete. There is no way to get out from completing those assignments. Teachers create most of these summer projects because they know exactly what the students should learn before they reach the first class of the year. For example, AP Language and Composition has the students create 15 precis on different nonfiction pieces and read the book

Thank You for Arguing in order to prepare for some of the essays that will be written for the exam. Although many people believe that teachers should create these summer projects because the students would know exactly what they need to learn or prepare for, nevertheless, students should be the ones creating the summer projects because it gives them a chance to show their creativity, use their skills from prior knowledge, and build on life skills needed for the future.

Giving the students the ability to use their creativity is very important because it lets their voices and thoughts be heard. Students usually have more time over the summer to be able to express their creativity, but that is being pulled back due to the same projects that teachers have them do every year. For example, most high school math classes provide students with a four to six page study guide to complete over the summer to make sure that their prior knowledge is still remembered. What if students created their own, unique study guides to complete? How about a presentation on the basics of a unit and sharing it with the class the first or second day back? Not only would the students be able to use their creativity in a project and express their knowledge in many different ways, students in the first class would have a great review of prior knowledge to prepare them for the challenge ahead. Giving students an assignment that they create also makes them more interested and determined to complete their project. Most students would rather show what they learned their own way than the same way as everyone else, and a lot of teacher-designed assignments have the students all doing the same thing. It might be easier for the teacher to grade or review, but students aren't enjoying the assignment because they aren't able to express their knowledge that is different from everyone else. Letting the students create their own projects will give them the opportunity to be creative and express their ideas. Additionally, students will continue to use or remember the skills and knowledge prior to help them create their projects.

The biggest reason why these summer projects are created is so that students wouldn't lose the skills and knowledge from previous years that are need for their upcoming classes. If the students created their own summer projects, they would not lose those skills or knowledge at all. More than likely, they would research more about certain skills or information in order to make their projects even better and stand out from their peers. Subjects such as science and english are definitely able to make this happen because the skills and techniques that are learned can always be worked on, and they are easier for students to share what they know about certain topics. For example, AP chemistry has everyone doing the same assignment before the school year starts. Students in AP Chemistry, instead, could create their own experiments with the skills and knowledge acquired from Research Chemistry. The students would not only keep the techniques/skills practiced and knowledge from the year before, but also have the opportunity to explore different skills or use the skills obtained at a more advanced level. Even though students wouldn't lose the skills and knowledge learned from previous classes, they would also learn and build on some others skills such as life skills.

Student-designed projects would build on skills that students need for the future. Teachers help them practice life skills with these projects as they could be long and tedious. However, students should have opportunities to build these skills themselves to prepare them for the upcoming school year and their future in general. Students who would work really hard on their own summer projects build their organizational skills as they plan out their assignments. Time management is another skill that is taken into these projects. Practicing time management prepares them for college and their future careers as deadlines can't be rearranged, and some tasks take more time than others. They would be able to schedule how much time in a day they can work on their summer assignments. Students who create their own projects also practice focusing and perseverance. There will be times where the project comes to a stand still in progress; practicing focus and perseverance encourages students to not give up on their projects and to make it the best it can be. In conclusion, students will prepare themselves for future tasks such as college projects and career projects when they create their own summer projects in high school.

So, what is the point on arguing about whether students or teachers should create the summer projects? These projects set up the students for what is coming in the following school year. The knowledge and skills used in previous classes are still needed for the upcoming classes. However, when students are able to be creative and make their own projects, those skills and knowledge would never leave them. In fact, teachers would be amazed at how advanced the skills of their students are because the students were actually interested in learning more to create an amazing summer project.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

darragh_claude_v7_537,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the current Electoral College system to selecting the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed with the aim of giving smaller states more influence, I believe the popular vote would better achieve the democratic principle of one person, one vote.

One argument made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build wider geographical coalitions and causes them to campaign across many states. However, research shows that in recent elections, candidates focus their efforts on only a handful of swing states that could vote either way. This means that many states are ignored, and voters in the vast majority of states feel their votes do not really count. Switching to the popular vote would motivate candidates to actively campaign nationwide and encourage higher voter turnout across all 50 states. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, presidential candidates might only focus on campaigning in populous cities. However, advanced technology like television, radio and internet now allow candidates to easily reach both urban and rural voters across the country. Votes from smaller states or rural areas would not be overlooked - every vote would be counted equally under the popular vote system. 

A key counterargument is that the Electoral College system preserves the federal character of our system and protects the interests of small states. However, recent elections have shown that the winner of the national popular vote did not always win in the Electoral College. This undermines the principle of one person, one vote. While smaller states deserve a voice, giving some citizensâ votes more weight than others merely based on their location is inconsistent with democratic values. The popular vote would ensure that every vote carries the same weight in determining the outcome.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College may have had benefits in the past, changing demographics and technology have reduced the need for the current system. Switching to a national popular vote would strengthen our democracy by motivating candidates to address all Americans and respecting the core democratic principle of one person, one vote.

CD9AF89E5CA1," In recent years, there has been a growing trend among high school students to graduate early, with some students believing that this is the key to a successful future. While graduating early can bring many benefits, such as increased opportunities and knowledge, it is not always the best choice for every student.

Firstly, graduating early can open up a wealth of opportunities for students. For example, my brother graduated from high school in three years and was offered a full scholarship to attend Harvard University. This was a huge accomplishment for him and has set him up for a bright future. Similarly, many students who graduate early are able to start their careers at a younger age, which can lead to more opportunities for advancement and higher salaries.

Secondly, graduating early can give students a better understanding of the college experience. While it can be intimidating for some students to attend college, those who graduate early are able to gain a better sense of what to expect. This can help them to be more prepared and confident when they arrive on campus. Additionally, many students who graduate early are able to take advantage of the resources and support available at their university, which can help them to succeed academically and professionally.

Finally, graduating early can be a valuable experience for students. While it may be challenging to complete high school in three years, the skills and discipline required to do so can be invaluable in other areas of life. Additionally, graduating early can be a great way to set oneself apart from other students and to demonstrate a level of maturity and responsibility.

In conclusion, graduating early from high school can bring many benefits, such as increased opportunities and knowledge. However, it is not always the best choice for every student.

The development of driverless cars would be an amazing thing.

So many bad situations could be avoided with driverless cars because the human drving a car is an enormous variable.

The payoff of using driverless cars would be giant as well.

Granted, it would be expensive and the period of time it would take to completely phase out regular cars would be lengthy, it would be a worthwhile investment into the future.

The development of driverless cars would be an amazing in incredibly helpful step for society and the car manufacturing world.

Every year hundreds of thousands of people are killed in car accidents.

Many of those accidents are a result of neglegence on the fault of the driver.

Driving while under the influence, driving and texting, driving and making calls, driving and eating, driving and putting make-up on; all are things that cause car accidents that could be avoided with driverless cars. With driverless cars, passengers would be able to go on the road and not have to deal with the stress that comes with driving around on busy roads, or the stress that comes with taking into consideration bad drivers, other people driving under the influence, or just other drivers in general.

Driverless cars would eliminate the biggest variable regarding cars: the driver.

A driverless car would be beneficial to many people, but they would be even more beneficial to the companies and factories that construct and sell the cars.

They would be expensive to buy, but would pay off themselves every time an incident is avoided.

Not to mention, eventually the regular cars would be phased out.

This means that car companies who build and sell the driverless cars would be making a sensational amount of money.

Finding the equptment to build all the driverless cars would be expensive and time consuming, but the process would be worth it to have all the new cars made and on the roads.

Driverless cars would change the way the world works.

There would be no ""new driver anxiety"" when teens get their liscenses.

There would be a dramatic decrease in the death-by-vehicle statistics.

It would not be suprising if one day people no longer needed to buy cars, similar to the article when Sergey Brian said, ""...such cars would change the world."".

There are so many options that arise when considering such an invention.

What is a city decided to have fleets of taxis and buses with driverless cars?

Driverless cars would be an added benefit.

Then no one would have top buy a car and spend the money to take car of it with upkeep, and car companies would still make a lot of money.

With driverless cars, the impact on the environmet would be very much less than those cars of today.

The options and pros are endless when it comes to driverless cars.

The world would experience a shift in function if driverless cars were introduced.

The number of deaths and accidents involving automotives would decrease exponetially and life would be a little less stressful for many.

The attack on the environment would be lessened, and roads would be safer.

There are pros and cons for any situation, but in the case of driverless cars, the pros seem to greatly outweigh the cons.

The quality of life would increase, and the variable of the human driver would be eliminated. Driverless cars would be an excellent addition to the car lots and would be an amazing tool for people in everyday life.",0,persuade_corpus,,0

For instance, in the essay the author cites the example of a group of people who decided to raise funds for charity.

However, when they offered small rewards such as chocolates and movie tickets, individuals decided to contribute, proving that offers of money can indeed be an effective way to get people to act.

I feel that students should have to do community service. Not only does community service help others but, it also teaches good skills that students may use later in life. Community service also teaches students to look at the greater picture. That the world doesn't always revolve around them.

Instead of sitting at home all weekend and playing Wii, students should go out and help their community in various ways.

Even if some students say that they have other obligations in their life outside of school they should still be able to set aside a small amount of time for doing community service. For example, picking up trash in a local park will help reduce the amount of pollution. Or collecting canned goods would help feed the homeless.

Think about if every school required students do community service. That would be a lot of schools helping our country and our Earth. The community service does not have to be hard, it can be age appropriate. Taking part in community service will teach students skills such as leadership and honesty. If our generation starts cleaning up this world and making it a better place, I'm sure that we can teach generations after us to follow in our footsteps.

In conclusion I feel that students should have to do community service.

What they ""need"" or want to do probably isn't as important as giving back to the community. The community service does not have to conflict with the students life outside of school; it can be as short as one or two hours. Which is why students have no reason why they shouldn't help.

I am writing to you about keeping the electoral college. To me the electoral college is key to the United Stats of America. Why would we replace something that has worked for over 200 years? The founding fathers some of the greatest men to ever live came up with this idea of the electoral college, and now some congressmen want to just get rid of it. As you can tell this makes my temper itch just writing about it. This country has run on this system for grnerations but now people clam it is out dated. Now dont get me wrong I see where they are coming from but the only reason I've found that people dont like this system is either because it has some minor hiccups or that the canidate that the person favored lost. Now I understan how this can upset some one but it doesn't mean we have to compleatly abolish the system. The hiccups in the system dont even happen every election which to me makes the problems irrelevent. Well anyway i'm done ranting so you can continue on with you day

Beside that, they also need to release stressful after two or three hours from studying. It's a good condition for students to recharge and heighten their energy for the next efficient block when they take the classes of art but it wastes time for students who won't spend time to practice it.

Today, studying in high school, which turns to boring with almost students because they can't locate where they are, what they are interested in at school. In that case, finding the funny things, which is the best way to counter that situation, is helping us to reduce stressful and recharge us from hold blocks study. For example, there are multiple choices for us like enrolling a band, joining a drama, taking part in an art class for making motivation in studying . We must be required to take those classes because that also is what we choose.

Beside that, choosing to sign up an art class are not only helping students to clean up their brain, which become easily to adopt information from the following block, but also increase efficient- adoption. For instance, after a serious block with full information in our brain, we must to clean it up by singing, acting or drawing class, it will help our brain feel relaxing and ready for adopting more information. It also depends on our type of favorite in entertainment that your body and brain can feeling relax when we are into it.

We agree that every students should be required to take those classes but if such classes won't be electives to select student's natural abilities; a huge students, who aren't serious about a music, a drama, an art class, will make other students feel uncomfortable. Like they are going to sleep or make noise which effect to everybody around to enjoy their fresh time.

To sum up, we know students should take a class from arts to make them feel fresh after a tired day or two to three blocks in a row to recharge and make our adoptive abilities improving; it help students produce motivation from school and make them feel comfortable without pressure. But classes of art still need to be electives to choose which students own availability to take part in that class to make sure they don't waste time in the block they even aren't interested in.",0,original_moth,"Task:

897B3478DC01,"Looking at someone can tell a lot about someones emotions but, the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) made a software that can calculate someones emotions. The software calculates somones emotions by seeing the movements of a muscle. It calculated da Vinci's painting of Mona Lisa and said that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent dishusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. It can expose if someone is bring a fake smile. I think this software will be very valuable.

A reason why I think it would be valuable is because it could calculate if a student in a classroom is bored or confused. The software could modify the lesson if a student is confused. This can help students be more attached with the lesson. In the text it says,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This is why the software could be valuable.

Another reason why is could it could be valuable for a student in a classroom is to see if a student is depressed. If a student has a mental disease like depression or bipolar, the software can know if a student is feeling depressed or if a students emotions change by seeing how their muscles move. The teacher can help the student if he/she has depression when a student is trying to hide it. In the text it says,"" They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This could help the software be more valuable.

The final reason why it is valuable is that it can tell if a student it lying or not. It can see if a student is tell the truth by just looking at their face. FACS calculates major muscles in the someones face and exposes if someone is lying and experts say,"" Faces don't lie"". The evidence in the text says that,"" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-d comouter model of the face; all major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This would help teachers with students in the classroom.

The FACS would help many teachers with their students to make teaching more better. The software would even help video games to make computer-animated faces more expressive. The FACS would help companies and people to indicate someones true feelings without them fooling someone. They should add this type of technology to computers in the future.

B88301B4E6D7,"Principle ________,

I would have to agree with you that a B average is necessary to maintain a place on the schools sports teams and clubs. It is not only important that we show our rival schools how we excel at sports but academics as well. Although many of the ""star"" athletes may have poor grades it is important that they know it is a privilege to be on the team. A privilege that they must work for and honor. Clubs and groups are a privilege as well we should not allow them to join a club unless that club is study group.

While some people may find it hard to get a maintain a C average everyone is more than capable of excelling beyond that. I believe it is important that we focus on the intelligence of our students before we try to enhance them athletically Clubs such as photo, art, and drama are for fun and I guarantee their teachers are not having fun grading their papers. If they do not study for tests, ask the teachers for help when necessary, and get their work done I have no reason to believe that they should have the opportunity to represent our school at a sporting event or in a club.

On the other hand there are peers of mine in the school who are academically challenged while doing all of the techniques I listed above. With this exception I believe they should take two days a week from the practice schedule or club to be further assisted with this problem.

However, this is the only exception I would recommend. School comes first and students should learn this now rather than later down the road.

I would really appreciate you taking this letter into consideration. I not only demonstrated my opinion on this topic but a technique and exception as well. I am very happy to know that you agree and take these poor grades as seriously as I do. Your clear devotion to the students by making them work for such an honor. Who knows maybe this extra academic push will help them learn knew strategies for the game as well as making them value their spot on the team or club.

FF726A733C46,"I believe you should keep Electoral Collage. The reasons you should keep Electoral Collage is because you should let the people who want to vote have the right to choose who they want. Another reason is some of the people think that their votes dont count and the reason that they dont vote is because they dont think the precent will move up if they vote so most people dont vote but all they can do is at least try. Electoral Collage also helps you see how many people are actually voting for each person to be the president.

You should keep Electoral Collage is because i think the people who want to vote should have the right to vote. I dont think people could get to tell you who you can and cant vote for. I think if you are eight-teen years or older you should have the right to vote and no body has the right to tell you that you cant vote for a certain person just because they dont like that person.

Another reason you should vote is because if nobody votes they cant elect a president. The reason why most people dont vote is because they think that their votes dont matter. They think when the vote or when their whole family votes the percent will go up they just think they are wasting their own time. Their votes count just because it dosnt go up one percent when they vote doesnt mean that their vote doesnt count.

My final reason why we should keep Electoral Collage is because you can see the number of Electoral votes out of each state. Do the people docide to not vote for the U.S. president? Or do they just not care what the world is going to be like when the new president come do you like that they just dont vote for a reason or just because they dont think it is important. For an example alot of the states only have three votes. California has fifty-five votes in just that one state. California has the most votes in the whole U.S.

In conclusion, I think we should keep the Electoral Collage because you should let the people who want the vote have the right because you dont know if they change it if they will still have the rules that they have for the Electoral Collage. Another reason you should keep it so you can show people that their votes actually count and people know which president they should vote for by looking at the percentage of each president going up for election. The last reason is because they can see how many people are voting in each state and you can see if you are one of those people because if the state says that there was zero votes ina state and you know that you voted you would be able to tell if your vote counted or not most of the time it does.

F530741D2297,"Sure, here's my essay response:

Hey there, folks!  Today, we're gonna talk about a pretty cool quote from Thomas Jefferson: ""The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.""  And you know what's super relevant to that? Being active! 

So, I did some research and found out that being active means doing stuff, like, you know, moving around, learning new things, and helping others.  It's like, the more you do, the more you can achieve!  And let me tell you, it's not just about getting good grades in school. Being active can help you in so many ways, like building confidence, making new friends, and even improving your mental health!  Like, who doesn't want to feel happy and stuff? 

But here's the thing, folks. Being idle, like not doing anything, can be super bad for you too.  It can make you feel unmotivated, unhappy, and like, you know, you're not really accomplishing anything.  And trust me, no one wants to feel like they're not doing anything with their life! 

So, what can we do about it? Well, we can start by helping others!  Like, volunteering at a local animal shelter or helping out at a community clean-up event.  It's like, when we help others, we're not just doing something good for them, we're also doing something good for ourselves!  It can make us feel more connected to our community and give us a sense of purpose. 

And let's not forget about making a change in the world!  Like, we can start small, like recycling more or using public transportation instead of driving.  It's like, every little bit counts, you know?  And before we know it, we'll be making a big difference!

Different forms of art can provide different levels of relaxation, including painting, drawing, building, and sculpting. 

Painting and drawing are popular activities for relaxation because they allow you to fully express yourself without needing any other supplies.

I believe your second policy on cell phones is the best choice. From being a student and experiencing what students do, your second policy is the right choice. I think that if you allow students to use cell phones during free times, they will abuse this rule and sneak their phones to class. My second reason is that students must pay attention to their school work, rather than their friends. Finally, my last reason is that students will get into trouble being allowed to use them in school. From being a student in school for many years, I know that your second policy is the better choice because kids my abuse the rules, won't be concentrating on their work, and they will get in trouble.

If students are allowed the use of cell phones during free time only, most would abuse this policy. During lunch or free time, children will have conversations on their phones with their friends. After lunch, these students will still be in a conversation and will continue it. Students will be sneaking their phones into classes just to finish talking to their friends. This policy will be abused by these kids and more and more kids will have phones in class than intended.

Banning phones in school is the right choice because school is a place of learning. If students do use their cell phones, they will not be paying attention to the teacher or what they need to know. Without the second policy, students' grades will drop lower and lower because they are not learning what they need to. This is just one more reason why the only way to go is to ban phones in schools at all times.

If cell phones are allowed in school, there is a chance that children will get into trouble. Many stories have been heard on the news about teenagers getting hurt from cell phone use. If students are allowed to use cell phones, who's to say they will always use them properly. Phones should be modified by parents so that their children are safe. The second policy is the only choice because it will prevent the dangers of phone use from happening.

As a current student in middle school, I have learned how children use cell phones. If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt.

6D9728CB8711,"As an 8th grade student, I believe that extending school one and a half hours each day could have several benefits for students. Firstly, with more time in school, students could delve deeper into their subjects and learn more. For instance, they could spend more time on math problems, conduct more experiments in science, and explore more topics in social studies. This could lead to better understanding and retention of the material, which is crucial for academic success.

Another benefit of extended school hours is that it could provide more time for extracurricular activities. Many students enjoy participating in sports, music, or other hobbies, but don't have enough time to pursue them properly. With more time in school, students could join clubs or teams, which could help them develop their interests and passions. This could also help them make new friends and feel more connected to their school community.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to extending school hours. One of the main concerns is that students may feel overwhelmed with the additional time in school. They may find it difficult to manage their workload, leading to stress and burnout. Additionally, some students may have after-school commitments, such as work or family responsibilities, that make it difficult to attend extended school hours.

Despite these drawbacks, I believe that the potential benefits of extended school hours outweigh the drawbacks. With more time in school, students could learn more and develop their interests and passions. They could also feel more motivated and engaged in their schoolwork, which could lead to better academic performance.

One way to motivate students is to offer more elective courses or activities during the extended school hours. For example, students could take a cooking class, a photography club, or a coding club. This would provide them with a chance to explore new interests and develop new skills, which could help them feel more engaged and motivated in their schoolwork.

In conclusion, extending school one and a half hours each day could have several benefits for students.

I believe that attending school in person is more beneficial for students than taking online classes. While online classes offer flexibility and convenience, they also come with their own set of challenges that can make it difficult for students to stay motivated and engaged. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why students should come to school instead of taking online classes, including procrastination, distractions, and responsibility.

Procrastination is a common problem for students, and it can be even more challenging when taking online classes. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track with their coursework. They may also face distractions from social media, TV, or other activities, which can make it difficult to focus on their studies. In contrast, attending school in person provides a more structured environment that can help students stay focused and motivated. They can also benefit from the accountability of having a teacher and classmates to keep them on track.

Distractions can also be a significant challenge for students taking online classes. While online classes offer flexibility, they also require a lot of self-discipline and self-motivation. Without the support of a teacher and classmates, students may struggle to stay focused on their studies. In contrast, attending school in person provides a more structured environment that can help students stay focused and motivated. They can also benefit from the support of their peers and teachers, who can provide guidance and encouragement when needed.

Finally, responsibility is an essential aspect of attending school in person. When students attend school, they are expected to be present and engaged in their studies. This can help them develop important skills such as time management, organization, and accountability. In contrast, taking online classes can make it easier for students to procrastinate and miss deadlines. They may also struggle to take responsibility for their own learning, which can make it difficult for them to succeed in their coursework.

One of my friends had a negative experience with online classes. They found it challenging to stay motivated and engaged, and they struggled with procrastination and distractions. They also missed out on the support and guidance of their teachers and classmates, which made it difficult for them to succeed in their coursework. In contrast, when they returned to attending school in person, they found it much easier to stay focused and motivated. They also benefited from the",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,8

A93471B62AF5," Hello, my name is Alex. I came across your opportunity to observe and learn more about businesses that interest me. I am particularly interested in understanding the right and wrong ways of teaching kids. I believe that I would be an excellent fit for this position due to my well-rounded nature, respectful demeanor, and responsibility.

Being well-rounded is a trait that everyone should possess. I have demonstrated this in various ways, such as my ability to speak multiple languages, understand children, and tolerate them. Speaking multiple languages is an asset, especially when dealing with students from diverse backgrounds. For example, if I had a Spanish student in my class, I would be able to converse with them and make them feel comfortable. Additionally, my interest in the job shows that I am committed to being a valuable asset to your team.

Respect is another trait that I take very seriously. I show respect to everyone, regardless of their position or relationship to me. I believe that respect is essential in any workplace, and it is a quality that I will always carry with me. For instance, if I were to come to work in a bad mood and speak negatively to my colleagues, I could lose my job. Therefore, I always strive to be in the best attitude possible, even when dealing with challenging situations outside of work.

I am confident that I can handle any amount of responsibilities that come my way. If you were to give me two stacks of paper and two days to fill them out, I would complete the task. I am also willing to follow any orders or instructions, even if I don't necessarily agree with them. For example, if I were given the opportunity to work with kindergartners who were struggling to comprehend the material being taught, I would stay after school with them until they understood and were able to complete the task. I would go above and beyond to help these children succeed.

In addition to my well-rounded nature, respectful demeanor, and responsibility, I am also a great communicator. I am confident that I can communicate effectively with students, parents, and colleagues. For example, if I were to have a student who was struggling with a particular concept, I would take the time to explain it to them in a way that they could understand. I would also make sure to communicate regularly with parents, keeping them informed of their child",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

D3C9A3C2BB08,"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! ð For this essay, I had to research the positive and negative effects of technology on people's lives. I know, it's a pretty big topic, but I'm gonna give it a shot! ð¤

First, let's talk about the positive effects of technology. ð One of the biggest pros is that technology makes our lives way more convenient! Like, think about it â we can order food, clothes, and even groceries online nowadays! ððð¥ It's so much easier than going to the store and fighting crowds. Plus, we can communicate with our friends and family super easily through social media and messaging apps. It's like, we can be besties no matter where we are in the world! ð

Another cool thing about technology is how it can help us learn new things. ð There are so many educational websites and apps that make learning fun and interactive! For example, I use Duolingo to learn Spanish, and it's way more fun than sitting in a classroom and listening to a teacher talk. ðªð¸ Plus, technology can help us connect with experts and learn from them, even if we're not in the same place. Like, I could be in my pajamas at home and still learn about space exploration from a NASA scientist! ð

But, like, there are also some negative effects of technology, you know? ð One of the biggest downsides is how it can be super distracting! Like, have you ever tried to do homework while also scrolling through TikTok? ð¤·ââï¸ It's like, impossible! And too much screen time can be bad for our eyes and brains. ð It's important to take breaks and do stuff that doesn't involve technology, like reading a book or playing outside. ððï¸

Another negative effect of technology is how it can be really addictive! ð Like, I know people who can't put their",1,llama2_chat,Task: Research the positive and negative effects of technology on people's lives. Include examples of each in your research.,6
B9A542B2C36C,"The decision of whether to attend classes in school or take classes at home is an important one for students to make. Taking classes at home has numerous advantages. For example, students can work on their own schedule, avoid distractions such as conversations with friends, and have more flexibility with practice and assignments. Learning at home also eliminates the need to travel to and from school, which can save time and money. 

However, there are downsides to learning at home. With no designated teachers, students may have difficulties finding help when they need it. Furthermore, without the strict accountability of classroom settings, students may have a harder time staying motivated and on top of their work. Furthermore, learning from home may also lag behind in terms of academic advancements and the use of new technologies compared to those available in school classrooms. 

Consulting with teachers, counselors, parents, and peers can help students make an informed decision about whether learning at home or in school more closely aligns with their individual academic goals.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Research the pros and cons of taking classes at home versus taking classes in school for students.,4
8B7A871FC14B,"The electoral college is a process,not a place. are founding fathers established it so that congress and election of the president by popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral college consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for the president vice president an the counting of the electoral votes by congress. thew number of electoral college consists of 538 electors. majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Why do the state of senator wish to take away electoral college votes? because they think there is to much voting bc under the electoral college system voters vote not just for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. but who pick the electors? who are the electors? the electors can be anyone that not holding public officean they pick the electors by the state. that how voters sometimes get confused about electors and vote. But the outcome of all this is that electoral college vite is possible an its less likely to dispute over the popular vote. A electoral vote is possible because the total number of vites is 538 is an even number. So to rap it all up it can be argued that the electoral collge method of selecting the president may turn off pontenial voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. so state senator i think we should keep the electoral college.

B7C150A40F86,"It is known, that students truly enjoy the most they can any break of the year. Giving a break to students in the evening and all summer, is better for their process of graduation. That is why, students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating.

First of all, since students have so much schoolwork and homework to study, they often need a break, so that way they can relax in their home and do other activities with their family that are not related to school. Summer is a season in which students need to go out in vacations and spend time with their family as well. Generally, not every students and their families get to spend so much time all together in the evenings, that is because of their routine. Most parents have from their jobs summer break, and they prefer enjoying it together with their children. It would be unfair for them to have to not enjoy that much their summer with their children just because the students have courses during the summer.

Another reason of why students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating, is because after they graduate, they are more prepared for the career they decide doing. It would not be a recommendable period of time having three years of high school for students that still need to keep studying and preparing themselves for the career that they are going to study in college. The students can get more experience while they are reaching to their goal which is their graduation.

In high school, every student should have at least an idea of what they are going to be dedicating themselves for the rest of their lives, and most of them suffer by not knowing what career to choose. Some students may say that they would really wish graduating as soon as possible, but the fact is, that by being in a hurry of getting out of high school with a diploma, they would make the mistake by maybe choosing the wrong career in college for themselves, or even maybe deciding to not go to college just because they did not have the enough time of high school to think and decide the options that colleges offer. Giving students more time for this particular decision is a good way to let them know what they are capable of doing in their future.

In conclusion, students having four years of high school includes many benefits that can help them to be more prepared for college, rest more in summer, and giving them a better process of high school for their future in college and job. Students can challenge themselves by experiencing the traditional four years of high school and see the advantages of the result that they reached which will be very beneficial for them.",0,original_moth,"Task:

A54A1822C7AE,"Dear Senator,

We the people of the United States of America, desire a president who will not only care for the wellbeing of the citizens, but know what to do during times of crisis. The Electoral College is but one method of deciding this. There are many reasons as to why we need the Electoral College, and there are many reasons one can list of why we do not need it. If we were to get rid of the Electoral College completely and determine the win on the vote of the American citizens, chaos would ensue. Let's be honest, there are plenty of voters who have no idea what they are doing. If America were to base who would lead and call the shots of the country on the votes of everybody, then one person would end up being in office who is no better a ruler than a goldfish.

The Electoral College is noted as a process, not a place. This is correct. You don't just walk up to the Electoral College and say ""hey, this is who you should put into office"". Each state in the U.S. has a certain number of representatives(electors). For example, D.C.(is treated like a state) has 3 electors. People may say that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. While in some aspects this can be true, but if the electors know what they are doing and are willing to stay true to their country, then maybe the correct person would be elected in. The EC is known to require a Presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A trans-regional appeal is when one area of the U.S. is known to be in favor of the presidential candidate.

Among the other things the Electoral College is known as being, it has been widely regarded as an anachronism. An anachronism is a person or thing that seems to belong in the past and not fit into the present time. While yes, the Electoral College is very old, it does have its uses. It is perhaps one of the final things that will determine what direction this great country gets set into, be it forwards or backwards. The larger the population of a state, the larger number of electors it has. Most of the states in the U.S. have what is called a ""winner takes all"" system. This system will award all of the electors to the presidential candidate that wins the election.

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, what is known as the AFL-CIO, and the U.S Chamber of Commerce all agreed on just one thing. That thing that they all agreed on was to abolish the Electoral College. Over sixty percent of the U.S. population would rather have a direct electionÂ  over what we currently use. Out of all the arguments against the Electoral College, one of the ""best"" is the Disaster Factor. One of the other worrying views on the Electoral College is what would occur if there were to be a tie in the vote. If a tie were to occur, the election would thus be thrown in the hands of the House of Representatives.

While there are many reasons to like, and dislike the Electoral College, one of the most re-assuring should be that it (most of the time) will keep idiots out of the Oval Office. Among the reasons to dislike the Electoral College is that it is unfair, and keeps the majority of American people from using their voice. The Electoral College is the fine line between a country going backwards and causing the rest of the world to hate it, and a country going forwards, causing the rest of the world to hold it to a higher degree. If theres anything that the American people should want, it is a powerful and respectable leader who will do anything and everything they can for the citizens. Sincerely,

An American.       Â        Â Â Â Â     ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
BCF16DEB277E,"Hey there!  So, I know this might sound kinda cheesy, but I think it's super important to talk about how our behavior and professionalism can influence others. Like, think about it, if we're always acting cool and stuff, people are gonna think it's okay to be cool too, you know? And if we're always being responsible and stuff, people are gonna think it's cool to be responsible too. 

Anyway, I've noticed that when I'm in a good mood, people around me tend to be in a good mood too. Like, if I'm laughing and smiling, people are more likely to laugh and smile too. And if I'm being super focused and getting my work done, people are more likely to be motivated to do the same. It's like, if I set the tone, they'll follow suit. 

For example, there was this one time when I was in math class and I was really struggling to understand a concept. But instead of getting frustrated and giving up, I decided to take a deep breath and ask for help. And you know what? The teacher was super supportive and helped me figure it out!  And after that, I was way more confident in my abilities and I started to enjoy math more. And you know what that means?  More A's for me! 

Another time, I was hanging out with my friends and we were all talking about how we wanted to be more involved in our school. So, I suggested that we start a club for environmental awareness. And you know what? We actually did it!  And now we're all working together to make our school more eco-friendly. It's like, if I showed them that it was possible, they were more likely to join in and make it happen. 

So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that example is super important. Like, if we want people to be more responsible, we need to be responsible ourselves. If we want people to be more confident, we need to be confident ourselves. And if we want people to be more involved,",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

Dear Whom It May Concern,

Not allowing kids to have phones out at school it the best option.

Not having the phones would mean that they could focus more in class and not be distracted so much.

Kids would be involved with more drama if phones were allowed at school.

Inappropriate text messages and pictures could be sent while at the school, via cell phone, and most parents would not like their children to be involved with this.

One reason phones should not be allowed at school is distractions.

Kids already get distracted very easily and don't pay attention in class.

With the phones, they wouldn't pay attention any more than they already did.

They would be too busy texting or on the phone with someone than to be studying for a test, or finishing homework.

Another reason phones should not be allowed is more drama would be started.

Rumors start drama, and no one likes drama.

Rumors are mainly started by texting, and with phones kids would have the opportunity to text and spread rumors more than they do without them.

Drama can cause conflicts between teachers and students, students and parents, parents and teachers, and students and students.

The last reason phones should not be allowed is they are not necessary.

Now kids aren't allowed to have phones and some choose to not obey the rules.

If caught, they are punished for not obeying the school rules.

Kids can fully function without their phone in their hands the whole time.

Obviously since phones aren't allowed now and children can talk to each other and carry on their social lives, there is no point in having them at school.

No phones at school is the best decision there is.

Although some kids may need music to study or work to their fullest extent, they can do that home.

Phones can cause so many problems between people, and no one wants to bring that into the school. The policy on no phones allowed at school should stay the way it is.

To start with, not having a car helps the enviroment. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in th eUnited Stated."" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, parragraph 5). Without cars the air will become cleaner and people won't have all the polution in the air. Our air will get better if we start not having cars.

Also, another advantage is that people will get healthier. No polution gives people healthier air and with no cars people will have to walk everywhere or bike. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular swuare mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are bing adopted around the world in attempts to make the suburbs more compact and more accessible to the public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, parragraph 6). Ones destination will be a walk away not miles. People will just walk, bike, and if their destination is far away one will take public transportaion. One will become more active without cars.

Finally, driving is comming to an end. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the Untied States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortutious assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (The end of car culture, paragraph 29). Gas cost more, people are getting hurt while texting and driving, and some people just don't know how to drive. People seem to be getting over cars. This could help the enviroment. Driving just isn't a priority.

In conclusion, having no more cars would benifit people. The enviroment will be better and people are getting over cars anyways. Why drive a car that harms the air, when one could simpily walk or ride a bike making one healthier too? Not having cars would help.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
73234AB62383," Would you be willing to add two more hours to your school schedule if you worked for four days and ten hours? In my opinion, I don't believe it's necessary. There are several reasons why I feel this way.

Firstly, some students prioritize spending time with their families. This is especially true for those who live far away from their loved ones and want to spend quality time with them before they leave. Additionally, some students may want to spend more time with their grandparents, who may be elderly and require assistance. Furthermore, some students may want to hang out with their cousins, who they may not have seen in a while. Students value their family time and may feel that it's more important than working for an extended period.

Secondly, some students have to go home early to take care of other responsibilities. For example, they may have to babysit their siblings or go straight to work. Some students may also have to attend after-school activities, such as sports practices, which may not allow them to stay in school for the full ten hours. These students may feel that they have to balance their school and personal responsibilities and may not have the time to work for an additional two hours.

Finally, some students may want to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. After school, students may want to hang out with friends, go shopping, or spend time with their parents. They may feel that they only have a limited amount of free time and want to make the most of it.

In conclusion, I believe that it's not necessary to add two more hours to the school schedule. While some students may value working for an extended period, others may prioritize their family, personal responsibilities, or free time. It's important to consider the needs and preferences of all students and find a balance that works for everyone.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

40adb735b453_04112023,"The Promise and Perils of Driverless Cars

The development of driverless cars brings both great promise and causes for concern. On the one hand, these vehicles could help solve many problems and enhance people's lives. However, adopting this new technology also introduces risks that must be addressed. 

One major benefit of driverless cars is improved safety. According to the article, most accidents are currently caused by human error in driving. By taking humans out of the driving equation, autonomous vehicles could significantly reduce collisions. Every year, car accidents lead to countless injuries and deaths that driverless cars may help prevent. For those who cannot drive themselves due to age or disabilities, these vehicles would restore their mobility and independence. Reduced traffic as cars communicate could also lessen congestion and air pollution in our cities.

However, the technology may not be perfect or fully tested. The article notes that programmers would have to anticipate every possible scenario on the road, which is an immense challenge. It is realistic to expect software or sensor failures that could lead to accidents, at least initially. Since the cars would be programmed, there are also concerns about hacking or data privacy breaches. Some argue this new technology may even eliminate driving jobs. Before widespread adoption, more research and regulations are needed to address safety and security concerns thoroughly. 

In conclusion, while driverless cars show promise for solving transportation problems, their risks should not be ignored or downplayed. With more development and testing to shore up the technology's reliability, alongside prudent policy work to manage disruptions, autonomous vehicles could fulfill their potential to revolutionize travel while protecting users and society. Overall progress towards driverless cars seems inevitable and beneficial - if implemented carefully and conscientiously over the long run.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,9
1d16af20,"Life without cars may seem like a distant dream, but dreams are becoming a reality with new expiremental towns, banning of driving in some cities, and a national day without cars. Cars are causing, in some cases, more and more pollution everywhere. Although we ignore the signs of pollution everyday, we must face the fact that we are polluting our planet, and something needs to be done about it.

Vauban, Germany. A little city that has a strange law, to live in this city, you must give up your car or pay 40,000 to park it. As a result, ""70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here"" stated Source 1. Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and a media trainer stated, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". This new form of separate suburban life from auto use is called ""Smart Planning"". passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States. With Smart Planning, we can cut back on greenhouse gasses and start to breathe cleaner, healthier air.

Another example of over pollution problems due to cars is Paris, France. Source Two states, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". Congestion was down 60 percent for those five days. The reason there was so much smog in the air was due to the diesel fuel. Diesel fuel is the mail fuel used in France, 67 percent of the people there use it. Another factor could be the climate there. With ""cold nights and warm days caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Stated in Source Two.

Europe isn't the only continent seeing change. Bogota, Colombia was celebrating its 3rd straight year of, Day Without Cars. The Day Without Cars is a banning of cars and only busses and taxis are permitted. Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". For the first time this year, two more Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar are taking part in this Day Without Cars.

America too is seeing change with cars. The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005, but has been steadily dropping after. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the county was in January 1995"", states Source four. Although the drop in car usage will have a benificial effect on the environment, it will have negitave implications for car industries. Ford and Mercedes are already taking steps to rebrand themselves to ""mobility"" companies. Although car companies aren't the only ones changing their ways due to the drop in car usage. New York started a new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing. They have started building more bike paths and tunnel tolls are reflecting the new priorities.

Cars have done enough damage to this earth and its time we fix what we have caused. With all these new ecofriendly and car lacking ideas, we are so close to the isea where we can live without cars taking over our life.",0,train_essays,,0
EFBD506FC8F2," As a young girl, I have always been fascinated by the world of television production. I was always drawn to being in front of the camera, whether it was in presentations, ceremonies, or anything else that allowed me to showcase my talents. Despite the doubts and skepticism of others, I knew that my dream to work in TV was still alive and well.

My first opportunity to prove my worth came when my school principal asked me to create a commercial for a local festival. I was terrified and nervous at first, but once I stepped behind the microphone, I felt a rush of confidence and excitement. The employees of the news channel were amazed at my talent and praised my ability to make the commercial seem so natural and effortless.

From that day on, my passion for TV production only grew stronger. I continued to take on commercials and presentations for my school, and even started experimenting with my own homemade videos. When my family decided to move to the United States, I saw it as an opportunity to further pursue my dream.

I enrolled in a TV and Media Production class and was able to take my skills to the next level. I learned how to edit videos, record professionally, and took all that I had learned to a whole new level. In just a few months in this country, I had already had the opportunity to work on different news channels and school videos, and I knew that this was what I wanted to do as a career.

6E60D098D3AA,"Due to the fact that teachers give students many projects throughout the year and is based on teachers perspective this summer project will give students a chance to see what they have learned throughout the year. Students should be able to choose their own summer projects.

One reason why students should choose their summer project is because, their ideas of this project will be based on the studentsÂ knowledge. Students will have a better understanding coming from their point of view also their project will show that they have understood the lesson and the criteria for this project. For example, teachers will give students a grade based on the students effort and understanding. If teachers give students the same project, students will be tempted to copy from another student and won't deserve that grade. Students can gain higher level skills for not just for school but also for life. This is a great way to show teachers that the level of improvement that students have shown when choosing their own projects.

Students believe that teachers choose projects throughout the school year and this is their time to show what have they learned throughoutÂ the year. For instance, if students struggle with the teacher project and don't understand what the project is trying to refer students won't put as much effort in the project as if it was their own project. However, it has been said that students have a better chance in doing better when they but their mind to it. I as a student, believe that I do much better when I choose my own projects. Also us students don't get many opportunityÂ to chose our own project during the year.

Students will have a variety of projects to chose from. Students have the summer which gives them a better opportunity to think of ideas. Students can pick a topic that their most confident in doing.

Some might say, that teacher have a better understanding then students. There are many pros and cons to teacher choosing the summer assignment. For example, teacher might have a summer project that helps the students understand more about what they have learned throughout the school year. From what I have experiencedÂ students succeed more when they choose their own projects.

In conclusionÂ , It has been shown that students understand more from their own point of view than teacher point of view. Therefore, Students should be able to choose their summer projects.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
9A1E52D736D7,"Exploring the unknown ""great frontier"" of space has always captivated the minds of many people. Recently, there has been a lot of talk at orginazations like NASA and SpaceX about sending a man to Mars. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author writes about how studying Venus is a worty endeavor despite the dangers. The author supports this idea very well by describing the dangers of Venus and explaining the lengths groups like NASA have to go to in order to make it past these challenges.

First, the author supports the idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit by describing, in great detail, the challenges of exploring Venus. In the article, the author talks about the many dangers on and around Venus. For example, the article states ""...temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" By using these details about the dangers of Venus, the author is able to support his idea, because the reader is able to understand how dangerous it is to explore Venus

Next, the author further supports his claim by explaining why groups like NASA want to explore Venus. In the article, the author claims the reasons scientists want to explore Venus are ""...[Venus] may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The author also says ""...[Venus] could have supported various forms of life"" and ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable..."" These excerpts from the article help the author support his claim very well by comparing the reasons for exploring Venus with the dangers of doing so.

In conclusion, the author does a very good job of supporting his claim by describing the dangers in great detail and then comparing these dangers to the reasons people still want to explore the planet. In doing so, the author is able to effectively communicate with the reader about why NASA continutes to try to explore Venus. In the future, this article could inspire future scientists to come up with a new way to explore the surface of Venus.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

A39660CA003E," Imagine that you have a passion for photography but your school requires you to take music, art, and drama instead. While some people may argue that these classes are necessary, I believe that they should be optional because it's ultimately the student's choice to take them or not.

If you believe that these classes are necessary, then you're wrong because students won't take them if they're forced. They may enjoy the class when it's required, but if they're forced to take it, they may not do anything in the class. For example, a student who doesn't like art but is required to take it may still become a successful artist, but they may not be as passionate about it as they would be if they had chosen to take it. On the other hand, if a student fails a required class, the passing average of that class may go down, which could negatively impact their overall grades.

I believe that students should have the option to choose which classes they take, as long as they meet the necessary requirements for graduation. If a student chooses to take a required class, it may change their perspective on what they want to do after school. However, for some students, it may not change their plans. If a student chooses not to make a class required, their passing average may be higher, and they may have more time to focus on the classes they're passionate about.

0beb3e44cd8f_04112023,"Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. While helping the community is a noble goal, I do not think making it mandatory for all students is the best approach. 

Requiring community service risks turning it into more of a chore or obligation rather than an opportunity to voluntarily help others. When done willingly, community service allows students to support meaningful causes they feel passionate about. It also teaches important life lessons about civic participation and empathy. However, if made a mandatory assignment, it loses this meaningful impact and runs the risk of students resenting the work or half-heartedly going through the motions just to fulfill a requirement. 

A better alternative might be to strongly encourage volunteer work but make it an optional extracurricular choice. Students who genuinely want to tutor, clean parks, or assist nonprofit groups could receive credit for their time. However, no one would be forced into service they do not care about or have the time for. Balancing academics, activities, jobs and personal lives is challenging for high schoolers. Community service is excellent for those who can make room for it, but should not be an added burden on those with full plates already.

Promoting the value of volunteering through exemplary student role models could still foster widespread participation without a mandatory policy. Recognizing top volunteers on awards day or highlighting their stories may inspire others to join in out of their own interest, not obligation. A flexible, volunteer-focused approach has potential to increase overall hours volunteered while avoiding resentment of an imposed requirement. 

In conclusion, while community service clearly provides benefits, requiring it of all students risks overburdening some and reducing its positive impact. A voluntary, encouragement-based model harnesses the power of choice and inspiration to engage students as thoughtful citizen volunteers, not forced labor. For these reasons, I do not recommend making service mandatory for all, but fully support its promotion as an impactful extracurricular choice. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

DC2E6750CDEC,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that being true to oneself is the key to success and happiness in life. In today's society, there is a constant pressure to conform to certain expectations and standards, but I believe that trying to fit into a mold and follow an external type is detrimental to our ability to take advantage of our power wisely.

First and foremost, being true to oneself allows us to tap into our inner strengths and talents. We all have unique qualities and abilities that make us who we are, and by embracing these qualities, we can achieve great things. For example, if someone is naturally creative, they can use their talents to create art, music, or write stories. If someone is athletic, they can excel in sports or fitness. By being true to ourselves and pursuing our passions, we can live a fulfilling and successful life.

Secondly, trying to fit into a mold can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. When we compare ourselves to others and try to fit into a certain category, we often feel like we don't measure up. This can lead to feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt, which can hold us back from achieving our full potential. By being true to ourselves and embracing our unique qualities, we can build confidence and self-esteem, which can help us overcome obstacles and achieve our goals.

Finally, being true to oneself allows us to live authentically and honestly. In today's world, it's easy to get caught up in the pursuit of material possessions and social status. But when we prioritize being true to ourselves, we can live our lives in a way that is genuine and authentic. This means that we can form meaningful relationships with others, pursue our passions, and live our lives in a way that is true to our values and beliefs.

In conclusion, I believe that being true to oneself is the key to success and happiness in life. By embracing our unique qualities and talents, building confidence and self-esteem, and living authentically and honestly, we can take advantage of our power wisely and achieve great things. So, let's embrace our true selves and live our lives to the fullest!",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,1

We should keep the Electoral College but should change some of the rules. We should have a Congress that knows best about what we should do to make our country better. They should be wise with age and should know better than to elect someone who is no good for this country. The votes should be runned by the people and they should have a say if the person running to be President or Vice President should run at all. The people have the majority vote, so they should be able to have a say. It does take longer but it is what's right.

We don't need to get rid of the Congress but we need to be better about who we put in the office to run our beautiful country. They need to come and show us who they really are. Visit a town and get them your vote. The Electoral College has done some good things in the past but we should change it. The Congress needs to be made up of people who know what is right and which canadite to choose as our President.

If you are going to be in Congress and are voting for a specific party, then you need to stay in that party. The canadite is going to feel like you betrayed them after everything they have done for you. Just because your rich doesn't make it okay to betray what's right for this country. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)"" (In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep ourÂ  despised method of choosing the President, Richard A.

B3B9D116021C,"Setting high goals versus low goals has been a topic of debate for years. While some people believe that setting high goals leads to success, others argue that low goals are more realistic and achievable. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of setting high goals and argue that setting high goals is beneficial.

Firstly, setting high goals can lead to a greater sense of accomplishment. When you set high goals for yourself, you are challenging yourself to achieve something that may seem difficult or impossible. When you finally reach that goal, you feel a sense of pride and accomplishment that you may not have felt if you had set a lower goal. This sense of accomplishment can motivate you to set even higher goals in the future, leading to a cycle of continuous improvement.

Secondly, setting high goals can help you push yourself out of your comfort zone. When you set high goals, you are forcing yourself to work harder and be more disciplined. This can lead to personal growth and development, as you learn new skills and overcome challenges that you may not have faced if you had set lower goals. Additionally, pushing yourself out of your comfort zone can lead to new opportunities and experiences that you may not have had if you had stayed within your comfort zone.

However, there are some potential downsides to setting high goals. One potential downside is that setting high goals can lead to feelings of failure and disappointment if you do not achieve them. This can be demotivating and may cause you to give up on your goals entirely. Additionally, setting high goals can be stressful and may lead to burnout if you are not able to maintain the necessary level of discipline and focus.

In conclusion, setting high goals can be beneficial in many ways. It can lead to a greater sense of accomplishment, help you push yourself out of your comfort zone, and lead to personal growth and development. While there are some potential downsides to setting high goals, the benefits often outweigh the risks. Therefore, I recommend that you set high goals for yourself and work hard to achieve them.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,5

principal should offer distance learning for student that the way could not affect them because student might have a natural disaster in their neighborhood, student might be sick in such manner that could not attend school, that might affect their grade and they might repeat the year.

First reason, student might be absent for a reason like to be sick in such manner that could not attend school. All included student that is special that they go for a week or more in the hospital. Moreover, student sometime the doctor let a lot of appointment for them to check up or appointment with the dentist. Also, student who have allergies when the weather change they got affect in that they may not come to school. In high school, student sometime they get pregnant and the doctor let them many appointment including when they delivery they lose many school days and that affect many student lose the year or they may get affect their grade. Because we don't know in the future what will happen to some of our student that many of them don't find any solution of their problem. In fact, we don't know what it will happen if we don't give an opportunity to our students. We must pay attention to them if they lose many days of school sometime they are afraid to talk about their problem.

Second reason, student in their neighborhood might have a natural disaster also might need the distance learning in order to not lose school days. Sometime the weather get so angry that may bring accident or can bring tree crashing in our hose or may get rain and rain that could bring floating that may cause a lot of problem to some our students. In addition, the school bus may not get as in order to come to school. If it a student that walk that student could not get to school and the County could not cancel the school or even in there's no light and that may tell an announcement that student could not get informed about the school information weather. Because, if student get that problem the principal could not believe and it can not give an chance to those student to take the test or the exam that they had in class. After all, in the school no one care about you even if you have a teacher that it is so inpatient.

To end with, the school should offer the distance learning to some of our students. Student may got sick for a little reason and if they had natural disaster, we should care about it. If we find a student that always is absent we should ask them what is the matter or what is the problem with them? While some may argue that if we offer the distance learning student may not lose school days and even they could not lose their grade student could have benefit from this way student could not lose, however some may argue that if we gave the distance learning to student student could not enjoy this learning they just will playing even if we give the distance learning in computer they just see it they they will start playing video game or they just will watch a video.

911DD337DD61,"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that students should not be required to take classes in arts, music, or drama. While these subjects are important for personal development and self-expression, they are not essential for academic success and should not be mandated for all students.

First and foremost, students have different interests and talents. Some students may excel in the arts, music, or drama, while others may prefer more traditional academic subjects such as math, science, or history. Forcing all students to take classes in these subjects can lead to disinterest and a lack of motivation, which can ultimately hinder their academic progress.

Secondly, these subjects require a significant amount of time and resources. Students are already required to take a variety of classes, including core subjects such as English, math, and science. Adding more classes in the arts, music, or drama can be overwhelming and may lead to a decrease in the quality of education in other subjects.

Furthermore, these subjects are not directly related to future career prospects. While they can be valuable for personal development, they may not necessarily translate into job opportunities in fields such as engineering, medicine, or law. Therefore, it may not be beneficial for students to spend their time and resources on these subjects if they are not interested or do not see a clear connection to their future career goals.

In conclusion, while the arts, music, and drama are important for personal development and self-expression, they should not be mandated for all students. Students have different interests and talents, and these subjects require a significant amount of time and resources. Additionally, they may not necessarily translate into job opportunities in the future. Therefore, students should have the freedom to choose their classes based on their interests and career goals.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,9
62102D1B1A52,"In Winston Churchillâs statement on the importance of failure, he argued that failure is crucial for individuals seeking success. Identifying with this idea, I think of a time in my life when I failed and subsequently achieved success: when I got a low grade on a maths test, I worked harder to properly understand the material and ultimately did well in the following tests. Similarly, I can think of a friend of mine who failed his first driving test, but worked to understand driver safety laws better, and passed the test the second time. In both of these cases, failure was necessary for success. In agreement with Churchill, I believe failure is an essential part of the process of achieving long-term success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Read and analyze Winston Churchillâs statement on the importance of failure in the pursuit of success.

Some students can't just stay afterschool just because the principle wants them to and most of them have to take care of younger siblibgs afterschool. Around this age students start getting little side jobs to save up for things they may want so stay afterschool would not be an option.

Just because students don't stay after school doesnt mean they dont have nothing to do students also have sports and other activities to do outside of school. It could also be hard for students due to lack of transportation from school back home.

Students have other things they need to worry about instead of just going to stay afterschool for sports and other activites. Students may or may not want to actually be in a extracurricular activity but that should be left for them to decide themselves not the school.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
A77B230FF451,"School is known as the most stressful part in a teen's day. They have to wake up early, brush their teeth, get dressed and arrive before a specified time. For people in northern Virginia, it is a difficult task them. Because of this, many students end up missingÂ classes or become absent for the whole day. There are many other reasons for students missing school, such as being sick or having surgery. While this may be a small problem, there is a solution that solve it efficiently, which is online classes. Students benefit from having the ability to take online classes, because it assists students who are not able to attend class regularly, gives them the ability to take more classes than a normal school day, and provides them with more time to do activities outside of school.

First, online school helps students who cannot make it to class on a regularÂ basis. For example, Generic_Name, a senior at Generic_School, has had cancer for two years and spends most of his time in hospitals, or at home. As a result, he has a 2.2 GPA and is struggling to keep it there. When Generic_Name is in school, he feels very insecure and depressed because of the way his life is. People are always coming up to him and asking questions about his looks and why he is antisocial. In this situation, Generic_Name would benefit greatly from being able to attend online classes. Having that opportunity would give him the fair chances other students have to succeed. Another instance is Generic_Name, a sophomore at Generic_School. She has a disease that gives her a very week immune system, whichÂ makes her miss school often. She usually is absent for weeks, or even months. To combat that, Generic_Name tries to get any work she is going to miss early. The problem with this is her teachers only print out the materials for the week. She tries to get in touch with them for the rest of the work, but they always respond late. At the end of the second quarter, her grades are all C's and one D. Generic_Name is desperate to find a solution to get her out of the situation she's in. Like the last example, taking online school would be the best option for Generic_Name to bring up her grades.

Second, having online classes gives students the chance to take more classes than in a normal school day. In this case, Generic_Name, a junior at Generic_School, really wants to take Culinary Arts and Astronomy, but does not have enough space in his schedule for it. He is stuck between the two, because he really enjoys providing his family with cooked meals, but also is enthusiastic about learning about space and galaxies. He already chose 6 mandatory classes and does not want to take either one in college. This case proves receiving the ability to take online classes would be beneficial. Another example is Generic_Name, a senior who wants to become an engineer in the future. Because of his graduation requirements, he was not able to take Engineering 2 this year. to go to his dream school, Virginia Tech, he must take two years of Engineering to major in that field. He feels like he has no options left for him and is debating on changing his major. This instance again shows being able to take online school could give a person, like Generic_Name, a chance to pursue their dream career.

Lastly, the ability for students to take classes online gives them more time to do tasks outside of school. A scenario of this is Generic_Name, a freshman, that has to take care of his siblings while his mom is at work. He can only go to school one day a week, if his mom has off. This puts a great amount of stress on Generic_Name. When he gets to school, he has to go to each teacher and receive what he is going to miss for that week. Generic_Name's situation makes it even harder for him to take assessments, because he has to finish all of them in one school day. His mother feels very bad for him, but without her job, the family would be homeless. If Generic_Name was able to take online classes, he could take care of his siblings and be able to complete his assessments on time; It would also relieve the stress on him. Another case of this is Generic_Name, a 16 year old sophomore, who has to work 2 jobs to help her dad afford the rent. Because of this, she misses a great amount of school time to get hours. Generic_Name is even forced to take late shifts to make enough. She tries to make up her work whenever, but it is hard for her to find time to do so. She feels as if she will not pass this school year if no change is made. A simple solution to this is allowing Generic_Name to take online classes. That would give her more time to focus and complete school work, improving her grades.

To sum it up, students having the opportunity to take online classes would improve a student's grades. Likewise, it gives students the chance to take more classes, something that is not provided in a school building. To add on, it allows students to have more time to do tasks outside the classroom. In life, one option does not appeal to everyone. At restaurants, there are different combinations to order, or even unique sides to add on. At stores, there are different products that attract a separate group of people. Online school and video conferencing is the same way, it appeals to people who can not do their best in a classroom. No matter a person's background or where they come from, online school could be the little boost they needed to change their life and future for the better.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
6ef92dad,"As of right now, imagining an automobilefree world may sound crazy, but ambitious goals to end the use of cars has taken place. Suburban and city residents have taken quite a lot of thought into banning driving and giving up their cars, because of the great advantages that go along with these limitations. Reducing the use of cars has amazing advantages in creating a nonpolluted environment, it leads to an increase in exercise, and provides a way to save one's money.

Car reduced communities are being promoted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, swell as all around the world. Paris, France has enforced a driving ban to reduce the intensifying pollution all over the city, as explained in the article entitled, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"". If the pattern of banning the use of cars persists, the amount of pollution will be reduced, especially in major big cities, such as Paris, London and Beijing. Continuing this cultural shift ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" ""The End of Car Culture"". Limiting the use of cars would highly advantage and could possibly save our environment, if we conserve our resources correctly.

Hiking, biking, skating andor walking are all types of physical activities that are useful to get from point A to B, rather than using a car. People have began to organize their lives around how they can get to places by exercising, than commuting by car. Restaurants, shopping malls, and work offices are beginning to be located in highly populated areas and within walking range, so that the use of automobiles becomes unecessary. In Bogota, Columbia, people take a carfree day to promote alternative forms of transportation and reduce smog. Bogota ""has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" ""Carfree day is spnning into a big hit in Bogota"", in order to encourage citizens to get off the roads with their cars. Exercising has many advantages in limiting car usage, not only creating a nonpolluted planet, but also creating a healthier lifestlye for a person.

As gasoline prices rise, and car insurance rates fly up, less and less people are getting a license and have stopped buying cars to save money. A study done between the years 2001 and 2009 found that driving by young people decreased by twentythree percent, explained in the article, ""The End of Car Culture"". Leasing or owning a car is not a priority for many, as the use of taking public transportation or carpooling is available. Without cars, people are able to save money for important life necessecities, such as food, water, and shelter, where as a car is not something needed and may be considered a luxury in other parts of the world.

Commuting is not imposibble without owning a car. With forms of exercise and public transportation, many are able to get around without spending hundreds of dollars per week on gasoline. Less driving creates a nonpolluted and healthier environment, keeping our planet more stable. Eventhough owning a car seems convenient now, it may not be so convenient in the long run, as we may have to face difficulties that life throws at us. Wasting money on a car gives no advantages, where as a carfree environment is safer and more effective.",0,train_essays,,4
falcon_180b_v1_21,"I don't agree with the principal's decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities can be fun and provide opportunities for personal growth, they shouldn't be mandatory. Here's why:

First of all, not everyone is interested in the same things. For example, I'm not a big fan of sports, so I wouldn't want to be forced to join a sports team. I'd rather spend my time doing something I enjoy, like reading or writing. If all students have to participate in an extracurricular activity, some of them might end up doing something they don't like, which wouldn't be fair.

Secondly, some students might not have the time to participate in an extracurricular activity. For example, if a student has a part-time job or has to take care of younger siblings after school, they might not have enough time to join a club or team. Making extracurricular activities mandatory would only add more stress to their already busy lives.

Finally, some students might not be able to afford the costs associated with certain extracurricular activities. For example, if a student wants to join the drama club, they might have to pay for costumes or props. If a student's family can't afford these costs, they might not be able to participate, which wouldn't be fair.

In conclusion, while extracurricular activities can be beneficial, they shouldn't be mandatory. Students should be able to choose whether or not they want to participate, based on their interests, availability, and financial situation.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

C94A37408A7E,"Which policy would I want; 1. allow students to use phones during lunch and other free time or 2. don't allow student to use there phones at all. Which would be better? Who knows? Well, as a student I would go with policy number two. Reason for that would be because I like to have my phone available, makes me feel safe, and just feel weird without it.

Having my phone with me makes me feel important. Without it I just seem like some normal kid. Cell phones could also help in good ways. I could use if for researching, calculating and to help see what i want to write.

Also my phone makes me feel safe. To me, not having my phone is like driving a car without seat belts. Also know as dangerous. Sometimes when I think there's an emergency I like to have my phone so I could contact my mom, dad, sister, brother or anybody I need. Phones aren't just for having fun texting, calling, going on the internet or things of that nature. Some kids actually use them for safety reasons and emergencies.

Lastly, I just feel weird not having my phone. Its like a mom having to leave her son at a daycare for the first time. When I don't have a phone it seems like I can feel every text message and phone call vibrate right there in my pocket as if it was there. Then i look dumb looking for it, knowing its not there.

llama_70b_v1884,"Social media has taken over our lives, and its impact on society cannot be ignored. Social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter have become an integral part of our daily routine, and their influence extends far beyond just sharing updates and connecting with friends. Social media has the power to shape societal norms and values, and it's essential to acknowledge both the positive and negative effects it has on our culture.

On the positive side, social media has made it easier for people to connect with each other, regardless of their geographical location. It has provided a platform for people to voice their opinions and bring attention to social justice issues that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. Social media has also made it possible for businesses to reach a wider audience, creating new job opportunities and contributing to economic growth.

However, there are also several negative effects of social media on society. Social media platforms often promote unrealistic beauty standards and perpetuate harmful stereotypes, which can lead to body image issues, low self-esteem, and mental health problems. Cyberbullying is another harmful consequence of social media, which can result in feelings of isolation, depression, and even suicidal thoughts among young people.

Moreover, social media has contributed to the decline of face-to-face communication, making people more comfortable interacting with their screens than with real people. This can lead to a lack of empathy and social skills, which are essential for building strong relationships and contributing to society.

Social media has also created a culture of instant gratification, where people expect immediate responses and likes. This can lead to people prioritizing quantity over quality, sacrificing meaningful connections for the sake of popularity. Additionally, the constant stream of information on social media can be overwhelming, leading to a sense of burnout and decreased productivity.

In conclusion, social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. While it has brought people closer and provided opportunities for businesses and social justice movements, it also has negative consequences such as promoting unrealistic beauty standards, perpetuating harmful stereotypes, declining face-to-face communication, and creating a culture of instant gratification. It's up to us to use social media responsibly, acknowledging both its benefits and drawbacks, and working to mitigate its negative effects on our society.

As a grade 10 student, I believe that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. It is essential for us to understand both the positive and negative effects it has on our culture, and to use it responsibly to ensure that we can enjoy its benefits while minimizing its negative impact.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The impact of social media on society has been a topic of ongoing debate.

985A32A20F03,"Starting a career at a young age has been a topic of debate for many years. While some people believe that young people are more ambitious and energetic, others argue that they need more experience and education to succeed in their careers. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of starting a career at a young age and provide evidence to support my opinion.

On the one hand, starting a career at a young age has several advantages. Firstly, young people tend to be more ambitious and energetic, which can help them succeed in their careers. They have more time to learn and grow, which can lead to greater success in the long run. Additionally, young people tend to be more open-minded and adaptable, which can help them navigate the ever-changing job market.

For example, doctors and lawyers often start their careers at a young age. They go to medical or law school, complete their residency or clerkship, and then begin practicing their profession. By starting early, they have more time to gain experience and build their reputation in their field. This can lead to greater opportunities for advancement and higher salaries.

On the other hand, starting a career at a young age also has some disadvantages. Firstly, young people may not have the same level of experience and expertise as more experienced professionals. This can make it difficult for them to compete in certain industries or roles. Additionally, young people may not have the same level of financial stability as more experienced professionals, which can make it difficult for them to support themselves and their families.

For example, teachers often start their careers at a young age. While they may be passionate about teaching and eager to make a difference, they may not have the same level of experience and expertise as more experienced teachers. This can make it difficult for them to effectively manage a classroom and provide the best possible education for their students.

In conclusion, starting a career at a young age has both advantages and disadvantages. While young people tend to be more ambitious and energetic, they may not have the same level of experience and expertise as more experienced professionals. Ultimately, the decision to start a career at a young age should be based on individual circumstances and goals. It is important for young people to carefully consider the pros and cons and make an informed decision that is best for their future.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0
F2DF6570D8C4,"Having an active social life, happy parents, and learning new things are all very important, so why not satiate all three by participating in extracurricular activities? Extracurriculars allow for meeting new people easily, less complicated parent schedules, and being educated about all sorts of topics. These now mandatory activities will ensure school wideÂ joy by solidifying new and old relationships. There is no reason not to love extracurricular activities!

Firstly, social lives can and most likely will be improved by participating in extracurricular activities. Many people have a hard time making new friends, and becoming a part of something that has a common goal to be reached by all participants makes the friend-finding process much more simple. ExracurricularsÂ alsoÂ provide an opportunity for teamwork to be utilized between those who feel they don't have some sort of team, as well as those who feel they do.Â Not to mention that new friends typically means a support system, and support systems help people through difficult times. School is tough for many, meaning that increasing emotional stability by building support systems has never been more important.

Next, parents may find that placing their child in extracurricular activities will lighten up their load a little. Parents already have to deal with enough; from work to watching their kids to putting food on the table, it is difficult for them to just kick up their feet and read a book. While their kid is having fun, meeting new people, and becoming more educated, parents get a chance to catch up on missed work, relax, or more. There is also the fact that parents who usually pick up their kid from school may not have to do that anymore, at least for a day or two. Students can ride the late bus or carpool with one of their new foundÂ friends to get home.

Finally, students participating in extracurricular activities gain new experiences and knowledge about the world around them. Whether the activity of choice is SCA, a sport, or some kind of art class, students will ultimately have so much information about a subject that it will come spewing out of their ears!

In SCA, students learn about leadership, sports teach teamwork and athleticism, and art cultivates creativity. All kinds of new things can be learned about inside and outside of class.

Extracurricular activities are an opportunity that should definitely be taken advantage of, especially with all the benefits that come alongside them. New things can be learned, new friends can be made, and moods can be turned. Extracurricular activities give a chance for kids to grow as both people and students. Being happy is extremely important to living out a good life, and starting with something that inspires joy in people is always a good option.

34F995479008,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify and act on human emotions. It reads a person's facial feature and identifies their emotions. For example, if particular person sees an ad they don't like, the computer will read their expression upon it and acts quickly to make them satisfied. This technology can definitly be useful to students.

Everyday in a classroom a student will stop paying attention because they are confused or bored. In the article, it tells how the computer will try another strategy to get the student back on board with the main topic. This could be by making it into a game or maybe showing them a video that will help them understand the subject. This is an amazing technique to make sure no student falls behind.

There are so many ways that parents use to get there children into learning without any complications. Many students take online classes so they can go at their own pace. Most parents try to get their kids home schooled so they feel more comfortable with their surroundings. Some parents even get their younger children who have not been enrolled to school yet, started on the learning proccess. And although some websites might be helpful it does not always work out in the best way. With the new technology the computer, it willl be able to sense what the students pay more attention to, what the students are more interested in learning about. And with that, the computer will be able to find a way to get the students more on board with the learning proccess.

Many students have some big problems in their life and some people won't be able to help them. However, if the computer knows how to make them smile or feel better about themselves this might lead to a decrease in depression and teenage suicide events. With this new technology teenagers may not even have to worry about what is going on in the social media websites. They wiill be doing things that make them happy or satisfied with their life. This will be a major decrease in cyber bullying.

This new technology called the Facial Action Coding System will have a major impact on not just students, but with every teenager who has trouble staying on track in and outside of school.

Driverless cars are constantly being worked on. They will never stop being worked on. In all cases, humans are actually still needed while sitting in a driverless car. ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" This quote simply means that while sitting in a ""driverless"" car, humans are still required to pay full attention and take over when needed. Driverless cars should be true to their title. They shouldn't be called ""Driverless cars"" if humans still have to drive it. Also, this means that the cars are going to be constantly worked on because they will always have a new techonological problem that they are going to need to fix in order for the car to fully be able to drive itself.

Driverless cars are not accurate at all. People are still in need of some answers. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver, or the manufacturer?"" This shouldn't even be a question that the people would need answers to. Now, if driverless cars are going to be the next huge world-changer, than the manufacturues are somehow going to need to make the cars seemless. They are going to need better sensers, cameras, better navigation. They are always going to need to be better. Also, driverless cars should be something that a human can just hop right into, and relax while driving to work or to the grocery store. It shouldn't be something that humans have to be alert and scared while driving because they know that at any time, something could go wrong. If questions like this are being asked, the company just simply isn't accurate enough.

Manufactures are working on driverless cars all of the time. Does this mean that they have exactly what they need to make the cars flawless? ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems will be solved."" This quote simply means that the makers of the cars are still uncertain about whether or not they are going to be everything that everyone has been dreaming of. They don't even know if the problems that lie ahead will be solved! How could people trust their lives in the hands of such an uncertain and inaccurate company?

In conclusion, yes, a seemingly perfect driverless car would be totally awesome to have. It would be awesome to just relax and have the driverless car take you to go on a vacation or to work. The chances that people are willing to take is up to them. Driverless cars are still being worked on, they just aren't accurate enough, and the makers of these cars are still uncertain about them. Driverless cars just aren't ready and may not ever be ready to hand off to someone who intrusts their lives to the manufacturer or to the car.

4178B01DEEC6,"I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. That is the way we did the voting for years and why would you want to change that. The outcome of that might be a disaster because we haven't used the popular vote to decide a president. The first reason why I think we should keep it is because when we vote for the people that represent us they have lots of experiance in the politics area therefore meaning they have a better idea of who would be a better president. They have spent years learning all about politics so the ""most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.""(paragraph 20) In paragraph 16 it says ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee."", also meaning that the people we select to represent us is trusted people that will have the same vote as you for the desicion of president.

Others might say that its a bad idea to have the Electoral College but if thats how the system is set up then it should not be changed because if it does change then maybe everything would be different. Paragraph 15 says ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a mordern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" therefore going back to my first paragraph that is why you select people that you trust.

My third and final reason for my choosing is that the certainty of outcome is reletivly high. Like in the 2012's election . for example, Obama recieved 31.7 percent of the electoral vote copared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. Also in that same paragraph (18) it says that because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-ote victory in that state. Mr. State Senator i think it would be best if we just left the Electoral College method alone.        Â     ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
038FE8A0EE82,"Many people believe that the production of driverless cars isn't the best. I'm going to inform you as to why I believe that driverless cars are the best for our near future. Google cofounder Sergey Brin has done a series of tests to prove that driverless vehicles are not a danger to the public but can be very usefull. Not only are the good right now, but they are also improving little by little every day.

For starters, by having driverless cars, we will be able to decrease the amount of accidents that we have. This will happen by having no one at fault but the technology, and I know that sounds like I'm going against it, but I'm not. Not only does the car have special features that make it stop when it's too close to an object but if that fails then who's to blame? Right now we have drivers who are falling asleep at the wheel due to being tired, coming home from work late, and/or going out to parties. Driverless cars will help with this. They have a special feature in the car where if the car feels that the person needs to take over, they will vibrate the seat and even flash the windsheld, (although they're working on the windsheld) this will help keep the driver awake and reduce the amount of accidents we have.

Having driverless cars will also help decrease the amount of air polution we have due to factories and the amount of cars that polute the air.

It says in the passage that ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" By Sergey stating this, he's saying that we would reduce the amount of air polution. Not only is it reducing the amount of air polution but it's also far more comfortable than a bus.

Driverless cars will be an increasing business once it's not illegal in every state. This will happen because who wouldn't want a driverless car? This business will sky rocket due to the amount of people who would want a driverless car. This comes back to helping the economy. By having people buy driverless cars, this will drastically help the economy.

Many people don't like to be supervised while driving, but having a driverless car, this is a special feature. Not only will it help the driver back out of drive ways, or parking lots, but it will also help identify who was at fault if there were ever an accident. It also helps with no texting and driving, because the car will not allow it. Once the car feels that it needs the drivers attention towards the road, the seat will vibrate calling the attention of the driver to take over the wheel. Therefore the driver will not be able to text and drive. Not only is this benefical for drivers, it's also helpful for new drivers. Because they are not experienced they are more likely to be in an accident. Which is why the driver may need this feature while driving.

In conclusion, I believe that driverless vehicles are better for the environment because the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones. Not only will it help the environment it will help the economy. Therefore it will become an increasing production. This is only the beginning of something great. It's improving everyday and will continue to improve.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
FA483ED371E7,"when getting advice i believe you should ask more then one person. Asking more then one person can really help you get a better opinion on what your asking or need advice on. A good reason to ask more then one person their opinion when asking for advice is maybe they know more then you, they could have a different opinion on your topic, and they could have more reasons then you on why you should do something one way or they other or agree or disagree with your topic.

Sometimes when taking advice you should ask someone older then you. Because they are older then you they could probably give you better reasons to make a better choice. Asking your parents forÂ advice wouldÂ be great because theyÃÂÃÂ´ve been your age before so they know how to act in the situation. Also asking your teachers would be a good group of people to ask for advice from because they are very smart and more educated then then you are

Asking more then one person on their opinion could be very helpful if you are doing research. Because if they have a different opinion it could possibly be better then your opinionÂ and make more since. Or in some cases if you ask different people you could change their opinion to agree with you. Sometimes you can have the same opinion as someone but have different reasons to agree with the topic, so you could give them more reasons to make a better choice and they couldÂ give you better reasons to make a better choice.

With some cases people could agree with you but have better reasons then you on a topic. sharing your opinions with different people could make them agree more with your topic then they already do. If you are arguing one side of a opinion but donÃÂÃÂ´t have many reasons talking to more people could give you more and even better reasons to agree with one side of an argument or topic. But if you have the same reasons as them you could probably come up with better reasons to agree with one side of the topic that will encourage others to agree with your side.

I believe getting out in the world and putting your opinion out to others about a topic would help people agree with what you wanting advice on or agree with the topic you are agreeing with. Also asking for advice from people can help you get better reasons for people to agree with you. Plus if you ask for advice it can help you do thing the right way instead of the wrong way. For example if you are working on a car or building a house or even a school project advice can go a long way to help you because advice can teach you to do it the correct way or help you with something you messed up on. ThatÃÂÃÂ´s why advice is important to me and i believe it is a good thing. Do you think advice is good or bad?",0,persuade_corpus,,7

C133EB596A40,"The face on Mars was actually landform on mars and not a face if you still don't believe me I'll tell you some facts. In 1976 viking 1 was snapping pictures so that viking 2 could land while doing that it snapped a picture of a landform that looked like a face. Many people thought that it was a face but it wasn't. In 1998 they took another pivture but this time it didn't look like a face it looked more like a landform on the ground. Many people thought that the landform was created by aliens many others thought that it was made just like land forms on earth.

People still thought thet they were made by aliens many other people disagreed on it until 2001 when they took the final picture and they saw that it was actually a landform Garvin said that it reminded he of snake river of Idaho.

So after that happened mny people saw the truth about the face on mars and completely forgot about it. Some people still believe and talk about it but maybe those people are just the scientists trying to find out if there is more land forms that look just like the onein 1976. Many people say that they might find another one and start the arguement that it's an alien artifact or that it's just a land mass this time. Many other people study about this things and think they find out the truth about ehy this landforms look like faces. Even though some people think there is life on mars some might be true and some of it might be fake. Some people think there is aliens but maybe in another galaxy.

Many people might still think that mars landform was a sign form aliens and saying that they exist personally I don't think there is aliens in mars or any other planet in our solar system. That was just my idea about it I don't think my statement could be true. Maybe smart kid like a nerd would say "" scientists who are studying this kind of martian studies could get results of a real life alien that could be roaming around earth"". That's what I would think a nerd would say or maybe he might just say it even smarter than I said it, but that is my opinion I would like to hear about more peoples opinions on the face on mars.

E23EF596D2B8,"Graduating high school early is a topic that has been debated for many years. Some people believe that graduating early is a good thing, while others believe that it is not. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of graduating high school early compared to graduating within four years.

One of the main benefits of graduating high school early is that it allows students to start their college education sooner. This can be especially beneficial for students who are planning to attend a four-year college or university. By starting their college education early, students can save time and money by completing their degree in less time. Additionally, early graduates may have a better chance of getting into their preferred college or university, as some schools may have specific requirements for early graduates.

Another benefit of graduating high school early is that it can give students a sense of accomplishment and pride. High school can be challenging, and many students work hard to graduate within four years. By graduating early, students can feel proud of themselves for achieving their goal and for completing their education ahead of schedule.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to graduating high school early. One of the main drawbacks is that early graduates may not be fully prepared for the next step in their education or career. High school graduates who graduate early may not have had the same level of academic preparation as their peers who graduate within four years. This could make it more difficult for early graduates to succeed in college or in their first job.

Another potential drawback of graduating high school early is that it may not give students enough time to explore their interests and passions. High school is a time when students are encouraged to try new things and to explore their interests. By graduating early, students may not have had enough time to fully explore their options and to make informed decisions about their future.

In conclusion, graduating high school early has both pros and cons. While it can be beneficial for students who want to start their college education sooner or who want to feel a sense of accomplishment, it can also have drawbacks such as not being fully prepared for the next step and not having enough time to explore options. Ultimately, the decision to graduate high school early should be based on the individual student's goals and circumstances.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,7

You should allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are off during class time.

Technology can teach us many things. You should allow us to have our cell phones during free time and lunch periods because it wont get in the way of our learning, due to it being in our free time. The students would enjoy having their cell phones during the available times because they complain that you should let them.

I am responding to a policy about having cell phones at/in school.

If there was no problem with having cell phones at school then it wouldn't to bad having them, like how students have gotten in trouble in the past for using a cell phone during school.

Policy 2 doesn't allow cell phones at all during school hours for students to use or make important phone calls with which is not a bad idea to follow because then and only then students wouldn't take the chance of getting into trouble, getting it taken away, or having it get lost for a certain reason.

D58980F5EC66,"an online learning environment.

Distance/online learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. While there are certainly advantages and disadvantages to this type of education, it is clear that it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for students around the world who cannot access a physical school.

One of the biggest advantages of distance learning is the flexibility it offers. Students can learn at their own pace, on their own schedule, and from anywhere with an internet connection. This is particularly important for students who live in remote areas or have other obligations that make it difficult to attend traditional school. In addition, distance learning can be more affordable than traditional schooling, as students do not have to pay for transportation, housing, or other expenses associated with attending a physical school.

However, there are also some disadvantages to distance learning. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of social interaction. Young people in particular often rely on their peers for social support and friendship, and this can be difficult to maintain when learning online. In addition, students may struggle with staying motivated and disciplined, as they do not have the same level of structure and accountability that they would in a physical school.

One example of a student who had to learn via distance learning is a young girl named Sarah. Sarah lived in a small village in a remote area of Africa, where there was no school within walking distance. She was determined to get an education, but it was difficult to find a school that could accommodate her needs. Eventually, Sarah was able to enroll in an online school, which allowed her to learn from anywhere with an internet connection. While she faced some challenges, such as limited access to technology and a lack of social interaction, Sarah was able to overcome these obstacles and graduate with honors.

The effects of distance/online learning on social skills can be significant, particularly for young people. In a physical school, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers on a daily basis, which can help them develop important social skills such as communication, cooperation, and empathy. In an online learning environment, students may have less opportunities for social interaction, which can make it difficult to develop these skills. However, there are ways to mitigate this issue, such as through virtual group projects and online discussion forums.

BF195B6C980A,"Driverless cars would be an amazing new technology to introduce to the world. The ability to simply call a taxi and have a driverless car pick you up and take you wherever you wish, whenever you wish will revolutionize the way people get around. The technology may be in its primitive stages as of now, but soon driverless cars can help to automate many tasks that are currently being done by humans. Driverless cars will be an excellent addition to the modern world.

Not only does the driverless car make sense practically, it also has many safety benefits. If all cars on the road are driverless, they can communicate much better and have much less risk for accidents, unlike with human drivers who can only control the car so well. The automated cars will be directly linked to brake systems, so if there is a need to brake, the car is hydroplanning, or another emergency is occuring, the computer system onboard the car can easily and effectively stop the car from spinning out by applying specific amounts of brake to each tire, as explained in section 5 of the story. Another safety measure taken with driverless cars is the ability for a human to take over. Google's driverless car will notify its passengers if they need to take over the wheel, as explained in section 7 because the task on the road is too difficult for the car to perform. Assurance of the ability for a human to still control the car is very important, since even though the computer systems onboard the car may be very smart, humans have the ability to judge most situations better than any computer can.

One counterargument to driverless cars is the loss of jobs. This is not stated in the article, but it would be an issue with driverless cars regardless. Many people working as taxi drivers, trash truck drivers, freight truck drivers, or any job involving driving can lose their jobs. This is a problem, especially in the US where there is already a shortage of jobs. Although driverless cars will bring many benefits, the cons of them have to be talked about as well.

Driverless cars are a scary prospect. The thought of a car driving itself can make many people uneasy. If done correctly, however, driverless cars can revolutionize the way that many things today work. With companies such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan planning to have fully automated and driverless cars on the road and ready to go by 2020, driverless cars are just that much closer to becoming a reality.

Although, some may take this as an advantage or opportunity to try and fit in extracurricular activities and or to try and learn new things because maybe they want to pursue something different that needs more time of something and less time of a seven hour education course that restricts them of doing so because school takes up almost of half of the time in their every day life.

In the year 2000 there was a presidental election. The two canadate runnning were Bush and Gore. In that election there was a problem, Gore had won the votes of the people but Bush had won the votes of the the Electoral votes. Now the question is asked who should win, should the person who had the most votes from the people win or the person who had the most votes from the Electoral College win? This is something that has been going on for a long time, does the Electoral College over rule the people? This is an importain question that we the people should be asking, do we realy pick the persendent or does the Electoral College pick it and we are just there for show? The Electoral College is an out dated sistem that we keep because the goverment wants there to be a clear winner, but we know that is not what the people the people want the right to dicide.

The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers and made as a ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifies citizens."" The Electoral College vote on the President and the Vice President. It has 538 members and for there to be a winner a canadate, has to get a majority of 270 electoral votes. Your states allotment of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional degation. The problem here is that there is 300 million people in this contery and only 538 people get to vote on who is going to be president.

Also most states have a Winner takes all system were the winner of the majority gets all of the votes. For example florida has 29 electoral votes so if one canadate get 15 which is the magority he will get all 29. Because of this there is not an acurate repisentaion of what the state thinks.

The last reason it is not a good system is because the people's votes do not matter. In the 2000 election Gore had won the peoples votes and Bush had on the Eletoral votes. now Bush became president even tho Gore had won with the people. The biggest problem with the Electoral College is the fact that it over rules the people. If the Eletoral College wins it does not matter how many people vote for the other person running it will not matter.

She was shocked and didnt know what to do, she looked at the one she got wrong and it was ten plus ten, she was even more surprised and told the teacher. The teacher said, ""The answerÂ was twenty."" She failed math class all because of her dad making a silly mistake and because Generic_Name did not ask anyone else. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see if it is truly the right answer, in caseÂ the first person that looked at it did it wrong, you can get a better understanding of what your looking at.

First off, you can see if it is truly the right answer. For example, Generic_Name has science homework on fission and fusion and needs help, he tries the problem himself and thinks he did it right and goes on his day. the next day he turns it in feeling confident about his work, the teacher grades the homework and gives back the papers, Generic_Name knows that he got an A but instead he got an F because he didnt ask anyone to help him and he has to pay the price. Generic_Name has science homework on fission and fusion and needs help, he tries the problem himself and then asks his parents they star the ones Generic_Name got wrong so that he can fix his mistakes. Now that Generic_Name double checked his work he earned an A. Additionally, Generic_Name has a orchestra concert and doesnt understand a note on his piece, he acts like he knows it and goes on. The teacher said, ""anyone need assistance,"" and no one answered. The orchestra was in the middle of the piece and the note was getting closer and closer to Generic_Name. The note hit and Generic_Name let out a loud shriekÂ on his instrument and everyone looked at him like he was crazy, the judges marked down our score and we got a three one of the worst grades in orchestra. Generic_Name has a orchestra concert today and is having a hard time understanding one note in the piece, he asks the teacher, ""What note is that on measure thirty two."" The teacher says D. Now they had a great concert and they got a one, the best score you can get.

Secondly, in caseÂ the first person you asked got it wrong. For instance, Generic_Name has a lab in science and is working with elephant toothpaste, he wants it to explode just like in the movies. Generic_Name did all the instructions and his partner double checked we were good to go. Then we let it go and nothing happened, we were both looking at each other confused. The teacher looked at what we did wrong and we didnt put the acid in the tube. Generic_Name is in lab today, they are trying to make elephant toothpaste. Generic_Name looked at all the instructions and his partner double checked, we raised our hand to tell the teacher that we are ready and the teacher checked the lab and they forgot the acid. Now that they have the acid they can see the big, foamy explosion. Another example, Generic_Name has soccer practice and needs to know the play that the coach is going pick, the coach wasnt paying attention and said, ""Oh um lets do route five."" Generic_Name agrees and starts the play, he goes up the field passes to the player up top he passes back down and Generic_Name kicks it. The play is simple but the defense didnt here them so they started without the defense paying attention. Generic_Name kicks it and hits the goalie in the face and the goalie was stunned because he didnt see it and fell. If the coach was paying more attention then it wouldnt have happened. Generic_Name is at soccer practice and coach was notÂ paying any attention and Generic_Name asks what play coach said, ""Lets do route five."" Generic_Name nodes his head and goes on. The assistant coach says hold up, the defense isnt even ready. The assistant coach tells the defense the play. NoÂ one has to get injured.

Lastly, you can get a better understanding of what your looking at. For example, Generic_Name has a science fair that is due today and he dosen't comprehend one of the slides he is scared that he wont make the finals, but he turns it in anyways and the judges are looking at Generic_Name's science fair project. They are on the part where Generic_Name was worried on, they scoped it out very strictly and gave Generic_Name a score. He got second place all because of that one slide. Generic_Name has a science fair due today and he has one problem, he has a question on what to do on this slide. The other groups were nice enough to help Generic_Name out and get him first place. Adding on, Generic_Name was a straight A student and did not want to lose her streak. Generic_Name has a very important essay to do for a grade. It is worth sixty percent of her grade, she does not want to get a bad grade on the essay because then her grade will turn into a C. She has a question but dosent want the other people to know that she isnt smart so she keeps it in. On the essay she is nervous and is confused but she turns it in anyways, she regrets not telling anyone about her question. She got a B on it and now she is not a straight A student. Generic_Name has an essay due today and has a question she asks a lot of her class mates the question and they told her, Now Generic_Name is ready and prepared for the essay.

Generic_Name is having a test tomorrow and has a question, she asks her dad what is ten plus ten is he says twenty one Generic_Name believes him but still asks her mom, she said it was twenty. Now that I know the answer I can get an A and pass math class. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see if it is truly the right answer, in caseÂ the first person that looked at it did it wrong, you can get a better understanding of what your looking at.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
91377BE7D4ED," Imagine if you could learn from the comfort of your own home and have time to pursue your hobbies or interests. I would love to be studying remotely because I would never have any distractions, and I can just stay comfortable the whole time. People say that online learning is not as effective as traditional classroom learning, but I believe that it is more comfortable and convenient for students because they don't have to wake up early, dress up, or commute to school.

One of the biggest advantages of online learning is that it eliminates the stress of getting ready for school. Students no longer have to worry about what to wear or how they look, which can be a source of anxiety for many. Online learning allows students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be especially beneficial for those who have other commitments, such as jobs or sports.

Another advantage of online learning is that it gives students more time to pursue their interests outside of school. With no commute time and no need to wake up early, students can use their extra time to pursue hobbies, volunteer work, or even start a business. This can be especially beneficial for students who are struggling to find a work-life balance or who are interested in pursuing a career that aligns with their passions.

Online learning also provides students with a more personalized learning experience. With access to a wider range of resources and the ability to learn at their own pace, students can tailor their education to their specific needs and interests. This can be especially beneficial for students who have learning disabilities or who are struggling to keep up with their peers in a traditional classroom setting.

Finally, online learning is often more affordable than traditional classroom learning. With no commuting costs, no need for textbooks, and often lower tuition rates, students can save a significant amount of money while still receiving a quality education. This can be especially beneficial for students who are struggling financially or who are interested in pursuing higher education but are concerned about the cost.

In conclusion, online learning has many advantages over traditional classroom learning. It is more comfortable, convenient, personalized, and often more affordable. While some may argue that there are disadvantages to online learning, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. With online learning, students can learn at their own pace, pursue their interests outside of school, and receive",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

E3A2C937BE5C,"If you were or are a student who and was suddenly forced by your principle to participate in extracurricular activities how would you feel. you would probably not like to have to do something regardless of what you think. It could give you hardly anytime to do what you want to do with your life, maybe you like the idea of playing a sport or writing a story but not everyone has the time or interestÂ in stuff like that.

There is many negative effects on the students and teachersÂ that are caused by the principlesÂ decision to force extraÂ work on the students and teachers of my school, I believe that there is not reason for extra work.

being force to do something that you don't want to do is annoyingÂ but tolerable,Â but when it is not letting you have any time for yourself its too far.

There are many negative effects on the students. Anything can be effected by someones decisions or actions, I believe that the Principle's decision to force students to participate in extracurricular activatesÂ will only negatively effect them and make things harder for them in the future. Students have it hard enough going to school five times a week, having homework, and projects and still have to deal with life at home like choirs or maybe they have an after school job that they need to do, what ever it may be students have it hard enough and would not appreciate it if they were forced to do more than they already have to do.

Students are not the only onesÂ who are effected from this unfair change, the students need teachers to teach them and keep them in check.

Like students teachersÂ have a life of there own and don't need more work to do.

Their is not reason for extra work. There is no good reason why students need to work harder than they already do, if anything is is doing the oppositeÂ of what it is try to do, intended giving students a chance to find something new or get better at what they like it forces then to ether do something they are not comfortable doing or not letting people work on what they want to do in the way they want to do it. Nobody likes to be forced to do something, even if it is something they are interested in it only makes them feel like they are being controlled.

The reasoning is not right, not everyone is the same and some people don't have the option to try new things but this is not the way to do it and I think that many students would agree with me saying that.

this will cause more good than bad fro the people involved in this decision. In the end people are not just going to like something because you make them do it, you have to let them do things on their own, forcing people to do things will only make them dislike it.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
B0B703E881B7," I believe that phones should be allowed in school during designated free time, but only when students are in class and have completed their assignments. This way, students can use their phones to listen to music or engage in other activities during this time. However, when students are working on assignments or taking tests, they should be allowed to use their phones to access resources or take notes.

It is important to note that if students are caught using their phones during class time or when they are supposed to be working on an assignment, they should not be punished by having their phones taken away. Instead, they should simply be reminded to put their phones away.

Furthermore, if students continue to ignore the rules and use their phones during class time or while working on assignments, it is not a solution to simply abandon them. Instead, the school should take a more proactive approach and educate students on the importance of following rules and respecting their classmates.

In conclusion, I believe that phones should be allowed in school during designated free time, but only when students are in class and have completed their assignments. When students are working on assignments or taking tests, they should be allowed to use their phones to access resources or take notes.

a47cee9d,"Dear Mr. Senator, I am writing you concerning a topic that is very important to our country, and the citizens that preside in it. The electoral college is the current method of determining who will be elected as the president of the United states of America. As you know, it does so by allowing our citizens to vote for electors that then choose who they want as president for us. Citizens will most often vote for an elector that has sworn to vote for either the democratic or republican party's candidates for president. However, I don't quite agree with this method of election. Through my research on this subject, I have discovered that not only do these citizens not have the access to vote directly for who they want to run their country, but also that many electors go back on their word and vote for another party's candidate. I believe the system should be changed and the president should be elected through popular vote, and I'm not alone, according to a gallop poll taken in 2000, over 60% of the population agrees with me.

If the popular vote elects the president, every citizen will have their own choice on who they want as a president. In an electoral college, many people will merely have their votes casted aside becausetheir decisions or thoughts aren't the same as eveyone else in their state. Though some people say an electoral college is positive because it requires the candidate have more than just regional appeal, but if people in that state like a specific candidate, even if they vote for an elector, the rest of their state may not like that candidate, and that person's vote will be cast away.

Also, the electoral college doesn't always follow the peoples' vote. For example, if there were to be a tie in the electoral college, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. Since many people vote for a different party candidate than who they vote for, for the House of Representatives, they would not get their vote for president counted for anything, and the House may choose the president they don't want, without getting a say in any of it. Not to mention the 2000 election when Al Gore got more votes overall, but Bush won the presidency due to the unfair, outdated system of the electoral college. The electoral college puts the decision of who will be the president into a couple hundred peoples' hands, instead of every American citizen.

Another reason for changing the method to popular vote is the fact that all of the electors count the same. Since each state only counts for one electoral vote, the one elector from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, will count for the same as the 55 electors from, California, who represent 35 million voters. That simply isn't fair because it's the same as saying the opinions of only 500,000 voters in Wyoming are as influencial and important as the entire 35 million voters' opinions from California. The fact that not all American citizens, promised to be able to vote for who will lead their country and influence their everyday life, are able to do so is absurd.

Many people argue and say that just one vote won't make a difference, but there are 34,500,000 people in California alone that are being disregarded and not counted for anything more than the 500,000 in Wyoming.

Why should the people living in smaller states have more influence than those with larger populations? Why shouldn't those 34.5 million people in California be able to make their own decision and choose their own vote for the President? The entire population of every single state in the United States of America, that has the legal right to do so, should be able to vote, and to have their vote actually counted for something instead of just having their decision made for them by someone they've never even met. With the popular vote deciding who will be president, everyone will matter just the same, which is how it should be since we are all created equal, and we all should have the equal power to decide how our country will be governed and who will govern it, we should all be counted not just the small percentage that is at the top.

B07B4B4428AB,"My first experience of visiting a park was an incredible journey through a variety of natural and man-made features. I visited a Community Park in the city I lived in, a State Park in the countryside nearby, and a National Park in a remote region. 

When I stepped into the Community Park, I was overwhelmed by how much there was to take in. There was lush grass, an abundance of colourful flowers, and a wide range of trees and shrubs around the area. The park was also filled with well-maintained walking trails, playgrounds for children, and even a few ponds for wildlife. Overall, I was in awe of the park and enjoyed every minute of my exploration. 

The State Park I visited was a more remote location, yet it was full of life and buzzing with activity. The park was surrounded by thick forests, tall rolling hills, and sparkling streams. I was surprised by how huge the park was - extending as far as the eye could see. There were wildlife trails, wooden bridges, and plenty of picnic spots to explore. I was in awe of the beauty of the park and found it to be a great place for relaxing. 

My last stop was the National Park. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced before and I felt like I had stepped into a dream. The National Park was huge, and it was filled with remarkable sights such as towering waterfalls, snow-peaked mountains, and crystal-clear lakes. It was a refreshing and calming experience, and I was mesmerized by the breathtaking views of the park.

6B38FB57A1D3,"Students every year are increasing from skipping school. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students should all have an option to learn from home. Some people can work better with online classes or videos. Students are sometimes not in the mood to go to school or see some other people at school, if so they could stay home and learn there with their classes.

Some people can work better with online classes or videos. It can help kids if they dont really like there classes or if they are very independent. This is very neat and i think a lot of students would benefit off of it. ExpertiseÂ now with this new technology some people like working on the laptops so they would like if they could sit at home and work on class. Students can also not worry about getting up early and getting dressed for school, they can just get up and get on there laptop and do there class work.

Students arent happy to go to school all the time, but with this option they can do they classes online or watch videos about there classes. At home students can be conflictualÂ and safer. The work at home can be nice they can take breaks and eat food whenever they want, therefore they would still have to work on there class work.

however, student could always get distracted and not do there work. They can also choose just to take a day off at home so there should be a parent near to push them. Parents should be near the student while doing work so they can see what they are working on and help them if needed.

So i think thats why we should have an option if students should have online classes at home or watch videos about there classes. either or is a good thing i like the idea. Some people still like going to school so that is fine too. Like i said early parents should be in on this and be there with there kids if they do choose to stay home.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
978920CB10C6,"Nowadays, the image of summer vacation is something that is cemented into most children's minds from a fairly young age. It is a paradise of dripping ice cream cones, long nights without a bedtime, and freedom from the rules and regulations the school system imposes on them for nine long months. For students, summer often stands as an opportunity to explore the world on their own terms, rather than on their teachers' terms. In the eyes of many adults, however, this freedom is easily abused, leading to children choosing to sit in front of their televisions for three months. As they see it, children need the guidance and structure of the school system in order to continue learning. This can come in the form of required summer projects made to encourage students to continue learning outside of the classroom. While this can definitely achieve its goal, if the projects were to be determined by teachers, then they could actually discourage the intellectual curiosity of students.

Many students view the requirement to go to school as a prison sentence. Even though education is a tremendous privilege, the fact still remains that, in the eyes of many, school is not fun. For most people, it means being forced to learn about subjects they find boring and useless, while simultaneously following menial classroom rules. However, summer vacation serves as a glorious break from this oppressive rule. In those three months, many students feel an extreme sense of freedom to do as they please, regardless of what teachers have to say. Students spend nine months of each year under classroom rules, so why must it be extended into summer? Students will still be under the supervision of their parents, many of whom don't want their children wasting their summer. Individual parents are just as likely as teachers to take an active interest in the quality of their kids' summer activities, if not more so. If teachers were to design the required summer projects of their students, it would be a senseless extension of their rules into a time frameÂ devoted to giving children a break from school rules.

Many adults assume that, if children are given this freedom, then they will ultimately waste their summers. This valid concern supports the argument to give students a summer project in the first place. However, if teachers genuinely wanted to incite intellectual curiosity in their students, then giving them the freedom to design their own projects would be ideal. Most children are naturally curious and have the innate desire to learn and explore. While the assignment to produce a project may seem like a chore at first, the freedom to design it themselves can motivate children to explore something they are interested in or delve deeper into their passions. Summer break is a time that is meant for students to discover more about themselves and the world around them outside of the classroom, and even if it is assigned by teachers, a project of their own design could encourage them to do just that. Once summer ends, this strengthened passion for learning can also help them in the classroom.

The natural curiosity that students express contradicts assumptions made by adults who, despite their best intentions, sometimes neglect to acknowledge the skills, wisdom, and other exemplary qualities displayed by children. Often, students internalize the assumptions adults make, leading them to believe that their opinions and interests do not matter as much as those of adults. However, giving students the freedom to define their own projects could serve to boost their confidence.

If teachers could trust that their students are intelligent and capable of learning on their own terms, then students would internalize those values and learn to trust themselves. Letting students explore what interests them sends the message that their interests and passions are important and worth sharing. This confidence encourages students to tell themselves that the things they do matter, which would help to encourage them to stick with their passions into adulthood. Even though the adults in a child's life are a vital source of guidance, they also have to push the child to develop the confidence needed to function without their help. Students should be given the freedom to choose what they want to learn and focus on over the summer so that they can develop the confidence to learn outside of the parameters of formal education.

Summer is an important motivator for students, reminding them of the eventual fruits of their academic labor and giving them something to look forward to throughout the year. Even if summer may not always be fun and games, it should still be something kids can look back on and remember fondly. Everyone knows that tasks tend to be more enjoyable and meaningful when a person can perform them on their own terms, and the same goes for summer projects required by teachers.

If students are given a project of their own design, then the project could become another happy memory for children, something they can look back on as adults to remind themselves that learning and exploration should always be approached with a smile.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

llama_70b_v1901,"I think the minimum wage should be raised in our country. The minimum wage is the lowest hourly, daily, or monthly wage that an employer is legally required to pay its employees. It is a contentious issue in many countries because some people think it will help workers, while others think it will hurt businesses.

One reason we should raise the minimum wage is that it will help workers earn a living wage. A living wage is enough money to pay for the basic needs of life, such as housing, food, and healthcare. Many people who work full-time jobs still need government assistance to survive, and that's not fair. If we raise the minimum wage, workers will earn more money and won't need help from the government.

Another reason we should raise the minimum wage is that it will help reduce poverty. Many people who work minimum wage jobs are poor, and raising the minimum wage will give them a chance to earn more money and get out of poverty. It will also help reduce income inequality, which is when some people have a lot of money, and others don't have enough.

Raising the minimum wage will also help businesses because workers will have more money to spend. When workers get a raise, they have more money to buy things like clothes, food, and other products. This means that businesses will sell more products, and that will help them make more money. It's a win-win situation!

Some people say that raising the minimum wage will hurt businesses because they will have to pay their workers more money. But, this isn't necessarily true. Businesses can afford to pay their workers a living wage, and they should do it. Also, raising the minimum wage will help businesses by giving them a more reliable workforce. Workers who earn a living wage are more likely to stay with their job long-term, which means that businesses won't have to spend as much money training new workers.

In conclusion, raising the minimum wage is a good idea. It will help workers earn a living wage, reduce poverty, reduce income inequality, help businesses, and give workers more money to spend. Some people might disagree with me, but I think it's the right thing to do.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The minimum wage is a contentious issue in many countries.

I mean, I know they think it's for our own good, but come on, it's not like we're going to learn any more in that extra time. In fact, I think it's going to have the opposite effect.

First of all, let's talk about my sleep schedule. I'm already having trouble getting up early enough for school as it is, and now they want to add more time to the day? That means I'll be getting home even later in the evening, which means I'll be staying up even later to do my homework. And let's be real, who wants to do homework at midnight? Not me, that's for sure.

And don't even get me started on my extracurriculars. I'm already on the fence about joining the debate team, but now with this extra time added to the day, I'll have to choose between that and my part-time job. And let me tell you, I need that job to help pay for all the stuff I want. So, no, I don't want to have to give up my job just so I can spend more time in school.

But you know what? It's not just about me. It's about all of us students. We're already pushing ourselves to the limit with seven hours of school a day. Do we really need more? I don't think so. I mean, think about it. How much can you really learn in an extra hour and a half? Not that much, let's be real. And what about the time we could be spending on other things? Like, I don't know, extracurriculars or something?

And let's not forget about the impact it will have on our mental health. Adding more time to the day means more stress and more pressure to perform. And let's be real, who needs that? We already have enough stress as it is, between school and social media and everything else. Do we really need to add more to our plates? I don't think so.

As for me, I am strongly disagree with this idea because summer is the time for student to visit their famiy, their relatives, to do whatever they like, to enjoy whatever they love and sometimes learning too much might be somthing that some students could not handle.

First of all, summer is the time for students to come back to their hometown to visit their family. Some students, like me, came from another country so a lot of times we do miss our hometown. That is why having a three month summer break is truly a huge chance for us because that is pretty much the only reunion we have in a year. I will take mine as an example.

So if I can visit my family this year, I might have to wait a few years later to be able to visit them again.

Secondly, this is a period of time where students can do whatever thay want to do like doing some volunteering or club activities or playing sports or just simply doing their favorite hobbies. If we shorten the summer break, students will easily get bored when they come back to school because they do not have enough time to do what they like in summer. Nobody wants to study when they are bored. So if we want a student to return to school with lots of energy, we need to let them have a break. And that give me an example. One of my Vietnamese friend told me that even in summer he still have to take a lot of tutor classes. That is why if we shorten the summer break then lots and lots of Asian students will not even have time to do what they love!

Last but not least, learning too much might be something that some students could not handle. A short summer break meaning we have to go to school more than we need. I know that if we shorten the summer break we will have a longer winter break, but that is not the case for the country that does not have a winter break or a week off in fall and spring. A student could get stress if they do not have a proper break. Just check some examples on the news or internet, especially in South Korea or Japan. A lot of students suicide just because of learning too much. Too many homeworks and tests, pressures from parents and teacher,.... Very stressful! Not to mention that Asian students usually have a shorter summer break and winter break.

On the whole, I am not agree with this idea and along with fact that I am an Asian and I used to go through a very strict and tough education in Asia, I can never accept this. Students need to have some times to release their stress after a long year at school by visiting their family or doing whatever they like.",0,original_moth,"Task:

049719B4901D,"Dear state senator,

Electoral College shouldn't even be used anymore because it is widely regarded as an anachronism. In the Electoral College it's the electors who elect the president not the people. People should be able to vote for the president they want and not have electors elect the president. If the electors are electing the president they want then why even let the people vote only for them to be disappointed. Also when voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are many reasons for retaining the Electoral College other then there lack of democratic pedigree.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote wouldn't be the first since it has already happened in 2000. The reason is the the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney. Cause almost all states award electoral votes and a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number but this is highly unlikely.

Overall you will decide what is best for this state but just take in mind my idea how the Electoral doesn't benefit the people nor you.

Sincerly, a citizen who cares.       Â Â Â Â        Â Â Â Â        Â        Â Â Â Â     ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

My generation is racing into a universe of electronic devices. At just the flick of a fingertip, the entire world presents itself right before our faces. Each year carries a new device that makes our lives a pinch more fluid and relaxing. To be ripped from our sleek, shiny phones would be like stealing our oxygen and water supply. On behalf of the entire student body, I plead for us to be allowed to use our phones during lunch and free time. Cell phones are a fun, portable way to keep us entertained, look up information, and remain in touch with our friends and families.

After we've dotted the i's and crossed the t's on our homework, we teenagers take pleasure in the interesting games our phones supply. Many tedious days have been salvaged by the latest and greatest iphone apps. Not all of the apps on our phones are pointless, however. There are applications for interesting and educational activities. Just the other day I discovered an optical illusion app that showed me all sorts of fascinating illusions. Some apps bring out our creative sides with drawing pictures with our fingertips. Sometimes there are even digital versions of board games on phones, like Scrabble, the wonderful spelling game that increases our vocabulary.

Instead of having to hunt for information in mountains of text books, students can look up info for school related projects on the internet connections given to us on our fantastic phones. Our phones let us onto search engines that give us everything from translators to news about current events. This gets our work done faster and smoother, and the quality skyrockets. Now we can get all the facts we need for that one thousand word essay on volcanoes in a jiffy!

Life would be terribly dull and lonely if we didn't have the beloved company of our friends and families. Sometimes between school and drama club and soccer practice, it becomes difficult to spend quality time with the people of our lives. However, phones can send text messages to all of our buddies and we can call up our parents just to say hello. If phones were forbidden, we wouldn't be able to do this.

Banning the usage of our mobiles would not only devastate us, but also restrict us from people, entertainment, and the helpful internet. In today's society, not having our phones can have harmful effects. Please keep the pupils of this school best interests at heart and bestow upon us the gift of technology.

Sincerely,

An Electronic Enthusiast",0,persuade_corpus,,8
7C76BEC3CBE5,"From the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it describes many reasons about how venus is not safe, but once along time ago could've looked like earth. Venus also know as Earth's ""twin"" is very close to earth. Venus has very many reasons about why humans havent been on it in three decades. ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" which tells me exactly how dangerous it actually is.

""on the planet's surface tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" which is extremely difficult to survive on. Imagine people from Earth going up to a place with 800 degrees Farenheit, no-one would make it out alive. Venus which ""97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"" which to me as very deadly as well.

Having all this horrible enviroment, it ""would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" which in my opinion would kill anyone their. Despite how deadly Venus seems, scientist want to go visit it anyway because they believe humans and animals lived on it before. ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth""

Since astrounauts can't take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance is nearly impossible because of its conditions. Hovering in a ship above Venus is limited to ground level because you cannot seethat far. Also sense light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere.

From all about what i've learned i can tell that Venus is extremely difficult for any living thing. Since astrounauts haven't landed on Venus in three decades proves that its way far from safe. Being able to not get samples such as gas, rocks, or anything they will never be able to tell if humans lived on it long ago making me believe that Venus is beyond dangerous and should be avoided.

B067F0CBE15C,"Having students take courses during the summer to graduate in three years isn't a great idea. The reason why I think it isn't a great idea is, students might need more credit to graduate, some students have jobs during the summer and could feel stressed workng and going to school at the same time, and students like to take a year break off school.

First reason why I think it isn't a good idea is because, students might need more credit and need to take more classes. if they where to want to do it but didn't have enough credit they would have to double up there classes and doing that, can make them feel stresssed and pressured. Three years of high school isn't enough, in four years a student can join a club, play a sport and have regular classes and not feel over whelmed, and doing all that can make he/she look good when looking at what college to go to. But if a student wanted to do all that while having way to much classses could make them feel over whelmed.

Second reason why, students have jobs when they start high school. We all people like to have money in are pockets and students get there money by working during the summer. But how can a student have a job and go to school, it gives less time for the student to do his hobi which is working. In the summer a student wants to work to save up for a car or for college, it's the only time a student doesn't have to worry about school, they could just be focusing on saving up to go to a good college.

Last but not least, at the end of the school year students like to go ahead and go to college but some might want a break to make money or think about what they want to do or just want a break of school. Having a break gives you time to work full time somewhere and save up for something you need like, a car, a house, or money for colllege. It takes time for you to be successful in life which is why you should take things slow and not make yourself stressed and tired doing everything fast.

In conclusion, students who graduate in three years instead of four years, isn't a great idea. Students might need more credit to graduate, some might have jobs during the summer and if they where to take classes they could feel stressed, and some students like to take a year break from school and would want to be working making money for them to buy needs.",0,original_moth,Task: Write an essay discussing the cons of having students graduate from high school in three years rather than four.,0
CE7E3C75BAF8,"First impressions often form the basis for how a person is perceived and treated. However, over time, these first impressions can change when a person is presented with friendly relationships and support networks. When people are given the support they need to grow and develop, it can open up doors and help them to challenge their initial second-guessing of themselves. Through the right friendships and relationships, both parties come to know each other, understand each otherâs good and bad habits, and support each other in times of difficulty. It is also easier for people to improve their weaknesses and showcase their positive attributes when their relationships offer them a safe space to do so.

9a1529cf6953_04112023,"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read student emotions in the classroom could provide both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, it may help teachers understand how their students are processing new information on an individual level. If a teacher notices multiple students express frustration or confusion during a lesson, they could adjust their approach to improve clarity. This technology could also identify instances of bullying or distress that a teacher may otherwise miss, allowing them to intervene more quickly to support students. 

However, constant monitoring of student facial expressions via FACS technology could undermine trust in the classroom and discourage free expression. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their emotional responses are being analyzed, changing their natural behaviors. There are also risks around student privacy and data security. Detailed emotion readings collected over time could reveal sensitive personal information if accessed by outside parties. Students deserve control over private aspects of their experience at school without being subject to constant electronic surveillance of their feelings.

Overall, using FACS in limited ways with clear communication to students about its purpose and data privacy policies could provide some academic benefits. However, overuse or lack of appropriate safeguards could negatively impact student well-being and the relationships essential to learning. If implemented, facial tracking should respect student consent, privacy, and create as little disruption to the natural classroom dynamic as possible. More discussion is needed around how and whether this technology can enhance education without unintended costs to student development and trust in their education system.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,7
A1E4631053F4,"Dear Principal,

I think we should be allowed to bring our cell phones to school because they will be turned off in school periods, we should be able to use them during lunch periods and free time, and also during important events.

My first reason why we should be able to bring our cell phones to school because they will be turned off. They won't be a big distraction in class. Teachers wouldn't be able to tell if we had our cell phones or not because they would be turned off during class periods. either they would be turned off or on vibrate. So the teacher wouldn't notice if we did have our cell phones or not.

My second reason why we should have bring our cell phones to school is because when we do have lunch or free time at school we should be able to use them then but when lunch time and free periods are over we are going to put them up immediately. But while we are at lunch we should have time to text friends or catch up with others or the ones that weren't at school that day tell them what they missed or what they had to make up that day or the day they come back. We should also have our phones at school because what if we have an emergency and we have to call home to our parents and tell them.

Finally, my third reason why we should be able to bring our phones to school is because when we do have important events. Our cell phones would be turned off and wouldn't be a big mess up when it does go off they wouldn't have to stop and tell us to turn the phone off and tell us to leave cause the phone would already be turned off and wouldn't be a big mess up.

In my conclusion, these are my reasons why would should bring our phones to school because they would be off in class periods, we should be able to bring them during lunch periods and free time, and they would be turned off in important events. I mean children would bring their phones anyway if they wanted to or not. They think it's their phone they can bring it so the principal should let us bring them to school no matter if they are on or off. Students are able to bring their phones either if there on or off they could be silent or on vibrate it wouldn't matter to a student. So there for we should be able to bring our phones to school.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

You should join because you could be helping the lives of the lives of thousands of innocent people whose homes where destroyed in the wars. One of the interesting things of joining the program is that you can see a amazing sights from all around the world.

It is an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Helping these people you can get the benefit of going to China and Europe and their famous landmarks. If you go to Italy there is a chance you could ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy. When i was in Crete is saw an excavated castle. On your way to China you can marvel your eyes at the Panama Canal. If your not in the mood for sight seeing you can go downstairs with some of you co-workers and play some baseball,volleyball,fencing,boxing,reading,whittiling,and Table-tennis to help pass the time while on board.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me.

It opened up the world to me and was vey grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of peolple in other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me for along time.

9D9B85A82575,"As an eighth-grade student, I have learned the importance of making a good first impression. However, sometimes it can be difficult to change a negative first impression that has been made on someone. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the issue and come to a conclusion on whether it is possible to change a negative first impression.

On one hand, it is possible to change a negative first impression if the person making the impression is willing to put in the effort to make things right. For example, if someone accidentally spills a drink on someone else, they can apologize and offer to clean up the mess. This shows that they take responsibility for their actions and are willing to make things right. Additionally, if the person making the impression is genuinely apologetic and shows a genuine interest in making things better, it can go a long way in changing the negative first impression.

On the other hand, it may not always be possible to change a negative first impression. Sometimes, the person making the impression may not be willing to put in the effort to make things right. For example, if someone consistently behaves in a rude or disrespectful manner, it may be difficult to change their negative first impression. Additionally, some people may have preconceived notions or biases that cannot be changed, no matter how hard the person making the impression tries to change them.

In conclusion, while it is possible to change a negative first impression if the person making the impression is willing to put in the effort to make things right, it may not always be possible. It is important to remember that first impressions are not always accurate and can be changed over time. Ultimately, it is up to the person making the impression to be genuine, apologetic, and willing to make things right in order to change a negative first impression.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,4
E660157F81B4,"When seeking advice from multiple people, there are several methods that one can use. These methods include asking friends, family members, colleagues, or even strangers for their opinions. While seeking advice from multiple people can be helpful, it can also have its disadvantages. In this essay, we will discuss the benefits and disadvantages of seeking advice from multiple people.

One of the main benefits of seeking advice from multiple people is that it allows for a diverse range of perspectives. When seeking advice from friends and family members, one can get a more personalized view of the situation. Colleagues can provide insight into the professional aspects of the situation, while strangers can offer an unbiased perspective. By considering the opinions of multiple people, one can gain a better understanding of the situation and make a more informed decision.

Another benefit of seeking advice from multiple people is that it can help to reduce stress and anxiety. When facing a difficult decision, it can be overwhelming to try to figure it out on one's own. Seeking advice from multiple people can provide a sense of relief and validation that one is not alone in their struggles. Additionally, hearing different perspectives can help to alleviate stress and anxiety by providing a sense of clarity and perspective.

Despite the benefits of seeking advice from multiple people, there are also some disadvantages to consider. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be time-consuming. Seeking advice from multiple people can involve scheduling meetings, making phone calls, or sending emails. This can be especially challenging for busy individuals who may not have the time or energy to seek advice from multiple people.

Another disadvantage of seeking advice from multiple people is that it can be difficult to navigate conflicting opinions. When seeking advice from friends and family members, one may receive conflicting opinions that can be difficult to reconcile. Additionally, seeking advice from strangers can be risky, as their opinions may not necessarily be trustworthy or reliable.

In conclusion, seeking advice from multiple people can have both benefits and disadvantages. While it can provide a diverse range of perspectives and reduce stress and anxiety, it can also be time-consuming and difficult to navigate conflicting opinions. Ultimately, the decision to seek advice from multiple people should be based on the specific situation and the individual's needs and preferences.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,8
2EDC00346850,"Dear Principal,

Sports are a very important factor to many schools.

Many kids take sports for granted, and don't focus on their school work.

Our Principal is considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

I fully agree and support this idea.

Despite the fact that many students have a grade C or below average, this new policy would encourage students to do well in school so that they can participate in sports, more students in the school would have grades of B's and even A's, and the sports teams and activities would be smarter and more successful as a result.

Overall, a requirement of a B average to play sports would be beneficial to our school's community as a whole.

If a new rule is put into play requiring all students to have at least a B average to play sports, students with averages of C and below would be encouraged to bring their grade up.

For example, many of the athletes with averages below B would have a reason to bring their grade up, or else they won't be able to participate in the activity that they love.

All of the athletes would change their priorities so that school comes first.

This rule would encourage students to do better in school so that they can participate in the activities that they love.

They would have a goal of achieving a B average, and applying themselves to achieve that goal. Overall, a requirement of a B average to participate in sports and other activities would be logical to put into play because it encourages students to do well in school and bring their grades up.

From this new rule, more students would have A and B averages as a result.

With a requirement of a B average to participate in extracurricular activities, more students would have the goal of achieving a B average.

As a result, less students would be failing their courses do to lack of effort or time.

With more students with a higher average, the school would look better in terms of grades.

Now that their is a requirement of a B average to participate in sports, music, or another activity, the school would have much smarter students.

As a result, these students would be sent to better colleges.

This would make the school less known for its bad things, but more well-known for its high academic prestige.

This requirement would be the most reasonable choice because less students would be failing courses.

As a result of requiring a B average amongst students in order to participate in sports and other activities, the teams would be much smarter and more successful.

For example, the smarter students that earn a B average or even higher would use the knowledge that they learned in the classroom and apply it onto the field.

Instead of having sports teams that consisted of students who didn't make the right decisions and were failing out of their courses, the teams would consist of smart students who applied themselves to reach their goal of earning at least a B average in academics.

On the field, court, or rink, the sports team would be making much smarter plays, and ultimately becoming more successful.

The time has come to decide whether or not to make a requirement of a B average amongst students in order to participate in sports or other activities.

This requirement would be beneficial to our school's community because it would encourage students to do well in the classroom, more students would have a B or higher grade average, and the sports teams would be much smarter and more successful as a result.

So, Mr. Principal, go and make a requirement of a B or higher grade average in order to participate in sports or other activities!",0,persuade_corpus,,7

ADC46484D3B7,"Have you ever had to miss School? Whether you were sick, missed the bus, overslept, gotten injured, or you just couldnt make it to class. Whatever the reason missing class is not good and a lotÂ of students miss class often. When students miss class it can cause them to fall behind and miss important material that they might need for later classes or tests. Missing class also means that you will then have to make up everything you missed and that can cause a lotÂ of stress not only for students but for teachers as well. Distance learning will solve a variety of these problems and I believe that students will benefit greatly from it. By giving the students the opportunity to access the class online or by video conference you are helping students keep up with their school work, teaching them accountability and responsibility, and relieving stress on students.

Distance learning will help students to not fall behind on their work or in class. It is very easy to fall behind when you miss school it can make students feel lost,confused, and unprepared. When students are absent they are likely to have to come in early, stay late,and schedule appointments with teachers. They are also forced to work around their teacher schedules as well as their own. Getting behind on work can be really frustrating it can make students feel overwhelmed and unmotivated. But if the materials they learned in class that day are made available at home it solves the problem. Then students won't have to worry about not getting the work or missing the class because it is available online and they have access to it so, they wouldnt have any reason to fall behind.

Making the classes available at home benefits students and teachers by holding students accountable for the work as well as teaching them responsibility. Students will no longer be able to miss class and not be held responsible for the work because they have access to the material at home. This will hold students more accountable because there are no excuses and no reason to not do the work because they are no longer missing the class even if they are not there. Teachers will also be able to hold the students more accountable because even if they are absent they still have the tools to complete the work, but without the teacher physically being there the responsibility lies on the student. This will also help students not feel like they have all the responsibility without the proper materials and they will be able to do the work on time and not miss anything.

Lastly, distance learning will relieve students of stress and help them to not be as worried about missing class. Being a student is very stressful and as a student there are a lotÂ of things that you are responsible for and or feel obligated to do. Keeping up with the work load is a big job and a job most students struggle with. Students have a hard time maintaining a balance and tend to become very stressed. Missing class is very stressful because when a student misses a class they then have to deal with all the things that go into trying to make up the work that they missed. If a student misses more than one class it is very easy for them to become overwhelmed and stressed. But with distance learning you are eliminating the stress of missing class because students will still be able to do the work. Therefore, you are relieving the stress.

Although some people may argue, distance learning is a great tool and something that all students could benefit from greatly. It makes life easier for not only students but everyone in the school program. It helps students keep up with the work, it promotes responsibility and holds students accountable, and makes life less stressful for students. Making classes available for students online is a great idea and i think all students should have the privilege of having distance learning.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
E52C094A1DAA,"Attitude is perhaps one of the most important traits when it comes to success in life. People with a positive attitude approach situations with optimism and enthusiasm, which in turn leads to better outcomes. This is just as true in the workplace as it is in life. Having a good attitude can connect people to more opportunities and give them the confidence to excel.

Having a good attitude also helps with problem solving. People who have a positive outlook are more likely to stay focused on the solutions, rather than getting fixed on the problems. This mindset can help them come to better and more realistic solutions.

Moreover, having a good attitude can reduce stress and maximize happiness. People with a positive attitude can better handle the inevitable challenges that life will bring, creating a more fulfilling and rewarding life.

D0CC47FFC293,"Having a positive attitude is essential to success in life. It impacts not only how we interact with those around us, but how we perceive and overcome obstacles. A positive attitude allows us to approach every situation with optimism, rather than fear or pessimism, and this can make a significant difference in our lives. 

First, having a positive attitude can help us form better relationships with other people. When we view interactions with others in a positive light, we are more likely to understand their point of view and approach them with empathy and kindness. In contrast, a negative attitude can lead to conflict and further alienation from those we care about.

Second, having a positive attitude can help us to approach problems in a constructive way. Rather than wallowing in self-doubt or giving up when faced with difficulty, a positive attitude encourages us to have faith in our own abilities and take action. A positive outlook enables us to realize that failure is not always the end of the story, and that often it is possible to learn and grow even in the face of adversity.

Third, there is a big difference between positive and negative attitudes. A negative attitude causes us to focus on only the bad aspects of a situation, whereas a positive attitude allows us to see the potential for good even in the most challenging circumstances. This in turn can make it easier to find solutions to difficult problems rather than viewing them as insurmountable challenges.

Lastly, having a positive attitude can help us to achieve our goals and be happier overall. When we approach life with a positive attitude, we start with the premise that we can achieve our goals and strive for success. We also open ourselves up to all of the potential for joy life has to offer, which can lead to a feeling of greater wellbeing.

In conclusion, a positive attitude is essential to success in life. It affects our relationships, how we view and solve problems, and the likelihood of achieving our goals. Being positive leads to a happier, more fulfilled life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: 

Write an essay on why having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Consider the following points: 

- How a positive attitude affects relationships with other people 
- How it helps solve problems 
- The difference between positive and negative attitudes 
- How having a positive attitude makes you more likely to achieve your goals and be happier.",5
18113556C5DC,"First off , In my opinion I think that there is no face on the moon. Some of NASA believe that some aliens made the face on the moon years ago. I believe that there is no face and that is beacuse there are no aliens. If there is a face on the moon it was probably made by an astroid or a meteorid that crashed there a few years ago and it was just now starting to form more into a face. If it were aliens who created the face on the moon, why didn't they come back time after time so the humans could see them. Honestly, who is there to blame for this mysterious face on the moon? Many people may ask, what should we do to figure out if there is a face or not. Well in my opinion, I think we should have NASA send someone or some people to the moon and see whats really going on. NASA also doesn't have evidence that there are aliens that did it. They just assume that there are aliens basically. Maybe there is really no face on the moon. I really think that maybe NASA should either just let this go or they should just send someone to space to chck it out. I just don't like how NASA has no evidence that there are asliens who made the face. I think maybe NASA should just go check it out for themselves.

Second, 25 years ago when Viking 1 snapped a photo of the face on the moon, it didn't really look all that good. Even when they took the photo from 1998 and 2001 the pictures still didn't look as nice as they should. People could always just snap a picture and rearrange things in the photo and then make it seem like there is an object there when there really isn't anything there. In the paragraph it even say's ""new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NAA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" That could possibly mean that when they were looking at photos they could have saw something else but rearranged the photo to see another thing that they didn't see but they wanted the world to belive them that a face wa on the moon. That is my opinion on if there is a face on the moon.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
89E8673AC25E,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains that studying Venus is a worthy approach despite the dangers. The author impressively supports that the mission to Venus is worth it despite the dangers that might come with it. In the article he provides examples, uses a credible source, and also views the other side. By doing these things it made his point credible and also stronger to the reader.

In the article he provides the example of a floating car above venus to show that a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the conditions but it would provide little sight. He uses to example to illustrate what it would be like to avoid the conditionsby showing this is what the would have to do. He also provides examples to an alternative by saying that there could be electronics to avoid the risks. By providing both of these examples it gives the reader some relateable examples to get an insight into his point.

NASA is a world wide administration that has credibility over the course of its govern. By providing examples of what NASA is doing to show that it should be done, then if NASA is working on it then it makes his point credible. He quotes NASA'S approches on studying Venus so that it can avoid the risks to show that it is possible to explore Venus without the risks. A NASA solution would be that a person could float above the fray. They also have considered sending electronices so it is possible. He saying that it might be difficult but it is attainable. This supports the claim that he supports his claim impresively because he uses sources.

In most arguments the person views the other side so that they can provide an alternative to what they are saying. He uses cons such as no mission has had a man, 97% of carbon dioxide blankets Venus, the temperature is 90 times greater than Earth, and that it could crash a submarine. But then he says that Venus has benefits to that out way the dangers. The benfits include: it is the brightest point, it is close to Earth compared to other space travels, long ago it could support life, and it will expand the edges of imagination and innovation. He provides benefits to out weigh the cons of exploring Venus. He does a great job of explaining why exploring Venus has value and can provides insight to other counter arguments that might rise from others opionions. This is why he does an impressive job supporting his argument.

In conclusion, the author provided points in the argument to make the opinion more credible and also stronger to the reader. In the article the author provided examples, a wide known credible source, and viewed the other side. He impressively supported his opinon that the mission to Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. Without his evidence to suppport his opinion the article would have not had such an impact on the reader. This is why he did an impressive job supporting his idea.     ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
2C24880113A2,"School is not always about learning in one specific building. It can be anywhere you wish, if you do only schooling. So many students deal with anxiety and that affects their grades. Working from home will give them a relaxing, comfortable space. When someone is familiar with a place they tend to focus easier. In a school building there are a lot of distractions, which takes focus away from a student's work. Not being at school can also be the leading issue for some students to fail classes. If they had an option to work at home it could save plenty of students and their grades. There are many benefits to working at home on school, but here are just a few.

Anxiety is an issue plenty of students suffer from in their day to day lives. It can cause students to focus on trivial things, like their clothes, makeup, hair, and handwriting. When the student woks from home it will help keep them from stressing over the little things. It would help them from over thinkingÂ on small issues that will not greatly impact the student. A form of anxiety is social anxiety, which is the fear of being social. Online school will help the student from worrying over socializing with their fellow peers.

Comfort is an important part of a students' life and mental health. School is stressful; with all the hustling of people. Online school would help the student to work in a place that they are familiar and feel safe in. They can choose the place that they work in. The feeling of control, from the fact that they choose where they work and what they work on, will give the student a relaxing and stress free environment. The relaxing will help the student to focus on their work and not get bad grades. A comfortable and relaxing enviremont is essential to some students.

When in a classroom there is a lot of commotion that goes on around the school. The distraction range from someone digging in their backpack to students screaming in the hallways. To certain students they can't just sit still and work. If they work at home it may help them from failing their classes. In an actual school you have field trips that you have to attend or drills that you must follow through with. These distractions take away from valuable class time.

Getting injured or sick is all a part of life. Plenty of students get sick and have to stay in the hospital and miss a lot of class time. The teachers will sometimes have work be sent to the student, but that doesn't give them what was taught. Online school would give them the chance of continuing their work and not fail. Some students get injured and need surgery. The issue with surgery is that majority of the time along recovery period is needed. The teachers will also have work be sent to them, but still won't help them a lot. Missing long period of school is not just associated with bad health, but can be from vacationing or moving a lot. Some students have parents who like to vacation fro long periods of times. The students loose important class time and it has a risk of them failing high school. Online school could help them stay on vacation, but have the chance to graduate. There are plenty of jobs that require a person to move a lot and sometimes the parents drag their kids along. The kids will have to continue to switch schools and they miss a lot of work and fall behind. Online school would make it be to where they don't miss school time.

In summary online school should always be offered. The reasons a student may have to online school will change, but they are valid and important reasons. The student who has anxiety can relax and pass their classes. The kids who is uncomfortable in a school environment can have a safe and familiar spot to learn in. The students who can never focus can have a distraction free place to learn. The students who are missing majority of the school year can now learn without the fear of failure. There are so many benefits behind online schooling.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
CFCB45ABFDA6,"Summer break is that time of the year where students are fresh out of school. They immediately start what has been planned prior to their break starting, but always forget one thing which is the information that they have been taught. Summer projects happen in some schools, but these projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects allow for students to work in many ways to gain information and students can limit themselves as to how much they want to learn.

There are many ways a student can learn information. An example of this is a site called KhanAcademy which can be used to learn any subject. This site has a lot of information that can be learned, especially when it comes to the people who struggle in math and they can visualize what is being shown through an instructional video on how to do things. Another way to learn during the summer is by reading books and articles online or at a local library. Elementary schoolers to this day still read over the summer and keep track with their reading log in order to improve their reading skills, but some schools offer rewards for learning over summer break. Having a student design their own project can allow them to use as many resouces as they want like each other. A family member, friend, or associate can teach them something they don't know or have struggled on.

Students should be able to limit themselves when trying to learn something new or old, if they do not understand it. Allowing students to do this can help them out on knowing how to prioritze and can help them to become a self starter without needing guidance from a teacher. Some people feel the need to learn more than they do in school because what has been learned can be useful in their daily lives. For example, using the skills learned in a family and consumer science class can be used out in the real world such as how to shop for groceries, take care of clothing, etc. Learning more can essientially make things in life easier while being in and out of school. Information like this can be shared with one another in order for their lives to be easier as well.

Although, student-designed summer projects can show how creative and organized a student can be, not all students are capable of wanting to learn over the summer because they are not motivated enough to do so. They would rather focus on what fun they will be doing during the summer because they feel like enough has been learned throughout the school year. Some students will continue to procrastinate on designing their own project that would be given before the break even starts.

Being able to come back to school next year will be less stressful without trying to remember things that have been forgotten about over a certain period of time. It is always best to stay up-to-date with all the things that are taught. It also feels nice to carry around knowledge known to themselves, but not to others. Students may be updated with their knowledge to the point where they might show their teachers a few things. This is why summer projects should be student-designed.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
CD8F95C18776,"To whomever it may concern,

The process of the Electoral College has been a problem for many years and deserves to be abolished at its roots. The Electoral College should not be kept due to the fact that not many Americans comprehend this legal process, swing vote catastrophies and other problems, and its lack of democratic pedigree. You may wonder why someone like me is even writing about this or why I even care, but I care about what happens in my country's economy and government, and others should too.

First thing's first: knowledge. From personal experiences and research, you may realize that the majority of Americans in 2014 couldn't describe to you what the process of the Electoral College even is. Each state is different in this process, just like each opinion is different about this topic. This is an immensely confusing subject to read about, especially when you're just an average person watching the news or reading an article online. Although, let's be real for a minute: its really difficult. The process consists of selecting the electors, and the meeting of the electors where they vote for our President and Vice President. Also, in school curriculum across the country, you never really go into depth about the Electoral College unless you're taking a hardcore government class. In this case, the students are yet to be informed about the causes and effects of the Electoral College and the disasters it can cause in our economy.

Let's continue, shall we? The swing vote catastrophies, the worrying about who will be elected and whether or not they'll do a good job controlling our government, it's just not worth it. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election rather than the system that we use now. When citizens vote, they're basically voting for slates of electors, who then eventually vote to elect the President as well as the Vice President. The question is: Who are the electors? Who picks them? Are they responsible with the task at hand? The fact of the matter is that you really have no control over who the electors vote for. A ""faithless"" elector can vote for whomever they please, even if it isn't their party's candidate. This process is extremely unfair to voters across the country, and I doubt the phrase ""Life isn't fair"", a quote by my grandmother, would even apply to this discussion.

As previously stated, the process of the Electoral College isn't the greatest of them all, nor is it fair to voters. I asked who the electors were, and who picks them... but where is the abundant democratic pedigree? To remind you, a democratic pedigree is the origin and history of something, especially when it is good or impressive to others. The Electoral College is outdated and irrational for our modern day concepts. This extensive process lacks alot of opinions, evidence, and background knowledge that is necessary when voting for candidates. On the other hand, there is usually a certainty of outcome in the election, and it avoids run-off elections which is pleasant to citizens who are for the Electoral College. What about the swing votes? What about the values?

To wrap things up, the Electoral College is not needed in the United States government because of lack of understanding, disasters that may be caused, and the democratic pedigree and honesty that is nowhere to be found. I hope you consider my decisions and grow very fond of my reasonings.

With great appreciation,

llama_70b_v1494,"I somewhat agree with the principal's decision to require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. This decision can have numerous benefits for students. For instance, participating in sports can help students develop physical fitness, teamwork skills, and discipline. Working on the yearbook or serving on the student council can provide opportunities for students to develop their leadership, communication, and organizational skills.

Moreover, extracurricular activities can also help students explore their interests and passions outside of academics. For example, a student who is interested in photography can join the yearbook club and learn more about photography while also contributing to the creation of a memorable yearbook. Similarly, a student who is interested in politics can join the student council and learn more about leadership, governance, and decision-making.

Furthermore, participating in extracurricular activities can also help students make new friends and build a sense of community. For instance, a student who joins a sports team can develop camaraderie with their teammates and learn to work together towards a common goal.

However, I also understand that some students may have concerns about participating in extracurricular activities. For example, some students may feel that they do not have enough time to participate in extracurricular activities due to their academic workload or other responsibilities. In this case, the school could provide flexible options for students, such as allowing them to participate in extracurricular activities during lunch breaks or after school.

In conclusion, while I agree with the principal's decision to require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I also acknowledge that the school should provide flexible options for students who may have concerns about participating in these activities. By participating in extracurricular activities, students can develop valuable skills, explore their interests, and build a sense of community.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

dfb68b55,"To many, it is a necessity. To others, its a waste of money. Cars have been a growing industry ever since the ModelT, but over the last few years automobiles may soon start to look like a thing of the past. There have been many efforts to reduce car use because it is better for the environment, creates a more social atmosphere, and the best of all it is cheaper.

Could you imagine major streets, cities, and highways almost deserted of those four wheeled gas guzzlers? Well annualy in Bogota, Columbia citizens participate, or for many ""celebrate"" no car day. Other forms of transportation such as skating, biking, or walking are very common as violaters of no car day face twenty five dollar fines. Many enjoy the holiday like Carlos Plaza, who rode his twoseat bike to work with his wife. It is a day to be socializing with others, not locked up in your vehicle but to get out and enjoy the fresh air before it is all polluted and blown out the exhaust. The day alone has caused a blooming of parks, and restraints throughout the city. With less drivers out on the road, this day is traffic free and extremely safe as well. This is not only a common trend in Colombia, but is beginning to be seen in the United States as well. Teens have begun using their summerlife to being in carpools or riding the bus to not only get around environmentally, but to also meet and be with friends and develop a more social community. This can be seen through carpooling apps and cell phones to arrange other forms of transportation.

Over the years there has been a push to use more ecofriendly cars such as hybrids, or electric cars. But what about not driving a car at all? Many have made this change in Vauban, Germany where residents of this upperclass community have gone motor free, and given up cars. This suburban area alone is a huge effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, similar to citizens in paris who have lost their driving privileges due to the extreme amount of smog in their city. By banning odd numbered plates from driving on monday, and even numbered plates from driving on tuesday, pedestrians hopped on trams and bicycles to commute the rest of their day. Each time you firie up your engine, carbon monoxide and other pollution gas is released into the atmosphere, causing a widening hole in the ozone layer affecting Global Warming. In this twoday restriction, smog was significantly reduced throughout the city.

Many gimmance and frown as they fill up their gas tank, knowing they just spent forty dollars on gasoline, and will be right back at the same pump next week. Money makes the world go around, and spending less on cars, highways and other expenses could brighten anyones day. It is absolutely free to get to work on a bicycle, and New Yorks bike sharing program has significantly jumped inthe last few years as many would rather use manpower than horsepower to travel. Not just bikes but other services are cheaper as well like taking the bus, the few dollars for a bus pass or a train ticket is much less than a new toyota. The infamous no car day in Colombia has influenced money to be spent on wide, and smooth sidewalks for bikers instead of million dollar highways. Due to the recession, many are not buying cars or getting their license simply because they dont have the resources to afford one. Some believe the idea of a personal car is impractical says Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company. Bill believes it is best to use the comercial network of transportation for its lower cost, eco friendly, and a safer environment on the road.

Since the beginning of man all forms of transportation have been used, but are cars starting to become a thing of the past? On paper, the idea of not owning personal cars looks great. The environment would improve significantly, daily interactions with comuting to work develops a more social enviroment, and is of course cost reductive.

DB8F7B150495,"Curfews are a useful and often necessary tool to help keep teenagers out of trouble. They provide an invaluable element of safety for teens of all ages, allowing parents to better ensure their children come home safe and on time. However, curfews can also be seen as unfairly limiting the lives of young people, limiting or prohibiting their access to certain crucial social activities or experiences. 

On one hand, a strict curfew enforced in a household can be beneficial in many ways. It allows parents to have a sense of control over their children and can help to keep them out of situations that could be unhealthy or even dangerous. It also provides a space for teenagers to all have the same level of respect for safety and responsibility that can help to lower the risk of involvement in criminal activities. 

On the other hand, curfews can also be restrictive for young people, limiting their ability to make their own decisions and explore the world around them. Some teens may feel overprotected or limited in their access to certain places or experiences. Parents should be mindful of their childrenâs needs and try to provide a balance between safety and freedom. 

Overall, curfews are necessary to ensure the safety of teenagers in many households. However, they should also be used thoughtfully. Parents should be certain to provide their children with enough freedom to explore and find their own identity, while still keeping the lines of communication and trust open at all times.

A1A778253D39,"This new found technology is outstanding and can do marvellous things, however, it is not needed for students in the classroom.

I feel that it would not be as beneficial to students as the author makes it sound. At some point this technology may be helpful for counselors of schools but it is not for daily classroom use.

I am not saying that this technology is not an innovation. It is a tremendous breakthrough to the world of technology. And it could be beneficial to some professions and aspects of life, like psychology, but it just does not apply to students in the same way. The author says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"".

This is not true.

The only way that this could be true is if we replaced human teachers with computers, and that, i think, is a huge step in the wrong direction.

Technology is helpful to the world but to much of it may be a problem that is irreversable.

Furthermore, I think that this technology could be very helpful to high school counselors. With the emotional reader the counselors will be able to identify cases of depression or anxiety or other mental disorders found in high school easier.

In the article it states, ""we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day"". This is referring to the calculating the computer does. It says that we do that to which is true but we are not nearly as precise or efficient. That is why we need this technology or something like it for counselors, to lighten their burdens, but to also ensure that their job gets done.

Finally, I believe that the installation of emotionally sensing computers to every classroom would be a mistake. However, putting them in the hands of counselors would be brilliant. I think that the world should look into this technology more and decide the best uses for it. ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
B9BA0955819D,"Hey there!  So, you wanna know how older students can help younger students with their school work?  Well, let me tell you, it's like this - older students can be superheroes for their younger counterparts! 

First of all, older students can teach younger students teamwork.  Like, think about it, younger students might not know how to work with others, but older students do! They can show them how to collaborate, communicate, and compromise.  It's like, if you're playing a game with someone younger than you, you can teach them how to be a good team player, right? 

And, older students can also teach younger students new things!  Like, if you're really good at math, you can help your younger sibling or friend with their math homework.  Or, if you're into reading, you can read a book with them and help them understand it better.  It's like, sharing your knowledge with someone else is awesome, and it makes you feel good too! 

But, the best part is, older students can also learn from younger students!  Like, younger students might have fresh ideas or perspectives that older students haven't thought of before.  And, older students can learn how to be more patient and understanding.  It's like, if you're working on a project with someone younger than you, you can learn how to be more patient and help them through the process.

The reason why I am for it is because"" the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles."" The second reason is because ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen,a similar ad might follow. But if you frown,the next ad will be different."" This proves that the ads will change because of your face expresstion.

I feel like this is a good way to know other peoples face expresstion so that way if you don't know if your friend or family member is mad,sad,happy,surprise,etc. Then they can use the Facial Action Coding Stystem so it will tell you if they are okay or not and if they need to talk to you than they can. Its also a great way for them to tell the difference between different expresstion. So when they get older they can know exactly what face expresstion they are using.

44E343ECD9B7,"""What's the matter bud?"" Thomas says to his best friend, Charlie, as he doesn't carry his huge smile today as usual.

""Oh it's nothing."" replies Charlie who's obviously not as happy as he always is. Thomas would sure like to know how is friend is feeling; but he can't because there's no humanly way possible to if Charlie doesn't want him to know right? Well actually he can. There's a new kind of technology called Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable. Like in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, it could be used to show when a kid is becoming bored and let the teacher know so that the instructor could switch the lesson up to grab the kid's attention. Another effective was it could be used would be for it to show how some kids are feeling to limit them getting into any kinds of trouble. And finally it could be used to detect if one student just isn't grasping the matter of the subject that everyone else is getting with no problem. There are endless ways this technology could be used to better a classroom and this technology should be used in a classroom with students.

In the article, Nick D'Alto used a quote from Dr. Huang which was ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" In the sense that kids often time get bored in class, hence the reason they have a bad grade or get in trouble in that class, something has to change. Maybe it's the child's fault, but your traditional lesson isn't the most fun. If the instructor could find out what's boring the child and change the lesson to keep the child entertained then maybe the child wouldn't get into so much trouble with that teacher or maybe the child's grade in the class would take a huge leap. Who says learning can't be fun? With FACS learning could be something kids like to do.

In addition to keeping everyone awake, FACS could be used to keep people who aren't feeling too good get better. Everyone deals with things that others probably don't know about. With FACS a student could come into class like Charlie and no one knows about his frustrations so they try to do their normal jokes and games with him. If a student ever comes into class not feeling the best or not wanting to be bothered, FACS could sense that and instead of people messing with that kid or having that kid be bothered, that child could have the option of being away from everyone while the child cools down. That could stop the child from being involved in a physical altercation or any altercations at that.

Finally, everyone knows that all children learn at their own speed. FACS could be used to find out whose stuck on someting that everyone is flying through.

When the teacher is teaching something that everyone but one student understands and the teacher stops for questions, that one student may feel too embarrassed to ask a question so the lesson would go on and only get more difficult as time goes by. Instead of that happening, FACS would let the teacher know what kid that is so that the teacher could reach out to the kid and give them extra practice or even a little tutoring if they need it, that could really be a huge help to children that don't learn as fast as others. Usong FACS to determine that could really translate for the great or good of the grades of students everywhere.

In order to make the classroom a more happy place, a better place, FACS should be used with students. FACS could detect bordem so that no kid is bored enough to drift into space or sleep and miss valuable work time. FACS would be good for keeping kids that are dealing with things away from people that'll trigger them. Also FACS can be used to show weather or not children have questions and need help but are embarrassed to say so. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
D37E97BD69F4,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I truly agree with your idea to change the school policy of not allowing students with a C Average or lower to participate in sports. I think that this would greatly improve our schools grades because many of the students whom enjoy playing sports but have low grades will be encouraged and determined to bring their grades up so they can play. Also, they would use the same stamina they had for sports and put it towards their grades, and once they pull that grade up from a C or D to a B or an A they'll see how easy it was to get a good grade, that they'll just keep up the hard work. Which would in the end not only raise their average, but the school's as well, because we as students represent the school, and having a school full of jock's that don't have good grades, doesn't reflect well on the school as a whole.

Also, I believe that being allowed to play sports is a reward. I think students should earn the right to play on the schools sport teams, because then that way they'll learn what it feels like to earn something that they truly care for. Having the students earn the right to play on the sports team is also very important because not only would they learn how to value it, because many people take for granted what they have. They'll also learn how the real world is because you don't always get everything handed to you in a silver platter.

Another thing would be that it wouldn't be considered fair to other students how have A' s and B' s to be working very hard to maintain their grades, while students with C' s, D' s, and F' s without a care in the world are playing sports, and being the MVP, and All-Star player of the school's sports teams. And players who have smarts, and are good at playing always have a better advantage, because those are the students that get picked to play on big college teams.

The students also need to learn that there should be a balance of both academics, and sports, because you might be really good at sports but that isn't going to get you very far. You need to have a proper and good education if you want to make it big, because not all football players become famous, and if they do, it usually doesn't last too long. This is gravely important because many students now a days don't care about academic success, they think that by becoming a professional baseball player, or football player, that their life will be perfect, and that's why they stop trying in school, and by changing the policy more students will become more encouraged, and improve their grades.

Sincerely,

B7B7115CD3A4,"I think students should not be allowed to use their phones in school at all because it is to much of a distraction towards that student and everyone else. It wouldn't matter if they could use it during snack or lunch because they are already with their friends during their free times. Letting them use it during snack and lunch will tempt the kids to use it during their periods. The cell phones will distract themselves and their class mates.

When a student uses their phone during class, they are not paying attention to the teacher but only to the text message and will only get half or less of the entire lesson. They would not understand the lesson or might not even remember what the teacher just said. Their grades will drop and the students around him or her will get distracted and might not pay attention to the teacher either. If phones were allowed at school, it might make more trouble then without it. If a student sees their classmate or student next to them use their cell phones during class, that student too will try or at least think about using their phones during class. If this happens too many phones will be taken to the office.

If students were allowed to use their phones during snack or lunch, they would not use it as much because they are already with their friends and their won't be a need to use their phones. If they might not use it during their free time, why allow it at all. Letting the kids use their phones during snack and lunch might tempt the kids to be using their phones during class even more then not allowing them to use their phones at school at all. Changing the rules to make kids use their phones during snack and lunch won't help the kids but make them distracted even more. Problems with phones might happen more often then normal and the parents might not like the idea of letting their kids use their phones during school hours. I think the parents will complain which will make a lot of arguments happen.

I believe that students should not be able to use their phones during school. If students were allowed to have their phones, it will make to much trouble between the teachers and the students. Too many phones will be taken away to the office and it will make a lot of trouble. This is why I believe that students should not be able to use their phones during school even if its snack or lunch.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

CC9E2835EFAF,"Teamwork is a crucial aspect of society that has been recognized for centuries. Teamwork is the process of working together with others to achieve a common goal. It involves collaboration, cooperation, and communication among team members. The importance of teamwork cannot be overstated, as it plays a vital role in achieving success in various aspects of life.

One of the most significant benefits of teamwork is the prevention of overwork among team members. When individuals work together, they can divide tasks based on their strengths and expertise, ensuring that each team member is working at their optimal level. This approach helps to prevent burnout and fatigue, as individuals are not overworked or overwhelmed with tasks that they may not be equipped to handle.

Effective teamwork is evident in various aspects of society. For example, in sports, teamwork is essential for success. Players must work together to pass the ball, defend against the opposing team, and score goals. Similarly, in business, teamwork is vital for success. Companies that work together as a team are more likely to achieve their goals and are more productive than those that do not.

Communication is also essential to ensure team success. Effective communication allows team members to share ideas, express concerns, and collaborate on tasks. When team members communicate effectively, they can work together seamlessly, resulting in better outcomes.

Government projects and kitchen workflows also rely heavily on teamwork. For example, in construction projects, teamwork is critical to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget. Similarly, in the kitchen, teamwork is essential to ensure that food is prepared and served efficiently and effectively.

The implications of not having teamwork can be severe. Without teamwork, individuals may struggle to achieve their goals, and organizations may suffer from decreased productivity and efficiency. Furthermore, teamwork helps to build trust and foster a sense of community, which is essential for personal and professional growth.

In conclusion, teamwork is a vital aspect of society that has numerous benefits. Teamwork prevents overwork among team members, ensures effective communication, and is essential for achieving success in various aspects of life. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize teamwork and encourage collaboration and cooperation among individuals and organizations.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,9

3A6713466873,"Cars are a convience to people worldwide. We use them to go to work, school and many more places on a daily basis. Even within walking distance, many still choose to take their car out of laziness. Is this how we should really live?

In an upscale community in Germany called Vauban, the streets are completely ""car-free"". Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this new district. Though car ownership is still legal, places to park are very limited. Only 70% of Vauban's families don't own cars. 57% sold a car to move there. ""When I had a carÂ  I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. (3) Vauban, home to 5,500 residents withtin a rectangular square milem may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life.

Paris has also done something similar to better the lives of their citizens. Paris, France's capital city has banned driving due to smog. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. Paris has a strict schedule on when you can drive if you really have to. On Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-Euro. 22 Euros is equivilant to $31 in U.S currency. This ban has led to almost 4,000 drivers being fined. (12) And 27 people had their cars impounded due to their reaction to the fine. The amount of smog before this ban was applied was 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter. This is a significantly high difference in the amount of smog compared to Brussels with 114 micrograms and only 79.7 in London. Although, the ban has helped clear this smog, enough on Mondays to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

Vauban and Paris both have very excellent results in their experiments due to the changes in their environment with cars. Maybe more cities in the near future will join in on this ban against cars. Instead of driving your car to the nearest pharmacy to pick up some things, take a walk to save gas and to get some fresh air. Maybe this ban isn't for everyone, but even trying to limit car usage to minimal can help the environment. Instead of driving your car to the nearest pharmacy to pick up a few things, try walking there. You'll get some well needed excercise and fresh air.

B0AD7021AB07,"Kobe Bryant is known for his signature jump shot, the Fade-away. It's unique, it's effective, and it's his style. In the classroom, every student dreads the word ""project"". Projects are meant to test comprehension on a given topic. The problem with teacher-designed projects is that they are boring and predictable. The teacher-designed projects also have specific guidelines, which doesn't allow students to expand their thinking and express their knowledge in a way they would like to. Summer school projects should be student-designed because it allows students to show their own creativity, the students would put in effort with something they are passionate about, and teacher-led projects are too basic.

Lamar Jackson and LeBron James strive in their respective sports for one reason, their style. If every athlete were to shoot the basketball the same way, or throw the football the same way, then there would be no point in watching the games! These sporting events are exciting because every athlete has their own style of play. The same could be said in the classroom. If every student in a class presented a slide showÂ or an essay for their project, I bet the teacher would fall asleep in an instant! Student-designed projects gives the opportunity for the students to really show their creativity and understanding in a way that is special to them. For example, a student who has musical talent could write a song about their project, or an athlete could make a game for their project. The options are endless! The purpose of a project is to test the students' knowledge on a given subject, so why not let them do it their way?

Imagine sitting through a class where every single student presented with a slide show; It's so simple that a baby could make the same project. Teacher-designed projects don't give the opportunity for students to really show how well they understand the topic. Repetition in the classroom is very toxic. Having the same boring project guideline for every student doesn't engage the students in any way at all. The student-designed projects show diversity and creativity; on the other hand, teacher-designed projects are extremely dull and unoriginal. The teacher-designed projects have such a strict rubric that makes the students roll their eyes. The biggest flaw of it all is that the students are only trying to satisfy the teacher, rather than trying to fully comprehend the subject.

When someone is passionate about anything, they give it their all. When I'm on the lacrosse field, I give my 100% every time I step on the turf. Passion in life forces the best result in any moment. If students were able to lead their own project, then an astonishing grade would be guaranteed. Kobe Bryant is one of the basketball players because of his passion for the game and the amount of work he puts in to get better. In the classroom, students would put in a tremendousÂ amount of effort if they were given the chance to do a project in their own way. Whenever I get a project assigned, I tell myself that I will start working on it the next day. If I were able to put my own twist on a project, I might be able to finish the whole assignment in one day!

The way Carlos Santana strums a guitar is iconic and infamous; no other living creature can imitate his style. In the classroom, an assignment is ruined when the students don't get to show their creativity and way of thinking. Teacher-designed projects make students think inside the box, and they are trapped with a specific set of rules that they cannot pass. Projects are meant to test the student on their knowledge on the subject, but most students only do the project for a passing grade and not for their own comprehension. Summer school projects should be student-designed because the students are able to form something in their own style, they would put in effort into something they are passionate about, and the teacher-designed projects are plain and disgusting. A teacher-designed project is a vanilla ice cream cone, while a student-designed project is an ice cream cone with nuts, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
ACE1BE41A8E0," In his famous quote, Thomas Jefferson emphasizes the importance of constant activity and productivity. He believes that we can achieve great things if we are always doing something, even if it's small. I agree with Jefferson's sentiment that we accomplish more when we are always doing something, and I believe that this principle applies to all aspects of life.

In my own experience, I have found that practicing regularly is key to achieving my goals. Whether it's building a house, learning a new skill, or working towards a personal dream, consistent effort is what ultimately leads to success. For example, when I was learning to play soccer, I found that the more I practiced, the better I became. I would spend hours every day training and improving my skills, and over time, I saw a significant improvement in my performance.

Similarly, when it comes to building a house, I have found that taking small steps every day can make a big difference. Whether it's putting up a wall, laying a foundation, or framing a door, each small action contributes to the larger project. By breaking down the project into manageable tasks and working on them consistently, I have been able to build a strong and sturdy home.

In addition to personal goals, I believe that the principle of constant activity applies to societal issues as well. One of the most pressing issues facing our world today is racism, and I believe that we can make significant progress in ending it by taking small steps every day. Whether it's speaking out against discrimination, educating ourselves and others about the issue, or working towards policy changes, consistent effort can make a big difference.

534353848265,"When children think about summer they normally think about all fun and no work. Although some schools make it mandatory for a summer project so the students do not forget everything they have learned. The only dilemma with this is who should come up with the assignment at hand. Students and teachers alike think they are the correct person to do this but the logical way to do this is for the teachers to design the assignment. By the teacher assigning the project it will help insure that the assignment will help the students learn, retain, and experience the information that will be or has been taught in the classroom.

First off, by having the teacher make the assignment it makes it easier on the students and their learning throughout the summer. The teacher knows exactly what the students need to learn or at least be introduced to by the beginning of the next school year. By having the teachers design the projects the students will learn all the materials needed for the next year as well as learn new materials that will be introduced. Staying on topic to the things the students have learned or will learn will increase the understanding and overall success in the classroom for the following year. It also insures that the students will actually learn something through the summer rather than sitting at home forgetting everything they had just learned. Another reason for the teachers to be in favor of designing the project would be that different subjects have different requirement. For example a Chemistry project will be entirely different than an English project. By having the teacher design to project it will insure that the students will learn something based on that specific subject instead of having a general topic for every subject, which would not benefit anyone.

Additionally, the summer project will help the student retain the information through the months of the summer. By doing this throughout the span of the summer the students, ideally, will work on it during that time. This will help them and keep them from not forgetting the information needed to complete the project. The information given will probably be really important in the following years to come and will be better if the students would just retain the information and learn from it, rather than just forgetting it and theÂ information being retaught every single year. By having the teachers design the project it will aid the students in staying on task and continuing throughout the summer. There will be a heavier workload since it will span over several months and students will be retaining the information from the previous years. It would be smart of the students to spread their workload to help them retain the information, by doing this it will make sure they arent doing it all in the beginning of summer than forgetting or doing nothing until the end and forgetting everything before you even start the project.

In light of that, the teachers assigning the project will make sure that the students will be safe and have fun while doing it. To experience a well organized project as well as learning something and all together having a good time is a great learning experience for the students. However if the students were the ones creating the project it would be a disaster. But there could be some good reasons for it, though the bad does outweigh the good. For example if the students made the project it would make sense to the students and their understanding of the materials at hand. But it would have to go through trails to make sure the project is actually safe to do at home by their selves. Therefore in the long run it would be more work for the student and the teachers if the students came up with the summer project by themselves. A safer and better way to do things would to compromise theÂ options for students,the teachers could come up with the project ideas and have the students vote on the one they would rather do. As well as having many options for students to pick from over the summer so they are not limited to or only have one option to chose from.

In conclusion, there is always a better way to do things that includes being logical about your decision and safe. This would be letting the summer project be designed by teachers. By taking this route the projects would help the students learn, retain, and experience the information that will be or has been taught in the classroom. Although there could be a compromise between the students and teachers by collaborating ideas between the two parties and coming up with options from that. But the teacher path would be the best route because it will insure the students safety as well as the material they learn throughout the summer.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

These electors vote for the president in favor of their party which is not always trustworthy or reliable. The popularity winner can also lose, due to lack in electoral votes. Many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In reality, electoral system is outdated and should be tweaked of how it would work today.

Voters can't control who their electors vote for president. The electoral college should be changed to popularity votes because, ""the electors could always defy the will of people""The Indefensible Electoral.

Additionally, the popularity winner can lose by having less electoral votes. Voters can be discouraged to elect their president when really the electors do the job. This situation has happened when,""Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes""In Defense Of. Any election, voters can expect another close election in which the popular winner could again lose the presidency. The electoral college is unstable and this major downside is a factor.

The author gives the reader a realistic condition of Venus of why it is worth it but dangerous. In paragraph 5 towards the bottom the authors describes the conditions by saying Â¨...temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth./ Not easy conditions, but survivable for humansÂ¨. The author gives us a little scare of how it is dangerous because the temperature levels is Â¨at around 170 degreesÂ¨. That is very high and seems that no one would be able to survive there. The author also says Â¨air pressure would be close to that of sea level on EarthÂ¨ which is saying that the air level of 170 degrees is as close sea level so we could pontentially survive it. The author ends is by saying Â¨Not easy conditions, but survivable for humansÂ¨, which explains why he believes that it is dangerous but since it is survivable it is worth the try.

Furthore more, the author gave great explainitory details of what could come if we live on Venus, that of the good and the bad. Throughout the text the author explains ways that Venus is dangerous but can be liveable towards humans. The authors explains ways of how the human population is trying to get to Venus by telling us about NASA

I mean, sure, some games have violence in them, but that doesn't mean we're gonna go out and kill people or anything.

First of all, video games are just that - games! They're meant to be fun and entertaining, not to teach us how to be violent. People who say that video games make us violent are, like, totally missing the point. It's just a game, you know? It's not real life.

And another thing, video games can actually help us relax and de-stress. Like, after a long day at school, I like to come home and play some Call of Duty or whatever. It's a way for me to, like, chill out and forget about all the stress and stuff. It's not making me violent, it's helping me calm down!

Plus, video games can be, like, really educational too. Like, some games teach us about history or science or whatever. They're not just mindless violence, they're actually helping us learn stuff.

But, like, even if video games did make us violent, it's not the game's fault. It's the person's fault for being, like, a psycho or whatever. People who do violent things are just, like, messed up in the head, you know? It's not the game's fault that they're crazy.

DDC53C7B5B42,"My opinion on using cell phones at school is positive. I think that phones should at school because it is needed for kids to call their parents to pick them up after school. Another reason is because what if one day a student finds somebody that needs help and need to call the ambulance. That student could save that persons life I say that for experience. Also in any type of emergencies like when your guardian or your friend, neighbor etc drop you of and forget something they could just call you so the guardian doesn't have to stop where their going and go all the way to the office to give them your stuff. Also the students would to check on their family when somebody is sick.

Another reason is if the principal is nice and cool enough to let us use our phones during free time. We will consider the kind ness to us and respect the knew rules. It would get us closer to the teachers and all staff. We would be like having the coolest school ever. If we are allowed to use our phones at school we would consider the principal understanding that we want to entertain ourselves when we are having free time somehow.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
CFA85271A07D,"Imagine being a student on summer break and still letting your teacher decide what project you are doing, would you want that? While some may say that teacher designed projects over the summer time are better, I disagree with that statement. Letting students make their own projects for summer lets them have more creativeness, it makes the project easier on them, and could lets them enjoy their projects a lot more since they dont have to follow some guidelines. I know I would want to have a student designed project especially since its summer time. When students get their own student designed project it lets them have more creativeness, easier projects, and lets them have more fun with their project.

When a student gets to design his or her own project it lets them be creative which will lead to a better project. Creativeness leads to great things, something that is emphasized by almost every teacher. In addition, a student project that is designed by them is the science fair and some amazing projects come out of that every year. When you are stuck following guidelines their is not much to do with your project, when I had to make my own project I got an A+ on it. Creativeness leads to overall better projects, which teachers will like more.

Students making there own project lets them have an easier time with the project. They know the own guidelines and rules since they designed the project. I know when I was in this situation I benefited a lot from letting me make my own guidelines to follow make the project easier for me to do. When the project is easier that gives me more motivation to do it, so all my time spent on the project is productive. Students benefit a lot when they are doing something that comes easy to them.

While making your own project it lets you enjoy your time working on the project. Working on a project where you are having fun and enjoying yourself is a much better experience than just slugging it out. Their is a saying that ""time flies when you're having fun,"" that could apply to the project too. When Im having fun it leads to better results and a less amount of work time. Also, why would a teacher not want you to have fun while you're on summer break.

Some could argue that teacher designed projects are better due to them being more structured and proper. Student designed projects are still the better option, when a student is creative it leads to an overall better project. They also have an easier time with the project, which leads to more motivation to do the project and get it over with. Also , actually enjoying the project leads to an overall better and less amount of work time.

Thesis

I strongly believe that knowledge is more important than imagination.

Claims

Knowledge is essential to success and progress in life.

Can imagination be beneficial to you?

Imagination can be helpful in certain situations, but it is not a substitute for knowledge.

Imagination can happen to some people.

Knowledge is more important than imagination because it provides a foundation for understanding the world around us.

Knowledge helps us make informed decisions and take action towards our goals.

Imagination can be a useful tool for problem-solving and innovation, but it is not a replacement for knowledge.

For example, if you want to start a business, you need to have knowledge about the industry, market trends, and financial management. You cannot rely solely on imagination to make your business successful.

Imagination can also be a distraction from reality and lead to unrealistic expectations.

In conclusion, while imagination can be helpful in certain situations, it is not a substitute for knowledge. Knowledge provides a foundation for understanding the world around us and helps us make informed decisions towards our goals. Therefore, I strongly believe that knowledge is more important than imagination.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

5017EF96E33C,"Some schools require summer project to assure that they students are continuing their learning habits. If so I think the project should be student-designed.Â Whenever there's a project it's always teacher-designed. If the student is designing the project the teacher get to see how very creative they are. This will help Student not to compare each other. By doing that the student have more confidence in them self.

My first statement on this Student designed project is the comparing that every single student does I mean every student does this to them self. It's different when student are checking to see if they done everything for the project with another student. In the world we live in today is all about what this person have and what I don't have. Students will compare each other no matter if they have A's or C's they will compare each others. Comparing breaks down the confidence in their-self and by them doing that it destroy their reason to do better for them-selves.

My second statement is the it helps the students to express them-selves in many different ways that truly makes student more happy to do and finish the project. I have a project in Spanish class that is about us. Some of my classmates are writing, typing, poster board, and a PowerPoint on the project. It made my class happy to do it by letting them show some creative. I know that a teacher loves for students to show off their creative.

My third statement students will learn to respect others opinion on the topic they choose. In the world today our country is divide by people who believe in this and people who don't believe in that. Our country is falling apart because of no respect for other opinions. The world thinks everyone should have one mind set and it's destroying this beautiful place we call America. This will be teaching student to respect others opinions even if you don't agree on it.

As i'm coming to end I believe that summer projects should be student-designed base. It's helping us to learn, grow, and open your eyes to more than our opinions. So teachers make the summer projects student-designed. I know the students will love expressing them-selves in many different ways.

llama_70b_v1471,"Single-use plastics have become a major environmental concern, and there is a heated debate about whether they should be banned or not. As a grade 10 student, I believe that single-use plastics should be banned because of their harmful effects on our planet.

Firstly, single-use plastics contribute to pollution in a big way. Plastic products such as straws, bags, and water bottles are used once and then discarded, often ending up in our oceans and landfills. This pollution harms marine life, as animals can ingest or get entangled in plastic debris. For instance, sea turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them, which can cause blockages in their digestive tracts and even death. Moreover, plastic pollution also affects human health, as microplastics have been found in our food and water, which could lead to serious health issues.

Secondly, single-use plastics are not biodegradable, meaning they do not break down naturally. They can take hundreds of years to decompose, and when they do, they turn into microplastics that can be consumed by animals, furthering the harmful cycle. For example, a single plastic bag can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. This highlights the urgent need to reduce our plastic waste and transition to more sustainable alternatives.

Furthermore, the production of single-use plastics requires a significant amount of fossil fuels, which contributes to climate change. The extraction and transportation of these fuels also lead to air and water pollution. By banning single-use plastics, we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy sources.

On the other hand, some argue that single-use plastics are convenient and necessary for our daily lives. However, there are many alternatives that are just as convenient and more sustainable. For instance, reusable shopping bags, stainless steel water bottles, and glass straws can be used multiple times, reducing the need for single-use plastics. Additionally, many businesses have already switched to sustainable alternatives, such as paper straws and biodegradable bags, which have shown to be effective and cost-efficient.

In conclusion, the ban of single-use plastics is necessary to protect our environment and promote sustainability. By reducing our plastic waste, we can prevent pollution, protect marine life, and decrease our reliance on fossil fuels. While some may argue that single-use plastics are convenient, the harm they cause outweighs any perceived benefits. It is our responsibility as a society to make conscious choices and adopt sustainable practices to ensure a healthier and safer planet for future generations.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The use of single-use plastic products has become a controversial topic due to its impacts on the environment.

Do you believe that us students really have to do community service?

I believe that student should do community service. I believe that student should do community service because of the environment. I believe that we should all do community service because i think that if we all work together we will have a better environment. I think that each and every one of us could participate in some community service to help. Maybe some of us could clean up beaches and maybe some of us could probably help elderly people or maybe some of us could even clean up the freeways if its needed.

62D6141FFB9E,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the authoor suggests that studying Venus is a bad thing to do and is very dangerous. The author gives a few reasons on why it is dangerous.

First, Venus is a very hot planet. People would sometimes think the hottest planet is Mercury because it is closer to the sun but it isn't the hottest. In paragraph 3 is explains that on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degreea, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. For example, diving to the deepest part of the oceans would liquefy many metals.

Second, a long time ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. But today, Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. So maybe a long time ago it would have been nice to visit but now, it isn't. Way to hot and it is covered all in rocks and valleys.

Lastly, in paragraph 5 it explains that ""Hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" So even if you wanted to try to go to Venus, you would die of heat. Your vehicle would not make it back.. you wouldn't either.

I think the author did good at supporting his idea with many reasons. The author gave many reasons why you shouldn't try to travel to Venus. ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
DC70105E6486,"Is it beneficial to have a student designed project or a teacher designed project.

Student designed work would be beneficial because students would be able to choose work that appeals to them, they would have more motivation to finish the work and it gives students a more diverse selection of topics to choose from.

However not everyone would agree with this position. Some people may argue that a teacher designed project would be more beneficial due to the teacher being able to pick topics that would help students reflect and learn on material set in their class. For example, If you were to be taking a English course the English teacher would most likely assign work about topics that you would learn and have learn about before. Nevertheless there are other view points to consider.

To begin with students would be able to choose work that mostly appeals to them. For example if a student were to be from a unique country or have a unique ethnicity they could choose to have their project be about their culture or beliefs. Doing so would have students more comfortable with their projects due to the fact that they are familiar with who they are and where they come from.

In addition due to being familiar with the topic students have chosen, students would have more motivation as to why they need to finish this project. For instance a student that is familiar with the topic they had chosen for their project would be more motivated to finish than a student that has low intelligence on the topic given. A motivated student always produces but non motivated students are never a guarantee. Nevertheless there are other view points to consider.

Finally, Student designed projects will guarantee that you end up with a diversity of topics from with no repeating composure and subjects. Consider as an example a science fair, when you visit a science fair you are presented with multiple subjects and projects on robots, plants, liquids, etc. Imagine if you were a teacher having to grade the same projects from start to finish what a bore. Nevertheless there are other viewpoints to consider.

In conclusion, would it be better that students choose their own topic? Yes, it allows you to have different viewpoints on the project and diversify the topic and possibilities of the project. Let students choose their own topics and projects now.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
4F39C001C736,"Let's be honest, sometimes people don't know what to do or who to talk to at times. Sometimes we as human beings make mistakes and don't know what decisions to make when we do happen to make a mistake. We panic and we can't seem to think about what we could do in that type of situation. It gives us stress and worry. That is why people need advice from others.

People like teachers, parents, basically adults that can be trusted like priests, police officers, etc give great advice. They have experience with a lotÂ of things when it comes to stress, mistakes, and things we could do to work hard to not make the same mistake again. They also comfort us with support and care for our well-being when we often go through troubling times like bullying, friends, and the facts of life. They also know how hard it is to get good grades for some people and how terrifying the thought of school can be. They know that it can be a nightmare for some to stay awake, study at 12:00 midnight, drink Starbucks(maybe) and overall think about when the next test or SOL or exam will come next.

Again, let's be honest, people just loved to be listened to at times. Whenever someone listens to their advice, they think that person cares about what they have to say and what ideas they have. It's what most people enjoy happening to them including peers the exact same age as you. It gives some people a sense of purpose and empathy for your current situation. Even you want to be listened to don't you?

Most of the time, people could be going through the same situation as you or maybe worse, we may not know what's going on in their life. You listening to their advice could save them from maybe hurting their body or worse. They might get bullied a lotÂ and have little to no friends, but you listening to their advice and an extension them as a whole could really save them and make them a lotÂ more happier. They could suffer a terrible and messed up life. They might have made the same choice as you and could have gotten a much worse consequence out of it.

But sometimes listening to other's advice could do us more harm than good. Sometimes it could get us in an even worse situation then we were in before and it could screw us up a lotÂ more. Sometimes the advice we get would make no sense whatsoever and make the person sound like they have no common sense at all. Sometimes the advice would seem great but then backfire in a horrible twisted way. Sometimes going with your gut would seem to work better. Either way in some cases it would be best to follow your own advice.

So yes, in most if not all cases, you should follow someone's advice whether it be friends, family, etc. It can really save you when your in a pickle and help you make choices based of it. It can make someone feel special and needed. It can save someone who wants to hurt themselfÂ and/or others and give someone a purpose. All and all, listening to someone else's advice could help everyone involved.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
ECC6BDC4B664,"Dear Senator; the electoral voting system should be abolished it is unfair and un-democratic electoral votes are not the votes f the people and thats all that should matter but there are countercaims that I will address. when aperson votes they do not actually vote for their candidate they vote for a group of electors for that candidate electors who may not even vote for the candidate they are sworn to. the electoral voting system is extremly unstable there are an even number of electoral voters in the united states making a tied vote a possibility which is very bad. Even though electoral votes are suposedly based on which candidates people vote for it does not at all mean that the candidate who most of the people voted for wil also be voted for by the electoral college.

The electoral voters are seperated by state and each state has its own number of electoral voters proportional to their population. because of this candidates change their campaigns to only focus on stateswith more electoral voters while this makes sense from a competitive perspective it makes it extremley unfair to states with smaller populations. This is wrong in many ways but the worst of all is that the electoral voting system encourages this kind of copetition

The electoral voting system is un-democratic the united states prides itself on being for the people and freedom but the electoral college represents the exact opposite of that. the electoral college votes not the people. the people are not voting and that is the exact opposite of what the united states supossedly stands for.

8d6316ed84dd_04112023,"Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing to respectfully express my views regarding the proposed policy change that would require students to maintain at least a B average in order to participate in sports and extracurricular activities. While maintaining good grades is important, I believe such a strict requirement may negatively impact student involvement and achievement. 

Limiting participation only to students with B's or higher risks discouraging involvement from those working hard to improve their grades. Many students find that sports and clubs provide motivation to focus on their schoolwork, and extra time commitments leave less opportunity for distraction. Taking this away could reduce academic effort from some on the cusp of a B average. As students dealing with personal challenges or difficult course loads, the social and mental breaks provided by activities can help them persist when studies become stressful. 

A C average still demonstrates that students are passing their classes and making progress. Some students naturally struggle more in certain subjects but work very diligently. They deserve recognition and support through continued inclusion. Strict cutoff policies often do not account for full student circumstances and can feel unfair to those giving their best effort. 

Instead of driving participation down, keeping requirements more moderate empowers greater numbers of students to get involved and experience the many educational benefits of extracurriculars. These include learning time management, developing teamwork skills, finding belonging in a school community, and exploring interests that inspire continued study. Especially as we emerge from these difficult pandemic times, programs that rally school spirit and connection should remain broadly accessible.

For the above reasons, I believe the proposed B average policy may be too rigid and risk reducing student involvement and motivation unnecessarily. A C average demonstrates passing grades and effort deserving of support through continued opportunity for enrichment. Maintaining a more moderate standard empowers broader participation that research shows aids learning. I appreciate your consideration of these views as decisions are made regarding changes to policy.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",1,darragh_claude_v6,,1
a154688f,"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This trend is gaining popularity across the globe, as evidenced by the car-free communities in Germany, the driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and create more livable and vibrant communities.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some parts of the United States, that number can go as high as 50 percent. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint. This is particularly important in the fight against climate change and the pursuit of sustainable living.

Another benefit is the reduction of traffic congestion. Cars are the linchpin of suburban life, but their dominance on the roads leads to clogged highways and busy streets. By promoting car-free communities like Vauban in Germany, we can create more accessible and walkable neighborhoods. Placing stores along main streets instead of distant highways encourages people to walk or bike, reducing traffic congestion and improving overall mobility.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more livable and vibrant communities. The car-dominated suburbs that were popular in the 1950s may no longer be sustainable in the face of increasing car ownership and urbanization. By prioritizing public transportation, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, we can create communities that are more connected and cohesive. This not only improves the quality of life for residents but also attracts visitors and boosts local economies.

Moreover, the trend of limiting car usage can also have positive implications for public health. By encouraging active transportation like walking and biking, we can promote physical activity and reduce the sedentary lifestyle that often comes with car-centric living. This can help combat issues such as obesity and improve overall public health outcomes.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, creating livable communities, and promoting public health, we can move towards a more sustainable and resilient future. The examples of car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to embrace this trend and work towards a future with a reduced reliance on cars.",1,radek_500,,4

Also becuase on the surface of Venuse the temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit.""the pressure is 90 times grater than what we experience on our own planet"". This is saying that this enviroment would crush a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans on earth. Also venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our sorlar system. With it being that hot it would liquify the metals we have on earth.

8BC2D4B87F27,"The benefits of taking music, drama, and art classes for students should not be underestimated. These activities can not only give young people the opportunity to express their creativity, but can also help to sustain their mental health. For instance, music can act as a form of mindfulness and provide an essential outlet for stress relief. Drama classes can also offer invaluable opportunities to practice interpersonal communication skills such as public speaking, as well as giving students an opportunity to build confidence and find their own creative voice. 

However, it is also important to touch upon the potential drawbacks to taking music, drama, and arts classes. For instance, these activities can be time-consuming and can take away from time that students could have spent on schoolwork. Furthermore, there is often an intimidating element that comes with these types of performances; having an audience can be difficult for some students, especially those who are more introverted. 

Importantly, parental support plays a critical role in the success of taking these activities. Without encouragement from their parents to try new things and promote confidence, students may not have the confidence to try out these activities or feel comfortable enough to do so. Encouragement from parents can make the whole experience less stressful and more enjoyable overall. Examples of this could include providing support when students are preparing for an upcoming performance or class.  Additionally, parents can attend classes and shows with their children to celebrate their successes.  Ultimately, having this type of parental support is essential for students in these activities.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Research the benefits of taking music, drama, and art classes for students.

F2010012FD04,"There are certain situations where some students do not enjoy school. In some cases, it is sitting in a class with a teacher they do not bond with. In other scenarios, students have trouble with being in a big group for long periods of time. These students would benefit vastly from online school. These students can be taught through voice chats or online software that are provided by the school systems. Home schooling can be very beneficial for students because it is not always easy to make friends, students can have more time to finish their work, and the anxiety of being in the physical school building disappears.

In most school systems, their are always the students who are picked on or have a difficult time making friends. These students should enroll in online school. They would benefit greatly from thisÂ because, they do not have to worry about where they are going to sit at during lunch, or who will they talk to during the next period. All of that worry is instantly removed when these students take online classes. This will not only help with the students emotionalÂ feelings, but will also help get there grades up. The less time students spend worrying, the more time they will spend on studying and their other school work. Thus, online school is a perfect solutions for students who have trouble making friends.

Many students have a lot of stress. The majority of this stress comes from school and getting a lot of extra work. In order to decrease the amount of stress that comes with school, students need more time to get their work done. This can all be accomplished by the home school system. Students can work at their own pace, and finish their work as they please. The individuals who have more time to get their work done well succeed far greater than students who have 1 to 2 weeks to complete all of their work. In conclusion, students that take online classes have more time to finish their work, which also lowers their stress level.

School can be hard for students. Whether it be a students who needs to move around and fidget a lot, or someone who moves around schools very often. This can all lead anxiety at a certain degree. Anxiety makes learning nearly impossible. Students go to class with a knot in the pit of their stomach just waiting for the dismissalÂ bell. This could all be easily eliminated. TheÂ solution is home schooling these individuals. These young adults can move around freely as they choose and do not have to worry about where their next class is going to be located. This will help them stay focused and be able to work to their full potential. Thus, online school is a great alternativeÂ for studentsÂ with anxiety.

Some critics may argue that home schooling students lets them loose valuable social skills. They also may say that home school is not as challengingÂ as a regular school system. The students who are enrolled in online classes still go out and attend social events, therefore; they do not loose these skills. In online school you learn the same criteria as a student in a public school. Thus, making it just as challenging. Online classes are very helpful for studentsÂ because it is hard to make friends , you can work at your own pace, and it removes all anxiety of being inside of the school building.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

F1B1760AD63F,"Collaboration, team-work, and being considerate of others are essential components of success in various contexts. Whether it is in the workplace, family, school, or social relationships, these qualities can greatly impact the outcomes we achieve. In this essay, I will explore how collaboration, team-work, and being considerate of others can shape success in different contexts.

Firstly, collaboration is crucial in the workplace. In today's fast-paced business environment, companies are constantly seeking ways to improve productivity and efficiency. Collaboration allows employees to share ideas, resources, and expertise, which can lead to innovative solutions and increased efficiency. For example, a software development team may collaborate to design and develop a new application, which can be successful in the market. Collaboration can also help to build trust and foster a positive work environment, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and employee retention.

Secondly, team-work is essential in family and school settings. Families and schools rely on teamwork to achieve common goals, such as raising children and educating students. In families, parents work together to provide for their children's needs, such as food, shelter, and education. In schools, teachers and staff work together to provide a quality education for students. Teamwork can also help to build strong relationships and foster a sense of community. For example, a school team may work together to organize a fundraiser for a specific cause, which can bring the community together and raise awareness for the cause.

Thirdly, being considerate of others is crucial in all aspects of life. Being considerate of others means taking into account their needs, feelings, and perspectives. This can lead to better relationships, increased empathy, and a sense of compassion. For example, in a workplace, being considerate of others can lead to better communication, increased trust, and a more positive work environment. In family settings, being considerate of others can lead to better relationships, increased understanding, and a sense of unity. In school settings, being considerate of others can lead to better relationships, increased empathy, and a sense of community.

These qualities can greatly impact the outcomes we achieve in the workplace, family, school, and social relationships. By working together, sharing",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,3
77A31D0A07A8,"Ralph Waldo Emerson famously said, âBy growth we mean the enlargement of our powers and facilities, the opening to us of vaster resources of action.â To him, and many others, mastering a skill as part of the process of self-improvement and growth is essential. Mastery of a skill, whether related to a profession or not, can lead to immense personal and professional growth.

For instance, investing a significant amount of time to learning a new language as a hobby has unlocked a wide range of opportunities for me personally. It has opened up new job prospects, made me more marketable for employers, and enabled me to move in more global circles. Similarly, learning a complex craft such as knitting or woodworking provided me with a sense of personal satisfaction and increased confidence.

However, growth is not limited to mastering a skill. It is possible for someone to become a wiser, more self-aware individual and grow without mastering any particular skill. Bill Gates echoes this sentiment and states, âItâs fine to celebrate success, but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure. Learning what not to do is sometimes more important than learning what to do.â Taking the time to reflect on life experiences helps to inform decisions in the future and can assist in personal growth.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

AB37B00A93F1," Politics is a crucial aspect of society that affects every individual's life in one way or another. While some people may believe that politics is a good thing, others argue that it can be a hindrance to personal growth and development. In this essay, I will argue that politics can be both good and bad, depending on how it is approached.

On one hand, politics can be a positive force in society. It can bring about change and progress, and it can provide a platform for individuals to voice their opinions and concerns. Additionally, politics can help to foster a sense of community and belonging among people. By following the rulers and being kind to those around us, we can create a more positive and harmonious society.

On the other hand, politics can also be a negative force in society. It can lead to division and conflict, and it can be used to manipulate and control individuals. Additionally, politics can be a source of stress and anxiety for many people, as they may feel that their voices are not being heard or that their opinions are not being taken seriously.

Ultimately, the impact of politics on our lives depends on how we choose to approach it. If we are willing to be open-minded and respectful of others, and if we are willing to engage in constructive dialogue and debate, then politics can be a positive force in our lives. However, if we allow ourselves to be swayed by fear and prejudice, and if we are unwilling to listen to the perspectives of others, then politics can be a source of pain and suffering.

In conclusion, politics can be both good and bad, depending on how we choose to approach it. It is important that we strive to be kind and respectful to those around us, and that we engage in constructive dialogue and debate. By doing so, we can create a more positive and harmonious society for ourselves and future generations.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

falcon_180b_v1_203,"I strongly disagree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities can be beneficial, making them mandatory takes away the element of choice and can lead to negative consequences.

Firstly, some students may not have the time or energy to participate in extracurricular activities due to personal reasons such as family responsibilities or health issues. Forcing them to participate could add unnecessary stress and pressure to their already busy lives. This could also impact their academic performance and mental health.

Secondly, not all students are interested in the same extracurricular activities. Making them mandatory could lead to a lack of enthusiasm and poor performance in the activity. It would be better to let students choose activities they are passionate about, as this will lead to greater engagement and better results.

Lastly, making extracurricular activities mandatory could also create a culture of competition and exclusivity. Students may feel pressured to join certain activities just to fit in or impress their peers, rather than because they genuinely enjoy them. This could lead to a toxic environment and harm the overall well-being of students.

Firstly, participating in school role-plays can be a great way to develop confidence and improve my emotional state. Through role-playing, I can practice different scenarios and learn how to handle them in a safe and controlled environment. This can help me feel more comfortable and prepared in real-life situations. Additionally, role-playing can be a fun way to express myself and explore different aspects of my personality.

Secondly, engaging in fun and safe science experiments can be a great way to increase my attention and focus. Science experiments can be exciting and engaging, and they can help me develop a deeper understanding of the world around me. By participating in science experiments, I can also learn important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and experimentation.

Thirdly, exploring my hidden talents, particularly in music, can be a great way to learn to express myself in that medium. Music can be a powerful tool for self-expression, and by exploring my talents in music, I can learn to express myself in a way that is meaningful and fulfilling. Additionally, learning to play an instrument or sing can be a great way to develop discipline and focus.

Finally, taking advantage of all school resources can be a great way to learn and have a positive mindset. School resources such as tutoring, counseling, and academic support can be incredibly helpful in helping me succeed academically. Additionally, by utilizing these resources, I can develop a positive mindset and learn to approach challenges with a growth mindset.

6A62CD23AF8B,"Seven hours per day for five days a week and some students have activities to do after school, along with that students have mountain high piles of homework nightly. Some couldn't fathom the amount of stress that students are under today. For those reasons, a principal adding a mandatory extracurricular activity is understandable, yet unrealistic.

Seven hours of school for five days is a very large amount of time spent on academics, but some students also do sports, tutoring, or some other activity after school in the very minimal time they have. Students who participate in sports may have been doing it all their life, so adding an extracurricular could possibly affect their sports schedule. Other students may be struggling with an aspect of school and they go to tutoring for that reason. Adding an extracurricular could interfere with the help they need to succeed.

Starting from age seven students are asked to do homework. When students are seven and in 1st grade they may not have a large amount of homework; however, when students are in high school the quantity will only grow. While some homework may not take much time for one student, another student may struggle with the assignment. For those reasons, it would be hard to expect much of a student if they also have to participate in an extracurricular.

9F113E685AD0,"Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am one of your students attending SCHOOL_NAME. My view on you changing the policy is out of the question. Yes there are some reasons that might be helpful but students that love sports shouldn't have to be anything less that what is expected of them. The policy should remain the same because some kids that are very talented in sports more than others, may struggle in just one specific class. Most students that have a B average are not participating in sports at our school.

Many high school and middle school students struggle in the some of the same classes such as Math, History/Social Studies, English, Science/Biology/Chemistry. These are all tough classes but could be more difficult for students in different areas of the subject. For example, if our high school football team is going to the championships and our star player/quarter back has an 85% in Biology and is turning in a minor paper due 2 days before game time, and the teacher grades it as a C. This student with an 85% in that class has a B right now but if them get a C on a minor paper there grade could drop to somewhere in the low 80's or high 70's which no longer is considered a B average. Your star player and quarter back is out for the game and possible risk loosing the championship all because of one small paper.

There are many clubs out there for students to join and have fun in, but more than likely half the students in those clubs don't play sports and have at least a B average. Think of all the kids that aren't in those clubs that do play sports and are just short of a B average. People with an A average like you participate in Science Olympiad, Book clubs, and math clubs. But others who play Volleyball, Cross Country, Basketball, Wrestling, Track, Softball, Swimming and so on may not be capable of being in those clubs due to class grades. If you change the policy and make it so only people with a B average can play sports then you might be cutting out half of the school from your sport programs.

Please consider my reasoning about why the school sports policy should not be changed. Some that are very talented in sports more than others, may struggle in just one specific class, and most students that have a B average are not participating in sports at our school. I hope you will keep it the same.

BAB1FB7CF30F,"As students are furthering their education, teachers are assigning summer assignments in order to prepare them for their upcoming class. Many believe these summer assignments should be student designed due to students' convenience, nevertheless, these summer assignments should be teacher designed because it ensures that students are prepared for the class, exposes them to new material outside of their comfort zone, and keeps students' busy throughout the break.

Before the school year ends, teachers take time out of their work day to produce a summer assignment for their students' next school year. Having teacher designed summer assignments help ensure that students are ready for the content in their upcoming year. Students are unable to know their struggles with next years content until they are actually in that class. Teachers are able to look at their lower scoring topics of the year and put a couple questions of that topic onto the summer assignment. By doing this, it will help the students learn from the past students' struggle topics. Because of the summer assignment, students are able to get a boost and learn quicker when they are being taught in class. An example of this happened during a student's sophomore year while picking their junior year classes. This particular student had to choose between academic biology or honors biology; they were unsure of which class they wanted to take. The student eventually choose honors biology in the end; she found out that about the summer assignment due the first week of classes. She struggled with converting units and was nervous the topic would be a struggle in the class. Her teacher assured her that it was normal to struggle as many other students struggled with that as well. She complained on and on until she came into class that next year and excelled due to the summer assignment she completed. If the student had designed her own summer assignment, she would not have excelled as well as she did because of the teacher designed summer assignment.

As teachers are designing their own summer assignment for their class, they put new material that the students have never been exposed to. While many express how having student designed summer assignments give students more freedom; they don't realize how most students will not go outside of their comfort zone to learn new material. If the students were to design their own summer assignment, all of the material will be information that they already knew or are most comfortable with. Teacher designed summer assignments will give a chance for the student to push themselves out of their comfort zone to learn new information that will ultimately help them with their next school year. For example, the summer before junior year, an AP Language and Composition teacher gave students an assignment that included reading or watching 15 sources. These 15 sources had to be stretched out from 5 different categories: current events, history, politics, entertainment, and documentaries. The students were forced out of their comfort zone by their teacher having their students exposed to all of the different categories. Because of the exposure, the students are aware of information they would not have known if they didn't complete the assignment. When given the chance, students will stay in their own comfort zone; which the teachers can break when there are teacher designed summer assignments.

When the teachers are trying to break students' comfort zones with the summer assignments, it gives the students a chance to think outside of the box and spend more time trying to interpret the new information. For most students, summer break is filled with eating and watching TV on their couch; if the students were given the chance to design their own assignment for the break, they would put easy information for them to complete in order for them to have more time to spend on the couch eating chips. The students would come back with their minds still tangled up with the TV and couch; if teachers were to design the assignment, the teachers would put information that they know would keep the students' minds busy and working throughout the summer. This makes it easier for students to ease back into school; rather than them still being in summer mode 3 months into the school year.

Being eased back into the school year is a thing many students struggle with. It can be fixed by having teacher designed summer assignments. It is time for all teachers to regulate teacher designed summer assignments in order to make the school year easier for all students. While many students will complain about the workload, it will pay off later when they realize the summer assignment helped them with the content of the class. They will also be interested in new topics because of the teachers input in the summer assignment to push them outside of their comfort zone. Overall, summer assignments have been proven to assist students all around when they are teacher designed.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

When talking to more thanÂ one person forÂ advise can hep someone make better choices, for it prevents consequences, it develops social skills, and it helps a person know who to ask for advise.

To begin with, talking with multiple people for advise can devolve social skills. There are a lot of people in the world that are very shy or just do not talk at all, maybe it is because he or she has social anxiety or just because he or she does not want to be judgeÂ by saying something wrong, but sometimes getting out of his or her comfort zone to ask for advise can be well for someone. For example, I am a very shy person that barely talks in school, so asking for advise is really hard for me, but when I did, it helped me make a better choice. Communicating with multiple people can help one make new friendships. Seeking different people for advise can make one grow as a person and help one make better choices.

Also, it prevents consequences. Sometimes at school or at work, there is always that one person that bothers you and gets you angry, but asking for advise can help one not get in trouble. If someone already did something bad, and wants to lie because he or she does not want to get in trouble, it is better to ask for advise, so he or she can do the right thing and not get in more trouble. When someone does the right thing and is a well behave child or is a good employee,Â he or she will be a role model for other people. For instance, if a child helps another kid do his homework, it will encourage others to do as well and show kindness. In many schools or even at home, kids get bullied and asking for advise to maybe a friend can encourage he or she to make a better choice and to speak up and tell someone.

In addition, if a person asks for advise from multiple people, it helps one know who to ask for advise. In the world there are good people and bad people. The good people always want the best for someone and the bad people do not and might be fake friends. So it is good to ask multiple people for advise because then he or she will know who are the best people to ask for advise to make a better choice. Sometimes even if it is not what he or she wanted to hear from that person but it is very helpful in life. For example, I one day asked for advise to both of my parents and my pastor on something that I wanted to fix in my life and the response they gave me, was not what I wanted to hear, but it helped me do better in life.

In conclusion, seeking more than one person for advise can help him or her make better choices. It can help a person talk more andÂ develop his or her social skills. It can also help prevent consequences to make someone do the right thing instead of the wrong thing. It can help some know who are the good people and who are not, so when asking for advise, he or she can ask the best people. Asking for advise can be hard sometimes but it will help him or her make better choices in life.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
llama_70b_v1850,"I strongly argue in favor of the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. The reasons for this are numerous, and I will provide several arguments to support my position.

First and foremost, renewable energy sources are sustainable and do not contribute to climate change. Unlike fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power do not produce harmful emissions. This is crucial, as climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. The burning of fossil fuels is a major contributor to rising global temperatures, and the transition to renewable energy sources can help to mitigate this problem.

Secondly, renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly cost-effective. While the initial investment in renewable energy infrastructure can be expensive, the long-term benefits far outweigh the costs. In fact, the cost of renewable energy has been steadily decreasing in recent years, making it more accessible and affordable for individuals and businesses alike. Additionally, the use of renewable energy sources can help to reduce energy dependency and create jobs in the clean energy sector.

Thirdly, renewable energy sources are often locally available, reducing the need for long-distance transmission and distribution of energy. This not only reduces energy loss during transportation but also provides communities with greater control over their energy supply. This can be particularly beneficial for remote or rural communities that may not have had access to energy sources in the past.

Furthermore, the transition to renewable energy sources can improve public health. The burning of fossil fuels releases harmful pollutants into the air, contributing to respiratory problems and other health issues. Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, produce no air pollutants, which can lead to improved air quality and better health outcomes for communities.

Finally, renewable energy sources can promote energy security. By leveraging renewable energy sources, countries can reduce their dependence on imported fossil fuels, which can be subject to geopolitical risks and price volatility. This can help to stabilize energy prices and promote energy independence, which is critical for national security.

In conclusion, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is essential for the sustainability of our planet. Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly cost-effective, locally available, and promote energy security, all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving public health. I strongly argue in favor of this transition and urge policymakers and individuals alike to support the shift towards renewable energy sources.",1,llama_70b_v1,"In recent years, there has been a push towards using renewable energy sources.

F21CBEE52702,"In certain schools they have a required summer project that is either teacher designed or student designed.

My position is the students should design these project because students have a bigger imagination, and if we create the project we're more likely to do it. I will get into more detail as i continue.

Some schools require a summer project, and my position states that students should design these projects because students have a bigger imagination than teachers. My reasoning for that statement is we're still young and we see stuff more different than adults. For example picture a little boy and a forty year old man the little boy imagination is something you wouldn't expect, and the old man imagination and creativity isn't really on point like the little boy. But the little boy has all these ideas that one day can save the world, my point is you expanding your mind just a little bit can produce one of the best ideas. Which is why i think students should design these projects because of our imaginationÂ which can expand into a different realm and create a great idea for a project which more students would want to do because a student created it and the creativity put into it will attract us students.

Therefor If students created this project we are going to more likely want to do it. Because the fact that the students created it that alone would push students to want to do it more. Seeing your peers create a project that you can relate too would also push you to do it. Us younger people use social media as a outlet to sell things etc... but if we put the project design on social media, and catch our peers attention and they like it. More and more students would complete or at least try because of the creativity and it was a peer telling you, not no commanding teacher.

I would choose students to create this summer project design. Because the fact that if a peer put it out there and is creating it we're more likely going to do it. We think differnet we reach into the non reality part of life and make it reality. I also agree with the fact that our imagination is way bigger then teachers because what were used to seeing on television etc.. anything could be possible from what we've seen so far in our life.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
7B0430EDACBA,"Hey, so for this essay, I gotta talk about how having a positive attitude can lead to success in different situations, like school, relationships, and when we're facing difficult obstacles in life. And I gotta analyze how having a positive attitude can affect the outcomes in these situations.

First off, having a positive attitude in school can totally help you succeed. When you're positive and motivated, you're more likely to pay attention in class, do your homework, and study for tests. And that means you'll get better grades and stuff. Plus, when you're in a good mood, you're more likely to make friends and get along with your teachers, which can make school way more enjoyable.

But it's not just school. Having a positive attitude in relationships can also lead to success. When you're in a good mood and you're positive, you're more likely to be a good listener, be supportive, and be understanding. And that can help you build stronger relationships with your friends and family. Plus, when you're positive, you're less likely to get upset or mad at little things, which can help you avoid arguments and stuff.

And finally, having a positive attitude can help you deal with difficult obstacles in life. When you're positive, you're more likely to see challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than as roadblocks that can't be overcome. And that can help you stay motivated and determined to overcome them. Plus, when you're positive, you're more likely to be resilient and bounce back from setbacks, which can help you keep going even when things get tough.

So, like, there are tons of examples of people who have had success from having a positive attitude. For instance, Oprah Winfrey, she's all about positivity and she's super successful. And she's always talking about how having a positive attitude helped her overcome obstacles and achieve her goals. And same with Ellen DeGeneres, she's always spreading positivity and joy, and she's one of the most popular and successful comedians out there.

So yeah, having a positive attitude can totally lead to success in different situations. It can help you succeed in school",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Analyze how having a positive attitude can lead to success in different situations such as school, relationships, and difficult obstacles in life.

In my opinion we acomplish more if we are always doing something because some times we have stuff to do for example going to work after school or study after school. But some time people they don't like to do school work for the reason they think there are not smart. In my position do work it's some i like to do every day because that's how i learn more stuff.

755082ED81B6,"""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curisoty will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports his idea well by giving details on what challenges Venus gives, reasons as to why scientists are fascianted on exploring the planet, and plausible solutions on how to explore Venus despite the complications.

The author presents details as to why Venus is a challenge to explore by giving descriptions on its envrionment. In paragraph 3, the article states ""...Venus has the hottest surface temperature on any planet in our solar system..."" and ""...planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit..."" These statements provide a sensory detail of why humans aren't able to withstand the conditions of Venus, because it is extremely hot for us to withstand. Another example is, ""...Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This demonstrates the complication as to why spacecrafts have a hard time landing on Venus to explore, which is weather and environmental factors impose a threat to damaging the spacecraft.

The author in the article helps support his idea by giving reasons as to why scientists are fascianted on exploring the planet Venus. In paragraph 4, it states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This examines why scientists are curious on exploring the planet because if it has been the most Earth-like planet it ""...could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth,"" as stated in the fourth paragraph. Another example is ""...Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This exclaims that since Venus is not that far away to travel to compared to other planets, it cuts down space travel time which is beneficial to humans since they cannot live hundreds of years.

The author continues to supports his ideas by proposing plausible solutions on how to explore Venus despite the complications. In paragraph 5, it says ""... a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" This example provides information on how a hovering vehicle would help astronauts to avoid the environmental factors making it easier to explore Venus by aerial view. In paragraph 7, it states ""Another project is looking back to an old techonology called mechanical computers... these devices make calculations by using gearws and levers and do not require electronics at all."" This example helps exancuate on how old technology can help collect data on Venus by being able to be more resistent to its conditions compare to modern technology that is delicate.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagnication and innovation. The author highlighted points as to why Venus would be a difficult planet to explore, but expunds on the solutions and inspirations why its a worthy pursuit. The author exclaimes his points by giving details on what challenges Venus gives, reasons as to why scientists are fascianted on exploring the planet, and plausible solutions on how to explore Venus despite the complications.

llama_70b_v1476,"I think that the use of animals in scientific research is a really important topic for us to talk about. Like, I know that some people might say that it's wrong to use animals in research because it's not nice to hurt them, but I think that it's important to remember that animals can help us learn things that can help us make new medicines and treatments that can help people get better.

For example, like, my grandma had cancer and she had to go through a lot of treatments and surgeries to get better. And some of those treatments were developed because of research that was done on animals. So, like, if it wasn't for animals being used in research, my grandma might not be here today.

But, like, I also understand that it's not right to hurt animals just for no reason. So, like, I think that scientists should only use animals in research when it's really necessary and they should try to use the minimum number of animals needed to get the results they need. And they should also make sure that the animals are treated well and don't suffer too much.

So, like, I don't think that we should completely stop using animals in research, but we should be careful about how we use them and make sure that we're not hurting them unnecessary.

Also, like, I think that we should also try to find other ways to do research that don't involve animals, like using cells or computers to simulate the way the human body works. That way, we can still learn things without hurting animals.

Both sports and science activities involve learning and can also be fun for students, but musical activities often provide an immediate sense of enjoyment and can be more thrilling. Through musical activities, students can cultivate their creativity, learn to work with others, and build self-confidence. I personally find musical activities to be the most enjoyable form of educational activity within our school because of the direct links to art, creativity, and collaboration.

I remember my first foray into musical activities in school when I signed up for choir. I was able to learn music theory, collaborate with the other members to create beautiful melodies, and there was always a sense of joy and accomplishment when we accomplished something great. Furthermore, performing on stage in front of an audience and seeing their reactions is one of the most fulfilling experiences I have ever had.

Although cell phones haven't been around for the longest time, they have become an essential part of our lives. Cars and other vehicles have become great assets in daily life as well. Combining the two, however, is a terrible idea. Texting and driving is extremely dangerous, and leads to nearly a million and a half crashes per year. It switches the focus from the road to your hand, and makes you a weapon, capable of easily ending someone's life. Texting and driving is a product of this generation because it takes your attention off the road, is caused by a lack of responsibility, and causes a forth of all car accidents per year.

The teenage generation causes a large majority of accidents due to their lesser experience, but also because of their addiction to social media. They are easily absorbed into their phones, unable to realize that a truck is turning into you. One moment, your texting your best friend about kittens, the next your bones are broken, and you hang from the floor, your car upside down at the bottom of a hill.

This extremely deadly situation has a very easy solution; put the device in your pocket!

However, the temptation to do otherwise leads to those situations. Sometimes it's not their fault, though. Some teens aren't taught how to be responsible with their electronics, and later in life, their eyes are still glued to that screen. They then have to learn the hard way, by wrecking. That's why we should teach the younger generation about safety, texting and driving, and to pay attention to the road.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
F5A5B0906BE8," Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it has brought about significant changes in the way we live, work, and interact with each other. While technology has its advantages and disadvantages, I believe that the benefits of technology far outweigh the drawbacks.

One of the most significant advantages of technology is its ability to connect people from all over the world. Social media platforms, email, and instant messaging apps have made it possible for people to communicate with each other in real-time, regardless of their location. This has made it easier for businesses to expand their reach and for individuals to stay in touch with friends and family members who live far away.

Another advantage of technology is its ability to provide us with instant access to information. With the internet, we can find answers to our questions, learn new skills, and stay up-to-date with the latest news and trends in just a few clicks. This has made it easier for people to make informed decisions and has opened up new opportunities for learning and growth.

However, technology also has its drawbacks. One of the main concerns is that it can be addictive, with people spending hours scrolling through social media or playing video games instead of engaging in more meaningful activities. Additionally, technology can be expensive, and not everyone has access to the latest devices or internet connections.

Despite these drawbacks, I believe that the benefits of technology far outweigh the negatives. Technology has made it possible for us to connect with people from all over the world, provided us with instant access to information, and has made it easier for us to learn and grow. As long as we use technology responsibly and ensure that everyone has access to it, I believe that technology will continue to be a positive force in our lives.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

During a lesson the computer could detect boredom on students faces and then the teacher could change her lesson to make it more interesting. Could a computer become the next version of a mood ring?

During a school day there are many students who get in trouble. With FACS school officals could predict who will act out during a given school day.

9947BA6C3149," Distance learning has become an increasingly popular option for students in recent years, and for good reason. With the advent of the internet, students now have the ability to take classes online or communicate with teachers from the comfort of their own homes. This can be especially beneficial for students who may have busy schedules or other responsibilities that make it difficult to attend traditional classes.

One of the biggest advantages of distance learning is that it can help students avoid the negative influences that may be present in a traditional classroom setting. For example, bullying is a major problem in many schools, and teachers may struggle to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all students. By taking classes online, students can avoid the potential for bullying and focus on their education without distraction.

In addition, distance learning can be a more flexible option for students who may have other responsibilities outside of school. For example, many students have jobs or other commitments that make it difficult to attend traditional classes during the day. With distance learning, students can complete their coursework at their own pace and on their own schedule, making it easier to balance their education with other responsibilities.

Of course, there are some potential downsides to distance learning as well. For example, students may miss out on the social interaction and support that they would receive in a traditional classroom setting. Additionally, some students may struggle with self-discipline and motivation when working independently.

I'm going to just get straight to it; I don't think you should ban students with less than a C average from after school sports and activities. I feel quite strongly about this. My reasons are that, although I never participate in after school clubs and such, I am certain that they are very important to many of this schools C average students. For some students, I'm afraid to say, sports and activities are the only reason they have for coming to school anyways. If it weren't for sports, I believe they'd ditch school instead. Not to mention that a few who only manage a C, might just be unable to juggle school and sports... at least, not on their own. Perhaps, instead of cancelling sports for C students, they could be tutored, by teachers or fellow students. Encouraged to ask for help, instead of 'grounding' them for not. Its just in their nature not to want help. I know a few students who can't do without their after school fun and have no where to go after school hours but clubs.

D6E2AF2B1B54,"Society is infatuated by the option of distance learning some schools are now offering to their students. However, online education is not as beneficial as in-school learning. Distance learning does not ensure that the required necessary skills will be provided. Hence, as pleasurable as attending classes from home seems, students will not gain those crucial experiences and the self development that they need.

Moreover, society knows school may not be the most simple time, but it can be the most useful. Vital experiences that tend to be blown off have some of the greatest impacts on people. For an example, group projects teaches students how to communicate efficiently, reciprocate one another opinions, and know how to handle disagreements. They can connect and accept advice from each otherÂ which helps them learn how to see different perspectives. Online education, undoubtedly, will not be able to provide these experiences.

In addition, socializing is a necessity in school. From telling the lunch lady what you would like to purchase, to asking a teacher to further explain a problem. This is a time in life people tend to learn how to communicate with people and become more social. Studies show that 82% of home schooledÂ individualsÂ are not as social as students physically in school. However, some may say, students who arent social have a better chance at online learning than attending school. Staying home may feel like the right choice, but in the future it will not be. Depending on their line of work, socializing could be required, a skill they were not able to attain.

To also disagree with distance learning, students will not be able to receive the same personal understanding and knowledge. Teachers are able to educate their students on a personal level, to their own understanding. Growing up I was always always shy to present in frontÂ of a class and would always try to find a way out of it. It was never seen as a problem to myself, but my teacher knew it was something I would have to learn how to get comfortable with. In class presentations became a weekly activity just to boost the students confidence. A young boy named Generic_Name could never get to school on time which the teacher knew would effect him negatively in the future. However, he helped Generic_Name through the process to arriving to school on time and he recently received an award for being the most punctual at work. Help is always available in school, but it is hard to tell who needs it through a screen.

Therefore, with distance learning, we are limiting those essential building blocks that can not be received online. Generic_Name, a lyrical genius, once stated,"" hands on experience is the best experience."" Physically being apart of school is the best way to be apart of school. While in school, online or physically, it will consist of drawbacks and uncontrollable complications, but those situations can be much more assuring with other people around to provide advice and more help.

We dont have to put ourselves in an unconfortable situation because it won't help us to get the succes that we want. It just going to help us to go through the way of failure. Not all the time going to be easy. We must have to fail a lot of time, it help us to see what we are doing wrong, and what we have to change to get what we want. We just have to keep going with enthusiasm and believe in ourselves. The sucess help to the people to be someone in life.

We can see in our everyday how hard is life, and how we have to strive ourselves to get the sucess, but we can see that there are obstacles and we have to know how to pass through it. Life is hard, but nothing is imposible if we have already planned what we want. Sometimes we dont get the result on what we have been worked. But nothing can be hard at all, we have to know that all is posible, we dont have to take it as imposible. One example that we can see in our everday are the students in the university. Not all of them have the support of the family to cover the cost to pay the the clas in the university. Some of them have to work to get the money and pay their study. Some of them have to fail because it's not easy to do at lot of things at the same time, but we can see that they keep going through it, doesn't matter what. To get the sucess we have to work and just focuss on what we want. At the end we can see the result. We must have to fail a lot of time, but we have to have in mind that we can do it. The people who graduate, at the end they remember how hard it was. But they believed in theirselves and also keeped their head up with enthusiasm, and learned of each mistake that they had done in the way to the sucess.

Other example can be the student from other country in high school, at the end of each year the student have to do a test of each subjet they have. But is not easy fo them because not all of them speak english, they have to learn a lot and out themselves in a hard situation to do it. They have to effort a lot themselves, some of them have to fail like three time to pass the test. But they know that nothing is imposible if they believe in themselves. They know that they have to take tests to graduate, we can see the hispanic student in Generic_School, they have to take the ESOL test each year but they have to study a lot because their first language that they know is spanish, and they just have been in this country in a little while. For some of them the situation is hard, but at the end we can see them in their way to graduate and how proud they are of themselves because it's not easy to learn english.

Also, we can see the organizations that want to help to the people who doesn't have nothing, they have to do a lot of thing and have to be prepare because no one know if they gonna get what they want. The goverment and other institutions have to aprove the organization and one of the best examples is Shakira and her fundation ''Pies Descalso"", she wants to help to the children with the eduation, and alimentation. She had to do a concert to get the money to start with her fundation, she has been in hard situation but she always believed in herself. We can see today how she had changed the life of millions of children around the world, how bennefitted with education and alimentation they are. child from poor families are now someone in life, some of them are in the university. All can be hard but never imposible. She accomplish her dream, doesn't matter what. In her way, were obstacle and difficults things. But she didn't give up because of that.

She tried to raise her grades up, but she was stressed. Now, they still let her play unless she keeps her grades up. I want to bring students to an assembly and talk to them how much sports really mean to us. That grades and homework could be our number one priority. That we should still participate in sports with a grade C

average.

I would want to make a petition, so that students can support our cause and sign it. That its not fair that the things we love to do is being taken away. I think a lot of students and their parents would agree with me. Nothing could stop me from doing the petition. I wouldn't care what the principle or teacher would say. I would keep on pushing and pushing.

That's why I'm against the new policy change, because it wouldn't be fair for the student",0,persuade_corpus,,9

So, you know, doing your best to solve a problem is like, super important. I mean, think about it. When you put in effort and try your hardest, you're more likely to achieve your goals and stuff. Like, if you're trying to get good grades, you're gonna do better in class if you put in the effort to learn the material. And if you're trying to solve a problem with your friends, you're gonna find a solution faster if you put in the effort to listen to their perspectives and come up with a plan.

I know from personal experience that doing your best to solve a problem can make a huge difference. Like, last year I was trying to solve a math problem for homework, and I was totally stuck. But I didn't give up. I kept trying different methods and asking my friends for help until I finally figured it out. And it felt so good when I finally got it right! 

Another example is when my little brother was having trouble with his science project. He was trying to build a volcano, but it wasn't working right. So I helped him brainstorm ideas and we worked together to figure it out. And we finally got it to work! It was so cool to see him be so proud of himself. 

And let's not forget about all the famous people who have achieved great things by putting in the effort to solve problems. Like, did you know that Thomas Edison failed over a thousand times before he invented the light bulb?! That's like, totally mind-blowing!  If he had given up after the first few tries, we wouldn't have light bulbs today! 

So yeah, doing your best to solve a problem is super important. It shows that you're determined and willing to put in the effort to achieve your goals. And who knows, you might even come up with a solution that changes the world! 

Anyway, that's my essay. I hope you liked it!  Thanks for reading!",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay discussing why it is important to do your best to solve a problem. Support your arguments by providing examples of personal experiences or well-known anecdotes.,8
8A3392CDCCF1,"Why are summer projects student-designed instead of being teacher-designed? They are designed for students to learn about a specific subject that could teach them about a lot of things that they haven't heard about before doing the project. Student-designed summer projects represents new information, the amount of time it has been worked on, and the possibility of helping the society. Summer projects will help a student during their summer break to keep learning new things in the world and develop facts about them.

Firstly, student-designed summer projects shows new information to students rather than a teacher. A teacher taught themselves to know the knowledge that a student would need in their future life, so making a project would increase the knowledge of a student. Projects during the summer break could actually help a student to remember everything that they learned and teach others about it to where people will learn new things in their life. When a student is able to give people details about what they learned during the summer, it would be added to the brain of the person to know what to do or how to do something. Information given from a student would stay in their mind for a long time to recollect, but a person will try to prove them wrong, so that they will get the point of the argument until the student is able to show the facts that they are the correct individual. Students collect facts of their subject and study them to show to the teacher of how much new information has helped them in knowing something they didn't know before working on the project.

Secondly, student-designed summer projects shows the amount of time the student has been working on making the project. Timing of a project can represent how determined a student wants to learn about a new subject, so they could use all of the facts and put it into their project. If a student is taking days to weeks to finish the project they are going to make a spectacular presentation to the students and the teacher that will give them an extra boost in their knowledge. A student that takes only a day to work on their project wouldn't care about the facts they learn, even though it is important to learn everything that they need to learn to be smarter with facts that could come in their future. It shouldn't take a long time for a student to work on their project and not finish it in time to where they don't have the information, and it will show how irresponsible the student can be of not working on their project.

The project should be filled with real information to where students can use it and transfer it to other students brain as they would have the possibility of taking a test or quiz on the information that was given to them. Testing or taking a quiz on a subject that the student have done a project on should be easy for all the students who learned a new fact.

Thirdly, student-designed summer project helps society to do better and not make it worse to where it will become a deserted area or bad society. A summer project about helping society would influence people to care for their society to always clean it instead of trashing the area making it look dirty that no one wants to come near it and help people, so that nothing bad will happen to their society and no one will make it a bad area. Society creates a place to where Americans can be comfortable around each other having them to express their emotions publicly and getting the attention of people to care about them. It also creates a space to where people wouldn't like it based on the people that lives there having it to be seen as a bad society that no one who wants to live in a good society would consider to live or visit in that area. Americans can help society from becoming a bad society and a deserted area by taking care of the area and citizens who are in need of help before they make the society to be bad. If the society becomes to be not a good society everyone who lived there would leave and decide to live in a bigger area that has a better society.

However, teacher-designed summer project will give the teacher the same information that they already knew before, but a student-designed summer project would actually teach the students new information of their subject during the summer. When a student is doing a project during the summer it would be intriguing to the students to keep learning and show everything they have in their brain to offer to other students improving their knowledge too. Teachers are able to learn the information as they study hard to give the students the same information, so a student should be able to do the same thing and achieve a better grade for their summer project. Student-designed summer projects can show their capability of getting the facts and information of their subject to where they would gain ideas on how to make their project connect to other students mindset on it.

In Conclusion, summer projects are required to be student-designed to help students to learn new information and develop facts in the world. It teaches the students new information, the amount of time the project has to be done, and a way of helping their society to know in their future life. Summer projects are a good requirement for students to learn new things during their summer break.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

ONLINE CLASSES ARE BETTER THAN GOIING TO SCHOOL.

Talking online classes are way easier and better then attending/going to school. Some schools offer distance leaning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If students get this opportunity to take their classes online, ''I'' think it will be a good idea and they will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, Because Many students can't be at for many reasons,they can be sick or injured. Two, online classes help to students to take class at anytime they want . Three, online classes save students more time and money.

Many students can't be at school for many reasons, for example the student can be sick or injured. So the student getting the opportunity for taking or getting his/her work done on online classes will make it easier for the student, instead of students going to school when they're sick or Injured. So a sick student can stay at home and get his/her work done so they wouldn't be to spread the sickness or the disease around the school. And it can prevent people from getting sick too.

Online classes are easier because, students can take the class at anytime they want and do what every they want do after the class. For example Students get a job and make some money to pay for school fees and bills and also they can support their family with the money. And they can take the class after work or before work on online. Also online classes makes it easier for students who have jobs and the same time going/attending school.

Moreover, online classes can save students some money and time. Because driving to school everyday is a waste of gas, money and time. Students can save that money for gas and do something else with, for example they can pay bills with that money or even they can support they're family with money. In some cases the student can have family ''(kids and wife)'' and online classes can help the student to spread more time with his/her family.

In conclusion,

schools offering distance leaning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This opportunity will help students in so many ways. Students will get more time to get they're work done on time and also save money for them self. The students can do whatever they want to after taking the class on online ( spreading time with family and having fun).

F95D5E35B4C1,"The use of Facial Action Coding System could be a good thing to use in school. It also can be used for help better how teacher do things. At can also help a pyschologist find students with problems or mental issues. Another good use for it is could help the students in there ability to act in acting classes.

First reason why it could be a good thing for schools is that you can use the system to check if the students are bored or confused, so you can change how a teacher teaches in a different style. It also could change how the students learn. In the text I says this '' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'' It would be good to use to help students learn what are some of facial expression and learning what muscle cause that movement.

Another reason why it would be good to use the system is to use in acting class. A lot of school have classes such as acting, drama, and threater. How this would benfit a student is it would help then try to get the facial expression that they would need for a certain part in acting or in play it also and help produce emotions. In paragraph 9 it says this '' according to the facial feedback theory emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotion but it aslo may even help produce them.'' Then it goes on to say ''constantin stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way to createing these emtions on stage''.

Finally another reason why it would be good to use the facial coding system is it would help the school psychologists if there is a student is having problems and they are hiding their problems . If would help alert the pyschologist if they are going threw depression or suicidal thoughts. it would help the pyschologist so they find a way to make them happy so they do good in school and keep track of what they are doing. In paragraph 5 it says this '' you van probably tell how a friend is felling simply by the look on her face. Of course most of us would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried etc.''

So with conclusion these are some the reason why it would be good to use Facial Action Coding System. It would be for schools to think about these option and what it can do for students. Thank you for your taking your time to read this. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
86245BB1A314,"Does one truly need a classroom to learn about the world around them? For the last few decades, one couldn't imagine school life without thinking of the classrooms they spent hours in everyday. Turning every year into a busy pattern of learning as more and more children are placed into the school system. At one point in time, this wouldn't have been an issue. But now, as the student body at school grows larger, teachers lack the time to focus on every student. Causing students who are going through medical issues or needing extra help falling through the cracks. This leaves the question, how do we support the students who need extra help outside the classroom? Through online, long distance learning, students gain the ability to learn from home. Online classes leads to strong benefits because it helps injured students continue their studies, supporting those who need extra help, and showing them how to manage their time.

When a student is injured, catching up on what they missed in school can be more stressful the injury itself at the time. Many students being forced to restart the full semester for something out of their control. Wasting the time they already placed into the class. However, with online schooling, students are able to work from home. Giving them a chance to catch up without needing someone to give them every worksheet the teacher might have given out. With this, once the student returns to class, they should have limited issues with the new topics being taught in class.

As the amount of students slowly grow, teachers have to limit the one on one focus they give to each student, but with online learning can get the extra help they need. During class, many teachers don't have the time to help a student if the rest of the class is ready to continue. Students giving up trying to learn the subject at all. This is where online schooling would come in. Outside of class, through video conferencing, a teacher can get a chance to fully go over any questions the student may have. Even tests are possible in this method. The teacher being able to watch the student complete the questions while correcting them on the way. All of this leading to better students and better grades over time.

Some people may argue that, without a teacher, students would not complete their work. Possibly allowing themselves to fail in favor of playing a video game or sleeping. Without outside control, it is easy to understand why one would think that. However, just because school is online doesn't mean there aren't punishments. Not only should a student's guardian be able to keep the student from slacking off, but teachers as well. Just because the schooling would be online it doesn't mean the student can't be punished. Time management is a very important thing for everyone to learn and online school is a great way to teach it. Forcing a student to understand if they don't plan, they will face the repercussions.

With students having the ability to work from home injured students and those who need extra help are able to continueÂ their studies while also learning to manage their time. For those injured, online schooling gives them the chance to keep up with their studies while they are healing. For students needing extra help, teachers could video conference from home, allowing the studentÂ to ask questions they need to. And, even if students aren't observed as much at home, that doesn't change the fact the student with face punishments for slacking off for no reason. In conclusion, I believe online learning is something both students and teachers need. For the sake of our schools and the sake of our future.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

C594B85513B6,"Do you want to be stressed out because you're trying to focus on two things? Not me! I would not be able to sleep at night.

If you raise the bar to play sports to a B grade average, almost half of the school will not be playing sports. Also I don't think that's a good idea because a student is bound to start lacking in school or sports.

I'm sure that you don't want to have a school full of kids that are going to get stressed out because they're trying to focus on school when really he or she is supposed to be practicing for a sport. Just think about it for a moment. You would be hurting many students dreams of becoming a famous sport player, but they can't because they did not have enough time as a child to practice. For instance, say their is a kid that is very talented in sports and has a strong chance of getting a scholarship. But the student grades are average.

Sadly, the student does not have a B average and can't participate in the sport that he wants to play. Now you would've ruined his chance of ever becoming a famous sport star.

Lastly, students will not be able to have fun in school. If you want a B grade point average you must work hard. That means sleepless night of studying. Do you want you're students to come to school dragging and falling asleep in class because they had practice and a lot of studying to do. But see why this could an good idea.

My first reason to join the UNRRA program is becuase you get to help other people in other countries that are in need for help or care. The UNRRA helpes people from Europe to China and give them stuff like food, water, and other things becuase of the war that happened in Europe which we call World War 2.

My second reason why you should join the UNRRA program is becuase that you get to see other countries or cities that aren't pausible to travel on foot, car, or train. You can get to see other counties like China, Greece, Crete, and even Panama Canal for a matter of fact.

My last reason to why you should join the UNRRA program is that there's fun activeities on the UNRRA ship to do.

darragh_claude_v7_41,"I disagree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurriculars provide benefits, forcing participation ignores individual circumstances and can place undue burden on some students. 

Not all students have the time or ability to commit to extracurricular activities. Some students need to work part-time jobs or help care for family members after school. Mandating extracurricular participation would unfairly punish these students who have justifiable reasons for not participating. It could also negatively impact their academic performance if the added workload from required extracurriculars is too much. 

Personality and interests also vary greatly between individuals. Extracurricular activities will not appeal equally to all students. Forcing participation in activities they do not genuinely want to do risks creating resentment and half-hearted involvement. It is better to allow students choice in selecting activities that fit their talents and motivations in order to achieve maximum engagement and benefit.

Instead of a mandate, the school should encourage extracurricular involvement through promoting the opportunities available and recognizing participation. However, students should have the individual freedom to decide whether or not extracurricular activities can realistically fit into their circumstances and desires. Not all learning happens inside the classroom, but students learn valuable life lessons through managing their own schedules and priorities as well. The principal's intention to promote well-rounded development is admirable, but a mandate is not the most effective or considerate way to achieve that goal.",1,darragh_claude_v7,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

llama_70b_v1484,"Standardized testing has been a controversial topic in the educational system for a long time. While some people argue that it is an effective way to measure student ability, others claim that it is not an accurate measure. In my opinion, standardized tests are not a perfect measure of student ability.

Firstly, these tests are often biased towards certain groups of students. For instance, students from low-income families may not have access to the same resources and opportunities as their peers from more affluent backgrounds. This means that they may not perform as well on the test, not because they are less intelligent, but because they have not had the same opportunities to prepare. Additionally, students who are English language learners may struggle with the language barrier, which can affect their performance on the test.

Secondly, standardized tests only measure a narrow aspect of intelligence. They focus primarily on multiple-choice questions that assess memorization and basic comprehension skills. However, there are many other important skills that are not captured by these tests, such as critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. This means that students who excel in these areas may not receive the recognition they deserve.

Furthermore, standardized tests can be stressful and anxiety-inducing for students. The pressure to perform well can lead to mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. This can affect students' ability to focus and learn, which can ultimately impact their academic performance.

Lastly, there are better alternatives to standardized testing. For example, project-based assessments allow students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in a more hands-on way. This type of assessment can provide a more comprehensive picture of a student's abilities, as it takes into account their critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.

In conclusion, while standardized tests may have been useful in the past, they are not an accurate measure of student ability today. They are biased, narrow, stressful, and can have negative impacts on students' mental health. Therefore, it is important to consider alternative forms of assessment that can provide a more comprehensive picture of a student's abilities. By doing so, we can ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to succeed and reach their full potential.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The use of standardized testing in schools has been a topic of debate for many years.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and advocate against the idea of changing to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College plays a crucial role in maintaining our democratic process and upholding the principles on which our founding fathers established this nation.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. With the winner-take-all system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, providing a clear and decisive outcome. As witnessed in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. This system minimizes the likelihood of a disputed election and provides a stable framework for the American people.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it ensures that every region of the country has a say in the presidential election. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This forces candidates to campaign across the nation, appealing to voters from different backgrounds and perspectives. It ensures that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to win the presidency and that all Americans feel represented in the highest office.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This system gives a voice to the most thoughtful voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states and neglecting the concerns and issues of smaller states.

The Electoral College also balances the political power between large and small states. The system restores weight to large states that may otherwise lose their influence due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. For instance, in the 2012 election, Florida, with its close popular vote, received 29 electoral votes, while a comparable victory in Wyoming would only yield 3 electoral votes. This balance allows candidates to address the concerns of both small and large states, ensuring a more equitable representation of the American people.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In scenarios where no candidate secures a majority in the popular vote, the Electoral College guarantees the selection of a clear winner. Run-off elections would complicate the presidential election process and may lead to further division among the electorate. The Electoral College acts as a safeguard to ensure a definite outcome and avoid prolonged electoral disputes.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic process. It facilitates certainty of outcome, represents the interests of all regions and states, encourages candidates to campaign widely, balances the political power between large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. While some argue for a popular vote system, it is essential to remember that the Electoral College has served us well for over two centuries and maintains the integrity of our elections.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages of the Electoral College in making decisions regarding this matter.

E7BA64F54715,"Distractions while driving could lead to deaths of other civilians. There are reasons why this topic became an actual law. The law was just passed last year that is you're on your phone while driving, that is an immediate ticket. Due to your criminal record (if it's bad) you can even do jail time if you feel you do not apply to this law. The cops of our cities are doing their job by stopping people who does not follow this law.

The main reason why this show not be condoned is, because most of these situations a citizen could get in a car accident. Approximately 1.6 million citizens die due to being on their cell phone while operating a vehicle. Nearly 390,000 people get real serious injuries due to texting and driving. One out of four of every car accident in the United States are due to texting and driving. In my opinion I believe texting and driving is the main reason we have so many deaths every year.

In conclusion, texting and driving needs to be/ stay illegal. That way people will not do it so often, which could decrease the death rate each year. Texting and driving could possibly be the reason why our death rates increase over time. Especially in this day and age, because almost everything now is technology based. In addition, I believe that texting and driving is not safe for yourself or others, so technology should be the last thing you are on while behind and active vehicle. Texts, calls, emails all can wait until you are in a secure place (not behind the wheel) to respond, and also that way nobody could die or have an injury                                          ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
FF410031A764,"Does your school have extracurricular activities? Are you in any of them? Most schools in America have extracurricular activities on or off school grounds. The problem is that more than 50 percent of students dont engage in those activities. My principal wants that to change he is making extracurricular activities mandatory and i agree. 3 reasons are extracurricular activities can be fun, they give students a wider career path, and they can keep students open minded. I will explain why extracurricular activities can be fun, how they widen students career paths, and how they keep students open minded.

For my first reason, extracurricular activities can be fun. For example when i first entered sixth grade i had nothing to do. I was not in any sports and i wasnt engaged in extracurricular activities. That all changed when my friend convinced me to join soccer, my life changed for the better. I never knew how fun soccer was and i probably never would have if it wasnt for him. Students think that just because somthing looks boring it is boring, that is not always true and it can be the exact opposite.

For my second reason, extracurricular activities can widen a student career path. It can happen in two ways, the student discovers they have a hidden talent or they can find somthing they really like to do. When i was in seventh grade i had a friend who was really good at photography. You would never see him or his camera seperated from each other. So one day i told him about the yearbook club and he thought it would be great if he joined. He was so good at it he became the vice-president of the club within weeks. Ever since that day he has tried to get a career in photography.

For my third and final reason, extracurricular activities can keep students open minded. For example when i was in fifth grade my school got a number of sports introduced to it and tennis was one of them. I was already into basketball and i was never interested in tennis. I played basketball at home and not at school so when the school said all students must pick one sport i picked basketball. They didnt let me because there was already to many people so i picked tennis. I did not want to try somthing new but i didnt have a choice. When i went to my first practice i loved it, I never thought it would be this fun. Being in a new sport really made me experience somthing else and from that day i ws never afraid to change.

People may disagree but extracurricular activities are amazing. I explained how they can be fun, how they can change students career paths, and they can keep students open minded. Many people dont know how fun it is to be in an extracurricular activity and i encourage people to join one. now you know why i agree with our principal and how his opinion can change people for the better.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
8EB73A991757,"Some schools believe in summer projects, the purpose of these projects are to assure that students continue to learn during summer break. Classes should be challenged to design their own project, this will challenge the student to design a complex project that is guaranteed to stay a topic of interest. Students should poses a checklist that details what the project needs. Teachers can provide examples for the class to reference if they become puzzled on a part of their task. Upon completion the teacher would receive an email verifying that the student finished the task.

Say if the project is for history the teacher can choose the time period they want and the student will find a topic. For example the teacher wants the project to be in the 2000's, the student could then choose to write about wars in the Middle-East. Therefore the topic is relevant to what the teacher wants and the student is interested in his or her research. The person working on the task can write about why the war happened, who started the war, and when the war ended. After the student finishes, the work will be emailed to the history teacher and would be graded.

If a teacher dictated the project the student would not have much interest in the work. The student would lose interest and stop working on it or would score low on the work. Loss of interest may result in the student not learning anything over summer. If someone holds interest in a subject they will retain the information they researched, and can possible continue to understand and research that object or subject. Which would result in learning something new over summer break.

Some teachers might say why give the student control on the project? Well if a student controlled their work they would be able to let their imagination flow, allowing them to discover their personality and learn about how they think and work best. The student would most likely choose something they want to learn more about. They can also choose something that appeals to their interests. For someone to learn something they must choose what appeals to them and build knowledge through research. That is why a student should be able to choose their summer project and not be told what to do work on.

Some students are required to do school projects over summer. Schools say it benefits the student and expands their knowledge. Schools should let the students choose and design their project. Student choice would assure that they learn something new over summer break. Teachers should provide examples and checklist to help the student work and continue to learn over the course of summer break.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
EC347BE5ADE4,"An Essay on Summer Projects

Summer break for students is easily the best time of the year. Summer is time to have fun, enjoy the little things, and get into new hobbies. Unfortunately, these lighthearted and laid-back couple of months are marred by the mandatory summer projects assigned by their teachers. Instead of spending their time going to museums and looking at fossils, or rockets, or anything interesting to them, they're forced to do papers on old British novels about daily life in Victorian England. Instead of allowing these students to pick their direction in life, they're shaped into squares through the way that they're taught to follow instructions. Students should be able to design their own summer projects, to not only continue their learning throughout the summer, but to also inspire individuality, creativity, and even a sense of direction in life.

First, on the nature of summer projects. Summer projects are assigned for a few reasons. They attempt to ensure that students are doing some kind of learning over the summer. They also attempt to ensure that students do not forget how to learn. As for the successÂ of this method, I am unsure, so I cannot say whether or not these projects are useless wastes of time for most students. On the other hand, in my experience, the few students who were told to do a project but instead blew it off, choosing to spend their summer time as they wished, tended to then also spend their time during the school year ignoring their responsibilities as a student. Those who did their work over the summer were more likely to be responsible students, making genuine attempts to learn in school. Through this correlation, one can assume that summer projects positively impact a student's education. Of course, correlation does not equal causation, but it does follow a clear trend.

Now onto my main assertions. By allowing students to direct and design their own projects, students will have to take time thinking of topics that they would want to work on, giving them an opportunity to develop a sense of self and consider their own interests. Time for introspection and the considering of options for the future are often skipped in schools, and the entirely open-endedÂ nature of a student-designed project would be possibly a better learning experience than doing a regular project on it's own.

Students don't often get chances to exercise creativity during school. The only possible outlets are fine arts classes, creative writing, and the rare, ever-elusive, enjoyable project. An ""enjoyable project"" entails choices, certain liberties, and a chance to express yourself through your work. Research is still required, the learning still happens, yet it's an all-around more pleasant experience. While it might be easier for teachers to grade carbon-copy research papers on a choice between three topics, it's not nearly as interesting as grading projects on a variety of topics in a wide variety of formats. Giving the students an opportunity to get to show what kind of person they are and their interests helps give purpose to the projects, and teachers get interesting introductions to their new students. Through this opening of options, not only will the students still learn during the summer, but it becomes a positive experience for both student and teacher.

Through contemplation and research, students are given an opportunity to find something they're passionate about. This can be crucial for a student's development as a person, giving them something to think about and study for.

For example, if a student finds that they're somehow incredibly interested in the formation of lichen, they can load up on science classes and take high-level biology and environmental sciences and eventually become someone who studies lichen to make a living. And that's what school is all about. School aims to get people interested in learning more, and to prepare people to find a career they enjoy and can make a living off of. That'd be quite the productive summer project. An opportunity like that inspires learning much more than, say, reading an old book about a couple of cities and writing a paper on it.

None of this is to say that the project can't have limits, or minimum requirements, of course.

A very rough guideline is necessary to ensure that people aren't hypothetically turning in a project consisting of no more than seven dead mice stapled to a posterboard, claiming that they did hours of research to find out that mouse traps do indeed work as intended. Instead, students should be expected to show their research process, include citations for their sources, and provide annotations or commentary on why and how the mice died. Projects can not be productive if there aren't certain rules and procedures. The issue with teacher-directed projects is that there is no limit to the limitations they can put in place. If the project is meant to encourage students to learn over the summer, why should it be restricted to just a few certain topics? There shouldn't be limits set on a student's learning. Summer projects are meant to benefit the students the most, so why should they be held back from their full potential?",0,persuade_corpus,,2

I find it very unfair that students need a grade B average to participate in School sports and activities! First of all, what if kids are really good at sports but don't have a grade B average, we need them for our school's reputation, what if only grade A and B average students who are really bad at sports participate in sports activities? This will surely embarrass our school reputation. and also some students under grade B average sometimes freak out about this new policy. We really need to cancel this new, unfair Policy! Also what about the activities!? What if students Are really good at playing the violin and are under grade B average? They will also freak out about it! They'll freak out about the fact that the cant do anything but look for a new hobby! I assure you, that on the day of the school concert, half of the people will leave. Why you ask? Because, maybe some people don't remember how to play the violin! now i think your asking how. Well if your policy is like that, people will have to focus their minds on grades and homework!!!!!! So imagine that new policy, embarrassing yourself and the school! So why not?

Go ahead, embarrass the school! Its not our problem, its yours! All the students disagree, all the faculty agree! Its now Students v. s. Faculty. ALL the students disagree on this policy.

Even some parents disagree. We students just want to play sports and instruments without having to worry about grades. Thank you for your time.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

The reason for this is because some people do not have a good outlook on things so they look for others that can give them the right advice.

Also; getting advice puts less pressure on a person for they do not have to think as much.Â I for one believe that getting advice is helpful especially since there is so much to give. A person could get advice from anyone about anything and its helpful because so many others are looking for the same thing.

And why is it good that u ask other people for their opinion is because it can help people feel good about theirselvs and what i mean by that is most of the time no one cares about your opinion or theres and asking them for their opinion can really impact their life a lotÂ because you probably brighten their day by putting a smile on their face.

Another way it help is that it improves your ability to talk to other people, say if your shy and dont talk to nobody try going around asking people for their opinion on something and you ask how that can improve your ability to talk to people well it improves your ability to talk to peopleÂ without being scared it really works because the more you do it the less afraid you are to talk to people.

And also asking for other people opinions can help you make friends because when you ask for their opinion they probably want to ask you a question or they probably was thinking about the same question you asked but didnt have anyone to ask because they dont have friends either and now yall are friends and more friends are better than one.

so thats why i think asking multiple people for their opinion is better than just asking one person because it can help you get friends, improve your ability to talk to people,and it makes them fool good about themselves.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
darragh_claude_v7_8,"Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Driving

In today's technology driven world, cell phones have become virtually indispensable. However, the widespread use of cell phones while driving has become a major safety concern and should be banned. There are several key reasons for this:

First and foremost, cell phone use significantly increases distractions behind the wheel. Whether dialing a number, texting, or browsing the internet, these activities take a driver's eyes off the road for prolonged periods. Numerous studies have shown that even hands-free use of a cell phone leads to lapses in attention and slower reaction times similar to drunken driving. The brain can only focus on one task at a time, so any phone conversation splits driving performance. 

Second, cell phone use is a direct factor in an alarming number of crashes each year. Statistical data reveals cell phone interactions as a primary cause of thousands of accidents causing injuries and deaths that could have been avoided. Texting poses one of the greatest risks, as it requires taking both hands off the wheel and eyes off the road. But even merely talking or listening to a call increases the likelihood of collision.

Finally, prohibiting cell phone use establishes a clear standard and protects all motorists. If permitted, exceptions and ambiguities around ""hands-free"" devices will remain problematic and unenforceable. Driving is a complex task that requires full attention to myriad variables like traffic conditions and road signs. Shifting even part of one's focus to a phone deprives them of the undivided concentration necessary to drive responsibly and react effectively in emergencies. 

In summary, the dangers of cell phone distracted driving far outweigh any perceived convenience or necessity. A total ban provides the simplest and most effective policy to curb this entirely preventable epidemic and save lives on our roads. The small sacrifice of not using a phone will have large benefits for public safety. For these compelling reasons, drivers should not be permitted cell phone use of any kind while operating a vehicle.",1,darragh_claude_v7,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

E5C9AD14EB2D,"Advice is a form of guidance or direction given by someone with more experience or knowledge to help someone make a better decision. It can come from a variety of sources, including family, friends, mentors, and experts. While advice can be helpful, it can also be misleading or harmful if not used wisely.

One of the benefits of advice is that it can provide a fresh perspective on a problem or decision. For example, if a student is struggling with a difficult class, they may seek advice from a teacher or tutor. The teacher or tutor may offer insights and strategies that the student may not have considered before. This can lead to a better understanding of the material and ultimately better grades.

However, advice can also be limiting or restrictive. For example, if a student is considering a career change, they may seek advice from family or friends who have successful careers in their current field. While this advice may be well-intentioned, it may not take into account the student's personal interests or strengths. This can lead to a decision that is not the best fit for the student.

Additionally, advice can be biased or influenced by the adviser's own experiences or beliefs. For example, a teacher may give advice based on their own experiences with a particular subject, but this may not necessarily be the best advice for a student who has a different learning style or background.

Despite these potential drawbacks, advice can be a valuable tool when used appropriately. One way to use advice effectively is to seek out a variety of perspectives. For example, if a student is considering a career change, they may seek advice from a career counselor, a mentor in the field they are interested in, and even someone who has had a completely different career. This can help the student get a well-rounded understanding of the options available to them.

Another way to use advice effectively is to approach it with an open mind. While advice can be helpful, it is ultimately up to the individual to make their own decisions. It is important to listen to advice, but also to consider it carefully and make a decision that is based on the individual's own values and goals.

In conclusion, advice can be a valuable tool for making better decisions, but it is important to use it appropriately. Seeking out a variety of perspectives and approaching advice with an open mind can",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,2
03f91f9e2282_04112023,"While technology to identify human emotions could have some benefits in a classroom setting, there are also significant risks that raise ethical concerns. On one hand, the Facial Action Coding System described in the article aims to give teachers additional insights into how students are feeling in the classroom. If implemented carefully, it could help teachers understand levels of engagement, confusion, or other emotional states that traditional academic assessments do not always capture. This extra awareness of the student experience might allow for improved instructional methods or additional support. 

However, there are also reasonable doubts about constantly monitoring students' facial expressions without their knowledge or consent. Emotions are complex and personal, and subtle facial cues could be misinterpreted without understanding the full context of what inspired them. Continuous recording and analysis of students risks invading their privacy and reducing their feelings of autonomy or privacy. It may distort the natural relationship between teacher and student if facial coding is relied upon too heavily rather than direct communication. Students deserve to learn and grow in an environment where they feel respected and comfortable expressing a range of reactions without fear of surveillance.

Overall, while facial coding technology aimed at improving education could have benefits, the potential downsides pertaining to student privacy, consent, and well-being appear to outweigh those benefits given existing constraints. More research exploring appropriate applications and sensitive implementation would be needed to address ethical issues before widespread use in classrooms is advisable. The emotional experiences of students learning are best understood through human relationships based on trust, not impersonal monitoring systems, particularly at their current stages of development.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,2

B32F41984B27,"The Advantages and Disadvantages of Online High School Classes

In recent years, online high school classes have become increasingly popular. While some students may prefer the traditional classroom setting, there are several benefits to online classes that should be considered. In this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of online high school classes and examine the options available for students who are academically advanced and those who need extra help with their classes.

One of the main advantages of online high school classes is the flexibility they offer. Students can complete their coursework at their own pace, which is particularly beneficial for those who have other commitments such as sports or extracurricular activities. Additionally, online classes often offer a wider range of courses than traditional classrooms, allowing students to pursue their interests and passions.

However, there are also several disadvantages to online high school classes. One of the main drawbacks is the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. This can make it difficult for students to ask questions and receive feedback on their work. Additionally, online classes often require a high level of self-discipline and motivation, which can be challenging for some students.

Options for Advanced and Struggling Students

For students who are academically advanced, online classes can offer a more challenging and engaging learning experience. These classes often offer more advanced coursework and opportunities for independent study. On the other hand, for students who are struggling with their classes, online classes can offer extra support and resources. These classes often offer more individualized attention from teachers and additional resources such as online tutoring and study guides.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Online Middle School Classes

The decision to offer online middle school classes is a complex one. On the one hand, online classes can offer the same benefits as those for high school students, including flexibility and a wider range of courses. However, middle school students may not be mature enough to handle the self-discipline and responsibility required for online classes. Additionally, online classes may not offer the same level of social interaction as traditional classrooms, which is particularly important for middle school students who are developing their social skills.

8F8B11DD9ACC,"BOO! BOO! Cried the Generic_SchoolÂ students when they found out they have to complete a summer project over break in order to assure they do not forget all of the material they have learned over the school year. However, what these students do not know is that they are not the only students that have to complete this project. Various schools have adopted this strategy and there has been a debate about whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Letting students design their summer projects could be an extravagant opportunity because students would have an opportunity to be creative, however, teachers should be in charge of the summer projects because teachers have more knowledge on their subject than the students, more experience with lesson planning, and can also construct projects that can be fun and enjoyable for students.

To start off, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have more knowledge about their subject than students. For example, by the end of the school year many students have already forgot most of what they have learned over the past school year. On the other hand, teachers teach their subject material over and over again for years at a time. Teachers know their subject like the back of their hands, where as, students are just learning this material and still have much more to learn. Another reason would be that students often have a hard time remembering the material they learned at the beginning of the school year because students have work upon work piled onto them with every class that they take. Once the students learn one unit teachers move onto a different unit and eventually by the end of the year students have so much information crammed into their brains that they can have a hard time keeping up. This is why teachers should take it upon themselves to plan the summer projects for students.

Additionally, teachers have more experience with lesson planning. The job of a teacher is to come up with different lesson plans and strategies for their students to assure they obtain all the information they need. Students are not educated on how to teach other students. Students may be able to come up with a summer project but between the students and the teachers the teachers would have a better project idea because that is their job to have effective projects. Teachers know what strategies work for helping students obtain knowledge. It would be irresponsible to allow students to come up with their own project. Any typical student would not be thrilled about the idea of having a summer project so if students were given the opportunity to construct their own assignment then they would make it to where they would not have to do as much work. However, teachers would guarantee that their project plan would work for their students.

Furthermore, teachers have the ability to construct projects that are fun and enjoyable for students. Although there may be a selective group of teachers who typically would not have hands on and enjoyable projects, majority of teachers could construct a fun summer project for students. Whether the project is to visit a certain historical figure and take notes or to raise awareness for any person in need. Some teachers who are experienced and have worked with students for years at a time are aware of what students are capable of. If a student is motivated enough and has the right resources then they can achieve any project assigned to them. Teachers would also have to keep in mind that every students is different and has different resources and limits.

To conclude, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers are more knowledgeable than students about their subject, they have effective lesson planning strategies for students, and have the ability to make any project enjoyable for students. There is nothing wrong with assigning students summer projects to make sure that students remember all the material of the past year. Students forgetting material over a set amount of time is not uncommon. As long as these summer projects are fun and not stressful on students then the students will remember their summer for years to come.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Take the light blob for example. It's a weird thing, but it's a great example of determination. Scientists were trying to create a new type of battery, but it kept failing. They were about to give up when they realized they could use the blob to help them. It turned out to be a great conductor of electricity! If they had given up, we wouldn't have that cool new battery.

Enthusiasm is super important when trying to reach a goal. If you don't care about what you're doing, you're less likely to keep going when things get tough. When you're excited about something, you're more motivated to keep trying.

But, what if you're not excited about something? What if you're just doing it because you have to? Well, that's when it's important to find your passion. When you're doing something you love, you're more likely to keep going even when things get tough.

Sometimes, people will try to bring you down by giving you negative feedback. They might tell you that you can't do something, or that you're not good enough. But, you shouldn't let them get to you! Just ignore them and keep going.

So, the next time you're feeling discouraged, remember Winston Churchill's quote. Keep going, even when things don't go right. And, find your passion! It's the key to success. And, don't let anyone bring you down with their negative feedback. You got this!",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

454FA9C8E4C0,"Some of the students that go to school do not enjoy doing extracurricular activities. I do not agree with the princapal's decision of making it mandatory for students to take an extracurricular activity because, students should have the decision of whetherÂ or not they want to take an extracurricular class or do another activity , doing an activity such as a sport requires the student to be good at the sport, and anti social students would not enjoy being pressured into doing an activity that requires communication skills.

Having the choice of doing an extracurricular activity should remain optional. Most students might enjoy not doing an extracurricular activity after school because they might have some other activity or hobby such as playing a video game, or cooking for their family. The students might even enjoy doing an activity out in nature such as fishing or hunting.

Most of the extracurricular activities involve sports, and while some students are good at sports as Babe Ruth is good at baseball, some other students are not good at sports. The reason of why some students are not good at sports could be that they think they are not physically fit, they might not understand how the sport works, or the student simply does not enjoy having to move or run a lot. Above all else sports equipment might cost more money than most people are comfortable spending.

Some students do not like socializing with other people, and most activities that schools offer require communication skills so that the group in the activity can make plans for whatever they will do. The students that do not like to socialize are often known as anti social kids. The anti social kids could feel pressured into having to do an activity that involves having to socialize with other people. Apart from that being pressure into doing something could cause have negative thoughts on the brain which could effect academic skills.

In conclusion it should not be mandatory for students to have to do an extracurricular activity because, students should be able to enjoy doing other activities outside of school, doing an activity such as a sport could require skill and before hand knowledge on sports, and most students that are anti social should not feel being pressured into having to do an activity which requires socialization.Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
7BC6842C3297,"Many students participate in extracurricular activities. Many students that participate in extracurricular activities enjoy them. Recently, our principle decided that every student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Personally, I agree with this decision because extracurricular activities are a good way to develop a skill or talent, make new friends, and it gives kids something to do.

The first reason that I agree with the principal's decision is that extracurricular activities are a good way to develop a skill or talent that you have. The talents that you learn during an extracurricular activity can help you later on in life. For example, if you work on making the yearbook, the skills that you acquired can help you make your own book in the future. One time my friend Generic_NameÂ joined the debate team; The skills he got from the debate team helped him win class president later on.

The second reason I agree with the principal's decision is because joining extracurricular activities are a good way to make friends. It's good because you already have a common interest whether it be sports, music, etc. Me and my friend Generic_Name were once complete strangers. But after we had band together we were best friends.

The final reason that I agree with the principal's decision is that extracurricular activities give students something to do. Extracurricular activities give kids a productive way to spend time instead of just watching T.V. Also extracurricular activities can keep kids from doing things that are illegal. My friend would cause trouble in the the street and get arrested, but after he got into an extracurricular activity he was a star student.

Students across the nation participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are a good thing for many students. Our principal said that every student must do at least one extracurricular activity, and I agree with this decision.

4ABA61F516D1,"The Electoral College is broken, and with another election on the way, here is why the voting should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. Voters cannot control whom their electors are, in the chance that those electors are replaced with new electors so the votes may be rigged, as well as ""faithless"" electors may refuse to vote for their party's candidate and could cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

Voters don't actually vote for the president, instead, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. In the case that you vote John Kerry in Texas, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. In the case those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral vote. Who are the electors? They could be anyone, even if their not holding office. Who even picks these electors in the first place? Sometimes it state conventions, other times it's the state's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can we, citziens of the United States, control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that shouldn't be.

In the 1960 election, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy and make it seem that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy. What would happen if their was a tie in the electoral vote? The case would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Becasue each state counts for only one vote, a single representative from Wyoming would represent 500,000 voters, 55 representatives from California who getto represent 55 representatives would have as much say as the one from Wyoming. This cannot represent the will of the people.

Now when have you changed your mind about something? Electors can do the same. Electors can refuse to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whomever they please. That can't be right, yet it has happened plently of times before. It's even unfair to the people, who sometimes don't even get to see their electors. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, they don't focus of states they know they cannot win, aiming towards ""swing states."" In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see their candidates at all, as well as 25 of the largest media markets who didn't get to see not one campaign ad.

The Electoral College dosen't hear the voice of the people, hardly plays by the rules, is something that should be erased. Even people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dale, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO agree, give the voice back to the people and abolish the Electoral College!

AC84A8657812,"Can a activity outside school be helpful for students? An outside school activity for students may sound boring or too much work for them or requires too much of their time and energy, but they don't know that doing an outside school activity can benefit them in many ways. Such as, it helps them release stress, refresh their mind, be more active, productive, have a better social life and can lead them out of their comfort zone. Students can create a new way to live their life. They can discover new things about themselves that they didn't know, and because of a sport, club or activity that they joined it can be a life changer for them.

If more students did activities outside school, that helps them be more social, talk more with other people and meet new people, have new friends and just haveÂ a better social life than they did before. If they do a sport like soccer, basketball, volleyball or any type sport, they will have to talk. They will have to talk with their team mates, tell them what he/she is thinking about to make the game even better and have new strategies for the game. Just like this also in any other activity. This little things about having to talk to people they don't really know will take them out of their comfort zone. At the beginning they might not like it because it's something they probably have never done before, and it probably be weird at the beginning but that's a good sign that they feel weird, because it means that little by little they are getting out of what they are used to do, and that makes them learn a whole new world that they didn't know about.

Doing any activity outside school also work makes people more productive and active. It converts the that way by making them get up and move, to go somewhere for them to finish and accomplish that activity. Having a goal in their mind about to go and win that game, or finish sewing where they left of yesterday or last week, finish that one book they were brainstorming about what to write about for like a week and finish investigating what they say that day while he/she was in that cave. Things like that it what makes people be more active and productive. That way people be more active because they always have in their mind theirÂ goal to finish it, and it gives them a feeling of excitement and suspense about what will happen in the future or about what they are about to discoverÂ and will learn. Because they always have that goal in their mind, that one thing they want to finish and accomplish, it makes them be a better person. For teenagers is even better for them to feel that way. If they do they will not want to stay home all day doing nothing just eat, sleep and repeat, they will not want to, because they will want to know more. If they get out of the home and do more activities outsideÂ the house, it makes them become more healthy, stronger mentally and physicallyÂ and it makes he or she have a whole new point of view on how to see life, by just staying home and go out and do new things. He or she will also influence it's family and friends, just by doing that activity. And how he or she influence other people even without wanting to. Well, people will see the you or them have changed so they will want to try it or copy you, because they will also want to change for good.

Like alwaysÂ everyone has a lot of stress as some point in their lives, and that can be harmful for humans. Also for mental and physical health because what you have in your mind your body will reflect it. Stress is one of the most commonÂ problems people have in their lives, it's something that does not go away easily and if you don't know how to control it, you can harm yourself, other people around you and people you love. That's why doing outside school/work actives may help you and other people a lot to deal with their stress. Because it mostly refreshes you mind about any thought you have, worry or feeling that has been going around in your head for a couple of days. It refreshes your mind a lot, because the activity that you are doing will distract you from any personal or just problems that you have, because you will mostly need to concentrate on the activity you are doing. If you don't have or do anything that can help you with that and don't know how to control it, you can lead yourself to make bad things, and that can get you to have even more stress and problems. Outside activities are helpful for your life over all, try it one day, maybe you will find it fun.Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
48F007CA9176,"The future is coming, whether one likes it or not. An extreme way the future is coming at us full speed ahead is driverless cars. Some people think it would be revolutionary in the best of ways, and open the doors to many other oppurtunities. Others disagree and say it is impractical and dangerous to the lives of everyday pedestrians.

Driverless cars have been tested many times. If a company is able to successfully manufacture such a car, there is always one setback: it is too expensive to be practical. This is the case with engineers at Berkeley. They created a car using magnets of opposing polarity; however, these cars recquired the update of already existing roads, which is entirely too expensive and would take years. Driverless cars are simply too expensive to be a common machine in everyday life.

The thought of driverless cars has obviously been seriously considered many times; however, it all comes down to the final outcome. If, hypothetically, the cars were successfully manufactured and the roads were somehow adjusted to fit the needs of such cars and were financially within the budget, the idea of driverless cars is still extremely dangerous. The safety of surrounding drivers and pedestrians is put at risk. No car can be completely diverless. This is because if there is a blind pedestrian walking across the street or construction going on, the car will still need driving assistance. Without it, a completely driverless car could vry well cause even more accidents than there are already. If the lives of innocent civilians are at stake, is a car that drives itself really worth it?

Continuously, if perhaps an automatic car were to hit someone and severely injur or potentially kill someone, the blame could be put onto the owner of the car. No matter how hard the owner tries to tell the court of his driverless car's accident, the person is still to blame. This could have never happened if the driver was actually driving the vehicle. This could cause many problems in the future.

All in all, the use of driverless cars should never be allowed in everyday life. Not only is it subtantially too expensive to be practical, but also dangerous and could lead to unfair and unnecassary lawsuits. The factors and outcomes are not worth the ability to not have to drive.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
C6EE9996089C,"Working in a group has become a common practice in many workplaces and educational institutions. The benefits of group work are numerous, including increased productivity, better thinking, and financial outcomes for both employers and employees. However, there are also downsides to working in a group that need to be considered and addressed.

One of the biggest benefits of group work is the increase in productivity. When individuals work together, they can combine their skills and strengths to achieve a common goal. This can lead to faster completion of tasks and more efficient use of resources. Additionally, group work allows for the division of labor, which can help to maximize productivity by allowing each member to focus on their area of expertise.

Another benefit of group work is the ability to think better. When individuals work together, they can bounce ideas off of each other and come up with creative solutions to problems. This can lead to more innovative and effective solutions than would be possible if each person worked alone. Additionally, group work allows for the exchange of different perspectives and ideas, which can lead to a more well-rounded and informed decision-making process.

Finally, group work can have positive financial outcomes for both employers and employees. For employers, group work can lead to increased productivity and efficiency, which can result in cost savings and increased profits. For employees, group work can lead to better job opportunities and higher salaries, as employers are more likely to value employees who are skilled and productive.

Despite these benefits, there are also downsides to working in a group. One of the biggest challenges is the potential for conflict and disagreement. When individuals have different opinions and ideas, it can be difficult to reach a consensus and come to a solution that is acceptable to everyone. Additionally, group work can be time-consuming, as members need to coordinate their schedules and communicate effectively in order to achieve their goals.

To overcome these challenges, it is important for groups to establish clear communication channels and guidelines for decision-making. This can help to minimize conflict and ensure that everyone is on the same page. Additionally, group members should be encouraged to actively listen to each other and consider different perspectives in order to come to the best possible solution.

In conclusion, working in a group has numerous benefits, including increased productivity, better thinking, and financial outcomes for both employers and employees. However, there are also downsides to working in a",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,6
4C70917BE924,"Drivelss cars should not be developed because they can cause accidents, they can cause the driver not to pay attetnion, and they would cost more.

Drivelss cars aren't really driveless. At certain points they will need the drivers assistance. This can lead to many accidents. In paragraph 9, the text states ""most driving laws focus on keeping dirvers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" The sentence proves that driveless cars may not be completely safe. The driver could depend on the car to drive itself and not be paying attention which can result in accidents. In paragraph 9, it also states that it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. Something would not be illegal if it's comepletely safe.

Another reason driveless cars should not be developed is becasue they can cause the drive not to pay attention. Driveless cars would be like phones. They made driving and texting illegal because it made the drivers not pay attention and caused many death and accidents. The same result can come form drivelss cars. They can be a great distraction becasue the driver would think that the car can drive itlsef and they would not pay attention. From that conclusion, in paragraph 9, the question ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer"" would come up. Who would be responsible? If the driver belived the car can drive itself and the techonology failed, it can lead to death because the driver might not be paying attention. The driver would think the car doesn't need a driver and when the techonology fails and the car spins out of control, many lives could be lost.

Driveless cars would also cost more money in many things. The cost to buy would most likely be more expensive. If drivelessc cars started being in use, there would need to be new signs that fit those specific cars. Driveless cars would aslo need specific shops and equipment. If something goes wrong you would need to get it fixed and the technology used makes it more expensive. Fixing a car is already expensive. You have to buy whatever it is you need to fix and then take it to a shop. If something in the techonology of a driveless car goes wrong and you need to get it fixed, it will denifitely cost more.

Causing accidents, causing the driver not to pay attention, and costing more are reasons why driveless cars should not be developed.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
6D41FAC8F3CF,"As an eighth-grade student, I have noticed that the world is constantly trying to make me someone else. Whether it's through social media, advertising, or even my peers, I feel pressure to conform to certain standards and expectations. However, it is important to be myself and not let the opinions of others dictate who I am.

One example of this is the constant barrage of advertising that we are exposed to on a daily basis. Companies try to convince us that we need their products in order to be happy, successful, or even attractive. However, this is not true. We should not let ourselves be swayed by these false promises, and instead should embrace our true selves.

Another example is the pressure to conform to societal expectations. For example, girls are often expected to be pretty, while boys are expected to be strong and athletic. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem if we do not fit these expectations. However, it is important to remember that our worth is not determined by our appearance or abilities, but by who we are as individuals.

It is also important to assert our emotions and convictions. We should not be afraid to express our feelings and beliefs, even if they are different from those of others. By doing so, we can stand up for what we believe in and inspire others to do the same.

One solution to this issue is to educate ourselves and others about the importance of being true to ourselves. We can teach our peers about the dangers of conformity and the benefits of embracing our individuality. We can also learn more about ourselves and our own values, so that we can better understand what makes us unique.

In conclusion, it is important to be ourselves in a world that is constantly trying to make us something else. We should not let the opinions of others dictate who we are, but instead embrace our true selves. By asserting our emotions and convictions, we can stand up for what we believe in and inspire others to do the same.

9b772f7aa7ad_04112023,"The Natural Formation of the Face on Mars

Many people see unusual patterns in everyday objects and landforms. When images of the Face on Mars were first captured, it understandably sparked interest about the possibility of an ancient civilization once living there. However, upon closer examination, the evidence strongly suggests the Face is simply a natural rock formation sculpted over time by wind and other erosive forces. 

There are a few key pieces of evidence that support the Face being a natural landform rather than an artificial structure. First, high resolution images reveal no definitive artificial structures anywhere near the Face that would indicate an intelligent source. If it were part of a complex, one would expect to see buildings, roads or other signs of habitation. Additionally, the Face lacks symmetry, which is uncommon for constructed faces or monuments. Its features are uneven and distorted, more characteristic of random geological patterns. 

Second, scientists have identified the specific geological processes that could have shaped the Face's appearance. The rock layers in that region are composed of harder and softer stones. When winds erode the softer layers more quickly than the harder stone ""eyebrows"" above, it creates shadows that resemble eyes. Over millions of years of steady erosion, such natural weathering could plausibly produce a passing resemblance to a human face. No artificial mechanisms would be needed to explain its formation. 

Lastly, multiple unmanned missions have provided ample opportunity to capture the Face from different angles and lighting conditions. Yet none have revealed any other site characteristics typical of an inhabited settlement. If it were an ancient statue or memorial, we would expect to find other constructed elements nearby over time. The preponderance of evidence thus indicates the Face on Mars is simply a chance product of natural geological forces, not an artifact of ancient Martian civilization. While speculation about its origins is part of human nature, the most scientifically sound conclusion is that it is a natural rock formation, not proof of past life on the red planet.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,0

08F8BF983C64,"Teacher assigned projects will keep everyone happy,Even though student designed projects are more creative and are the students choice they don't always know or understand what the teacher wants from their project,but when its a teacher designed project the students will have a better idea of what the teacher is looking for and can try to meet allÂ those goals. It also makes the project more structured when the teacher makes it and everyone is expected to have the same type of project. It also makes grading easier for teachers cause they know what to expect.

When a teacher assigns a project they usually list certain requirements that they want in a project. Another project a teacher may assign is a packet with questions they ask the students to complete for the first day of school. With these types of assignments it is easy to know what the teacher is asking you to present for them. inÂ a student designed project they cannot make the requirements very specific cause students may be doing completely opposite topics which make the teachers requirements very vague.

Teacher designed projects are easier on teachers. Grading is easier for teachers when they create it,because they know what they want and in their projects they design they can just look through the students work and check to see if they mention what was wanted in the rubric. Also if its teacher designed then they will most likely be old projects they have done in the past which they would know how to answer any problems that my arise for students while trying to create their work.

Yes even though teacher designed projects are not as creativity promoting as a student project it still does allow students to be creative in how they answer or present cause not every project will be the same while also having key details. Another point student designed project people may choose is that it makes it so that it is easier since its new and the student chose to do this topic the problem with that is the student may have been able to chose the topic but it may not have been a good topic that would've been presented well also if its new every year then the teachers may encounter problems that were not resolved due to the projects being different every year.

However, the ability to work productively with a group of individuals can result in more meaningful outcomes than attempting to go solo. By pooling together different experiences, knowledge and skills, a team has the potential to capitalize on strengths that a single person may not possess. 

Working collectively enables us to learn from each other, identify new ideas and gain different perspectives. It creates the potential to engage and collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds, who can bring valuable experience and reasoned insights. Having a variety of perspectives can provide a well-rounded outlook and can help to motivate and inform one another.

Group work can increase the efficiency of a project. Working together allows for the division of labor, which can help reduce the workload and produce better quality results in a shorter period of time. Additionally, dividing tasks amongst members can help to reduce the stress associated with the project.

A08514994C66,"Many students are tired of having to wake up early every morning to attend school. Due to this, some schools offer a distance learning program that people believe will benefit the student by allowing them to work from home. Distance learning is not beneficial because the student will lose valuable life traits, and the student will suffer.

While many people believe that distance learning will still allow students to gain important life skills; in fact, the students lose valuable traits needed in society due to not going to school. The students lose social skills by being at home all the time. The inability to communicate effectively with other humans is lost by not attending school. The students who do not come to school will have a hard time obtaining a job that involves speaking to another person because they did not learn how to when they should have. Additionally, the student also loses the ability to be independent when they are learning from home. Educational institutes teach students how to be independent in the future, and students who do not physically attend school will, after they graduate, constantly beg for everything to be handed to them. Students who never learned how to be properly independent will also never want to work for anything, thus furthering their need to rely on others. Furthermore, students who learn from home will undoubtedly lose the ability to make lasting friendships. Not being able to meet and interact with people at a young age significantly lowers an individual's circle of friends. Not having friends also makes a person feel lonely, having nobody to talk to or laugh with. Distance learning greatly reduces the skills an individual will possess, not allowing him to become a fully functioning member of society.

People say that distance learning will make the student want to do work; however, the student will only suffer due to not attending school. The student's grades will suffer by not arriving at campus every day. Being comfortable will make the student do less work, therefore lowering his grade. Students will likely sleep through courses rather than complete them because they are at home instead of school, which will lower their grades. Moreover, students will also suffer mentally while not attending school. Being the only person who attends school online will result in the student getting cyberbullied by his classmates outside of school, therefore taking a toll on his mental health. Not being able to ask for help effectively if one needs it can stress a student out, hurting their brain. Also, the student physically suffers by not attending school. By not physically walking from class to class each day, the student's legs will grow weak and may eventually give out if not worked on. Students participating in distance learning courses are incapable of taking physical education, which is a very important course, strengthening an individual's body and mind. Indeed, distance learning makes the student suffer in more ways than one.

While distance learning may be needed for certain people, such as ones with illness or disabilities; nevertheless, for the majority of students, it is not very beneficial. Students who attend distance learning courses suffer more than students who physically attend school. They suffer both mentally and physically, and their grades spiral downhill. Distance learning courses also prevent students from obtaining life skills needed in their future. Skills such as communication and independence are lost when the student does not arrive to their educational building each and every day. If distance learning becomes more popular, students all over the world will live in a future where they cannot function properly, and the generations to come will not have much of a society to live in.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
E9E6AC0ABFB1,"Although teachers do have the ability to design projects over the summer to prevent a lost of knowledge over the long break however, students should be able to make there own decision on designing there own summer projects. A student-designed summer project can be beneficial in various ways such as allowing students to express there creativity, take matters into there own hands, and to be able to gain new learning experiences. Teachers should encourage this recommendation upon students so they are able to generate there own thoughts and ideas. Therefore, students would not have the mentality of doing work the teachers way, but to acknowledge there own differences amongÂ other students. The idea of summer projects is beneficial overall, but giving students the ability to design them will open a new door for learning.

As a student are given a summer project over a long course of time they should be able to design it since it is there own project. There own designs will allow them to generate unique ideas with the spread creativity which enhances there learning abilities. Bill Gates, a famous billionaire known for his worldwide inventions, with his past of dropping out of college and doing what he loved as a full time job allowed him to express his unique ideas while also becoming successful. This may not correlate with student-designed summer projects however, when individuals let there own ideas run free it allows them to experience new thoughts that can be put into use for better accomplishments. Student-designed projects will increase knowledge of students by letting there creativity and ideas run freely.

Students taking matters into their own hand is one step closer to adulthood so why not give students the ability to design a summer project. Giving students authority may be risky, but can be beneficial, so when becoming an adult they will have experience of independence and leadership skills. Marther Luther King Jr, a civil rights activistÂ famous for his ""I have a dream"" speech, took matters into his own hands by protesting for equal rights. However, it led him into trouble with the law, but this activist is well known for his speech which he expressed his own ideas with the ongoingÂ events that made the country realize how it is effecting others. Therefore, students that have authority on certain situations will allow better communication to express there own ideas and thoughts.

It is true when teachers say that some students learn effectively when other students teach them therefore, students that are allowed to express there ideas and share them with other will gain a sense of new understanding of knowledge. Student-designed projects will give them the sense of looking into new findings and understand them. An example would be if a student is stuck during a situation but another student expresses there thoughts, the student that had trouble can learn through others and then come to there own understanding. Acknowledging that others ideas can influence everyone as a whole can provide a well understanding of situations. The benefit of individuals letting there creativity spread allows other to gain new learning experience that have never been thought of before.

In the future, teachers should let more students take an advantage on projects to express there own thoughts with other and spread creativity all around. This act will teach students new learning experiences with also taking matters into there own hands. Everyone learns better when one expresses there thoughts, so why not let student be able to incorporate that into projects.Â  Â  Â    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
4014F3766E03,"Some schools give out the option of attending classes from home. Instead of going to school, students learn their subjects online or through video conferencing. EvenÂ thoughÂ this method of learning is not as popular, it is more effective for students. I know students would benefit from being able to take online classes at home.

First, being at home is better than being in a stuffy learning facility. Multiple studies have proven that students learn better when given time outside away from the iridescent lights and circulated air. When students are crammed in a building with different people for hours, it tends to get harder to focus from distractions, some people get tense, and others might get antsy from boredom or anxiety. When at home, you do not have to be with multiple people in a boxy building, sitting, for hours; you can go outside and breathe fresh air if you want. You can choose where you want to do your work as long as there is internet access around, like in your bedroom. Being at home is all around more comfortable and when people are comfortable, they tend to excel better at what they are doing.

Second, in a school there are hundreds, and in some cases maybe even thousands, of people you may not know; there are regulations that some may find annoying and restricting, but when at home, you are most likely in a space that you know and feel comfortable in. You are around familiar faces that do not intimidate you, so the chances of peer pressure are slim. You do not have to be afraid of wearing headphones or failing because of the stress teachers give when expecting students to finish stacks of work in one class sitting. Instead, you can wear whatever you want and classes are most likely on a schedule that work for you. Since you are at ease, it is easier to focus on what needs to get done and succeed at the curriculum.

Some may say, that people who attend classes from home, will slack off and not learn anything. This is because there are not as many authoritative figures around to execute and remind these students of what is to be done. However, the students who do their schooling online are in a better and comfortable learning environment.Â Therefore, making it easier to learn and complete the necessary assignments vital to their subjects.

In conclusion, attending classes online is given by some schools and includes online work or video conferences. The online schooling is more supplemental toward students and their learning because they do not have to deal with detrimental factors that can slow down learning such as: peer pressure, strangers, unknown or uncomfortable learning environments, stressful teachers, or strict rules. Online schooling is an all around better learning environment and will benefit students. All schools should give out the option of attending classes online.   Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
6BFDA0FE1CB2,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""to be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" I strongly agree. Have you ever felt like you have to be someone else you are not? This is something that most people who living in this world are dealing with. Us human being live in a world nowadays that is actually don't want us to be ourselves, no matter how hard we try, we most likely end up not being confident, and having low self esteem. we think that we have to be someone else to please our society, which is not very true. Therefore fighting with this world to be ourselves is one the greatest accomplishment because, people become more confident, they get the chance to be their real selves, and they don't try to please others.

Firstly, people become more confident. No matter how good a person can look, having no confidence fade the beauty away. No confidence make people look weak and they don't believe much in themselves. As an example, some people may have terrible stuttering problems, and sometimes it may make them feel like not wanting communicate with others, or some people would love to have a conversation, but they might think that they are going to get laughed at because it's hard to get their words out. However fighting this obstacle can improve their lives and build them up to have more confident. This is one reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Secondly, people get a chance to be their real selves. Some people get lost trying to be someone else that they are not because the society want to change them.

For example, in some countries, especially my country, Haiti, people get bullied for being in the LGBT community. Some parent, family members, or friends might not accept them for who they really are, so they have to hide it and try to be normal like every body else. Sometimes some of them feel like they are getting rejected by the community and they just to want to be alone crying or even want to commit suicide. This is a major reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Lastly, people don't try to please others. Some people would do absolutely anything to please their significant others or their friends. As they pleasing them, they end up making that person happy and automatically forget about their own happiness, which is not right. For example, some people might have abusive boyfriends/girlfriends who want them to do everything their way. Deep down inside they don't really want to, but they probably love that person and they have to do it if they want to please them. They end up falling in an awful situation that may even risk their lives. This is a last reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

As a summary, be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. you become more confident. you get the chance to be the real you. You do not try to please others. If people keeps being themselves in this world that just want them to be someone else, then they would find themselves where they've lost it and they would also find happiness.",0,original_moth,"Task:

ECCCE5302B19,"Phones and Driving

Although Cell Phones are pretty useful it does not mean that people should be glued on to it the whole time. They may help connect one another, but at some points, the phone has to be put down. Such as when someone is doing tasks that need them to be focused. For example, driving needs the person driving to be all the way focused. Although most people may tend to use their phones for a GPS system most cars in this modern day have a GPS system within it. Phones should not be used in driving because of less attention on the road, setting a bad example for young children, and it is worse than driving under the influence.

First of all, cell phones are a Manual distraction. This means that the tasks that require the driver to take a hand off the steering wheel and manipulate a device. (Hilbert 24) Due to this, the driver is more distracted and unsafe when driving. According to the text ""This inventory highlighted aspects of equipment designs that could affect driver distraction.""(Hilbert 30) This means that the driver would spend more time looking at a screen than on the road. As stated by the author, ""Cellular phones, and other in-vehicle distractions, force drivers to divide their limited attentional resources among tasks, thereby focusing less of their attention on driving."" (Delashmit 160)

Phones may still be useful for people but less time looking at the road is still not a good thing and could set a bad example for younger children.

Secondly, children have a developing mind. Meaning that certain events may scar them for life. They may even think that it is okay to be on the phone. As it states in the text "" For example, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, in collaboration with NHTSA, found that driver inattention was involved in 80 percent of all vehicle crashes (65 percent of near-crashes)."" (Delashmit 150) If a parent or older sibling, while a child is in a car, is on the phone when driving then they are more likely to be distracted from the road and crash. The younger people are trusting the person who is driving and if there were to be an accident then it could start the development to a mental health disorder. As stated by the author ""These implications highlight the degree to which a child or adolescent is likely to be involved, witness or experience a crash or the consequences of a crash and therefore be subjected to any number of physical injuries or psychological disorders.""(Greydanus 92) If it was not bad enough driving under the influence is a little like worse then spending eighty percent of the time on the phone while driving.

Finally, although driving under the influence is bad, it is still not worse then spending more time looking on the phone then on the road. As stated in the text ""The public does not appear to be as cognizant of this social responsibility aspect, as distinct from personal risk, for in-vehicle technology use, compared to alcohol.""(Hilbert 153) This meaning that driving under the influence is not as bad as being on the phone.

A test was conducted to see how drivers would drive under the influence or on the phone. The results where ""Some studies of cell phone use have compared the degradation of performance to some level of alcohol impairment. Strayer, Drews, & Crouch (2006), for example, found in a study of simulated driving that drivers using cell phones had elevated crash risks similar to those of drivers with blood alcohol concentrations of approximately .08 g/dL, though the specific impairments of each group differed."" This test showed that there were more accidents with being on the phone than driving under the influence.

Although some may say that having the phone out is okay seeing as it is used for navigation. There are laws in place for driving and having a cellular device. As stated by the text ""These laws take several forms: Some require drivers to use a hands-free device if they want to talk on the phone, some prohibit younger or less experienced drivers from using any type of cell phone, and some allow officers to cite drivers for using a handheld cell phone if the driver is pulled over for another offense.""(Guerin 163) As shown they only get in trouble or is only bad if they have it in their hand only if they get pulled over and the officer sees it in their hand. Driving while on the phone is not bad.

In conclusion, phones and driving is not that good. It puts the risk of lives on the line. It causes more vehicle accidents on the road than any other distraction. Although it maybe be handy to help navigate it still should not be used eighty percent of the time while on the road. It sets a bad example for children. It is still slightly worse then driving under the influence. Driving and having a phone out is bad.

EB274FBC904F,"I think some schools offering learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing is a good thing.

First of all,not all schools has the programs you want to do. Lets say you want to be an I.T, but your school doesn't provide that program in your school. So you look for a different school to go to that has what you are looking for,or an online class to help you when you are not going school maybe you take online classes. Staying home and doing online classes helps too cause you might not have the classes you wanted on your scheduleÂ for that school year. This helps students focus on what they want to be in the future.

Secondly, by going to a different school helps with what you want for your future career. You will have teachers that knows more about your future career. You can ask questions about what you need for the career you want to major in ,in the future. Some people can be at home searching upÂ about what they need on the computer while taking an online class. Some people will watch videos of what they are going to be in the future, like me, I learn better when see something or a demonstration of the job I am going to be doing.

Basically, I think student wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, if you are at home you are only going to ask the computer , you are just going to search it up. When you are at school you will have people that knows what is going to happen because the computer is not going to tell you everything. When you are in school, you have teachers that may have had that job before. those teachers may have more experience in it, so you will have more information on the career you are looking for in life.

Some people may auger that staying home and not going to class will benefit you because with don't have to go anywhere. You have everything at your finger tips and it's much easier. Plus you are at home you don't have to walk and ask teacher about what they think about your future career, you can just search it up. And I disagree with that because the computer doesn't tell you the details of you career.

In conclusion student going to classes and having to see or experience whats it going to happen in the future is better than staying home and taking online classes.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
AF98232BDB08,"As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that students should not be allowed to use cell phones for educational purposes in the classroom. While some may argue that cell phones can be used as a tool for learning, I believe that the potential distractions and negative impacts on academic performance outweigh any potential benefits.

Firstly, cell phones are a major distraction in the classroom. Studies have shown that even the mere presence of a cell phone can decrease cognitive performance and memory retention. In a study conducted by the University of California, Irvine, students who were allowed to use cell phones in class performed 20% worse on tests than those who were not allowed to use them. This is because cell phones are designed to be constantly stimulating, with notifications, social media, and games all vying for attention. When students are allowed to use cell phones in class, it is almost impossible for them to focus solely on the lesson at hand.

Secondly, cell phones can be a major source of cheating in the classroom. With the internet at their fingertips, students can easily access answers and cheat on tests and assignments. In fact, a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 35% of teenagers have cheated on a test or assignment at least once. This is a serious problem, as cheating not only undermines the integrity of the educational system, but also teaches students that it is acceptable to cut corners and take the easy way out.

Finally, cell phones can be a major source of distraction outside of the classroom as well. Students who are constantly glued to their phones are missing out on important social interactions and experiences. They are also not developing the necessary skills to communicate effectively in person. In a world where face-to-face communication is becoming increasingly rare, it is important that students are given the opportunity to develop these skills.

In conclusion, while cell phones may have some potential benefits for education, the potential distractions and negative impacts on academic performance and social development make it clear that students should not be allowed to use them for educational purposes in the classroom. By banning cell phones in the classroom, we can create a more focused and productive learning environment, and help students develop the skills they need to succeed in the future.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,3
8F3B39C509B9,"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to consider the pros and cons of identifying one's career path in high school. While it can be beneficial to have a clear plan, it can also lead to unnecessary stress and pressure.

On one hand, identifying a career path early on can be beneficial for students. It allows them to focus their efforts on courses and extracurricular activities that align with their goals. This can lead to a more fulfilling and successful high school experience. Additionally, it can give students a sense of direction and purpose, which can be particularly helpful during a time of major life changes.

However, there are also potential downsides to identifying a career path too early. It can be difficult for students to fully understand their interests and passions at such a young age. They may miss out on opportunities to explore different fields and discover new passions. Additionally, there may be pressure to conform to certain expectations and limitations based on their chosen career path, which can lead to feelings of frustration and dissatisfaction.

It is important for students to strike a balance between having a clear plan and being open to new experiences. They should consider their interests and passions, but also be willing to explore different options and make changes if necessary. Additionally, they should not feel pressure to conform to certain expectations or limitations based on their chosen career path.

In conclusion, identifying a career path in high school can be both beneficial and challenging. It is important for students to consider their interests and passions, but also be open to new experiences. They should not feel pressure to conform to certain expectations or limitations based on their chosen career path. By finding a balance, students can have a fulfilling and successful high school experience.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,6
1d99469b4d5c_04112023,"I disagree with the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurriculars provide many benefits, forcing participation risks overwhelming some students and interfering with other priorities.

Many students already feel overcommitted with academic course loads, part-time jobs, family responsibilities, or other obligations outside of school. Requiring extracurricular involvement could negatively impact their mental health and performance by piling on additional stress and leaving little leisure or rest time. Extracurriculars are meant to be voluntarily pursued based on personal interests and ability levels. Forcing participation removes student choice and autonomy over how to spend non-academic hours. 

Not all students have the bandwidth or inclination to take on scheduled commitments beyond classes. Some learn and recharge best by spending non-school hours in quiet independent activities like reading, hobbies, meditation or time in nature. These types of personal enrichment should still be respected as valuable ways for students to broaden themselves. 

While extracurriculars provide benefits like learning time management, developing interests and social skills, those rewards may not outweigh the costs for every single student. Not every student needs the same experiences to flourish. Forcing uniform participation risks sidelining individual differences and priorities. A one-size-fits-all policy risks becoming a burden rather than a benefit for some.

Instead of requirements, the school would be better off strongly encouraging extracurricular involvement and helping students find opportunities that suit their needs and passions. Students who want to get more from their education can then voluntarily sign up, while overcommitted students can focus on maintaining well-being. This allows personal choice that considers each student's circumstances rather than a mandated standardized approach.

In conclusion, while extracurriculars offer rewarding experiences for many, requiring universal participation risks negatively impacting students' well-being, performance and development. A encouraged but not mandated approach allows for individual differences and priorities in how students choose to allocate their extra hours of personal time. For these reasons, I do not support mandating extracurricular involvement for all students.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,1
8F692893B62F,"Cell phones And Driving

Cell phones have become a part of our everyday lives. We are so focused on what's going on with the device that we are risking our daily lives. Using a handheld phone can be very dangerous and lead to multiple car accidents. It can be a life changing accident instantly. You may think you can do it for a second but it's not safe at all. The problem is people don't think it is a problem and that's why it's still going on. ""Monkey see monkey do"", is similar because if adults do it then young drivers will think they can do it too, which is one of the causes of this issue. According to reports ""before you go to bed 9 people die because of texting and driving"". This is more serious than most people think. One day you could be on the road and another car hit you because they are paying attention to the phone and not the road.

I strongly think drivers should not be able to use any device while operating any vehicle. It put so many people in a big risk of losing their lives everyday. The main reason it should be stopped is because it causes too many car accidents. Cell phones are the leading cause of half a million deaths on the road each year. It impacts our health and society. Banning cell phones will make it safer on the road and less accidents will happen. It's a serious problem that have to be dealt with. It's only so much a person can focus fully on and it should be the road.

Another reason why people should not use their cell phone while driving is because your insurance could rise up. The more accidents you get into the higher your insurance will be. Although cell phones can be a good use with helping with directions,or calling a loved one there also a negative impact that comes with it. One accidents can change someone life instantly. It can leave you or a person with physical injuries that may takes weeks,or months to heel. You can suffer from short term or permanent effects on your body or brain. You can also gain a result of depression or anxiety from the accident. It's very dangerous and people are hurting because one person choose to be on the phone instead of just trying to get home safe.

In some states phones are banned but it should be in every state and country. It can be very dangerous, not only can you hurt yourself but you can hurt others with a crazy decision that can nearly change your future forever. You could go to jail and have to pay a big fine and go to court. It could be on your record for killing someone. It's just not worth losing everything. Put it in the glove compartment just until you step outside the car.

Texting and driving is just very dangerous. Just don't do it - you are putting everyone's life in danger on the road. One look away can turn your life around instantly. Being focused and determined while driving can help everyone out. If we don't stop, these accidents will increase everyday. Your life is not the only one that matters. When you are driving you are driving for everyone. So, next time just think - is that phone call more important than your life. It just not worth it.               ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
8FA286B4FAE3,"I think the Electoral College need changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United State . Because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiaso was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. The election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in state they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "" swing"" state. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyoune has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.       Â     ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
A2EED30DD075,"In my opinionÂ , I say that us students should have the offer too have school projects. The examples im gonna provide is too say why we should have these projects over the summer because they can give us a topic about what we did over the summer as a project. for examples , this can bring so many students grades up and ill teach us about what each students did over the summer by looking at there project by including pictures and so many more details. Also , this will be a fun activity that everyone will enjoy around the world.

In addition , you wouldnt really need summer school anymore for some other students. This can provide them too move up to the next grade level by providing them with these school projects. All you gotta do is give them a topic about what they did over summer and it can most likely make them succeed , all they gotta do is provide pictures , details , and have something too do with the subjects thatÂ they learn in school such as english , math , and scienceÂ included in the project. it can bring us all together and closer as a school if we did something like this.

Furthermore , you can even provide a reward when school starts again. It can be a first , second , and a third place winner , the prize should be of any students choosing such as a ten dollar gift card too their favorite fast food restaurant. this will make students want too try even harder and wanna compete with each other of who got the best and coolest project out of everyone. also , we can all get in frontÂ of the class to show off are talent and decorationsÂ too all the teachers and staff. To continue , this would be a huge opportunity too us students that we will mighty enjoy.

78018FB48420," Students should not be allowed to graduate early. It is better to stay in school for an additional year as it provides more opportunities for learning and career exploration. The fourth year of high school allows students to take more classes and learn at their own pace. It also gives them more time to discover their interests and pursue potential career paths.

Students who complete their fourth year of high school have access to a wider range of electives and courses that can help them make informed decisions about their future. They can take advantage of opportunities such as internships, apprenticeships, and volunteer work to gain valuable experience and knowledge. This experience can be invaluable when it comes to applying for college or entering the workforce.

Additionally, students who complete their fourth year of high school may be less stressed out as they have more time to manage their workload and prioritize their responsibilities. They can also take advantage of resources such as academic counseling and tutoring to help them succeed in their classes.

It is important to remember that college is not the only pathway to success. Many students may choose to pursue a gap year or attend a vocational school to gain practical experience and skills in their chosen field. Completing their fourth year of high school provides students with the opportunity to explore these options and make informed decisions about their future.

The technology could keep peoples mind focused and maybe make them more open minded. Like if you were sad and the computer detected that then the computer might pop up a game or video hat could make you feel differently.

The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. The muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them.

The conclusion to this statement is that new technology could be a good thing doing through the decades of the universe.

llama_70b_v11108,"I think that students would greatly benefit from the option to attend classes from home through distance learning. There are several reasons why this is the case.

Firstly, distance learning provides students with the flexibility to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This can be particularly helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas where access to traditional schools is limited. By being able to attend classes from home, students can complete their coursework on their own time and in a comfortable and familiar environment.

Secondly, distance learning allows students to access a wider range of courses and educational resources than they might otherwise have access to. For example, a student living in a rural area might not have access to a particular course or subject at their local school, but through distance learning, they can access that course online. This can help to ensure that students receive a well-rounded education and have the opportunity to explore their interests and passions.

Thirdly, distance learning can be more engaging and interactive than traditional classroom learning. Online classes can include multimedia elements such as videos, animations, and virtual reality, which can help to make learning more dynamic and engaging. Additionally, online discussions and forums can provide students with the opportunity to connect with their peers and engage in meaningful discussions about the course material.

Finally, distance learning can be more cost-effective than traditional education. Without the need for physical classrooms and transportation, distance learning can provide students with a high-quality education at a lower cost. This can be particularly beneficial for students who might not have the financial resources to attend a traditional school.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that students would benefit from the option to attend classes from home through distance learning. The flexibility, access to a wider range of courses, engagement, and cost-effectiveness of distance learning make it an attractive option for students who want to receive a high-quality education.",1,llama_70b_v1,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

67780BCAD15F,"Cars are an integral part of many peoples' lives around the world: they provide transportation to work and home, they cater to social lives, and for some they even provide a home.

However, it's becoming a trend to limit car usage, particularly in Europe. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up cars almost completely, with the exception of a $40,000 parking garage fee that over half of the residents have elected not to use.

While it may make getting places harder, the effects of cutting down on car usage are mostly good ones.

First and foremost on this list is global warming. In Europe, cars produce around twelve percent of greenhouse emmissions, while in the US, the number can be as high as fifty percent in cities. This is not good. Global warming is destroying the ice caps and the ozone layer of Earth, leading to a temperature increase that is damaging many enviornments around the world. This, in addition to pollution released by cars and the oil industry, could permanantly cripple our planet. Any way that we can cut the effects of global warming should be implemented.

Secondly, crowded cities benefit in many ways from a lessening of driving. Some cities, like Paris, have already had to enact a partial ban on driving due to a heavy smog layer. Other cities, like Beijing, is even more polluted, and cities in this country suffer as well. If less people drove, the air would be clearer, as was the case in Paris.

Also, there is less crowding when less people are driving. Anyone who has driven through or lived in a large city knows just how bad congestion and traffic jams can be. Less driving would mean less congestion, making it easier for people to get to work, school, or other locations on time. When Paris enacted its driving ban of those with even-numbered liscence plates, congestion went down sixty percent.

Finally, using an alternative to cars can save money. Public transportation could be expensive and, frankly, overcrowded, but it provi        Â     ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
9BF2607D4878,"The concept of first impressions has been a topic of interest for many years. It is a widely held belief that the first impression is almost impossible to change. This statement has significant implications for people, objects, and situations. In this essay, I will reflect on the implications of this statement and offer examples to illustrate it. I will also form an opinion on the statement and offer evidence to support it or challenge it.

The first impression is a critical aspect of human interaction. It is the initial perception that a person has of another person, object, or situation. The first impression is formed within seconds of meeting someone or encountering something new. It is based on nonverbal cues such as body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions. The first impression is so powerful that it can influence how a person perceives and interacts with the object or person in the future.

For example, a job interview is a situation where the first impression is crucial. The interviewer forms an initial perception of the candidate based on their appearance, body language, and tone of voice. If the first impression is positive, the interviewer is more likely to give the candidate a chance. On the other hand, if the first impression is negative, the candidate may not get the job.

Similarly, the first impression can affect how people perceive objects. For instance, a car's first impression is based on its design, color, and brand. People tend to judge a car based on its first impression, and this can influence their decision to buy it or not.

However, some people argue that the first impression is not impossible to change. They believe that people can change their perception of an object or person based on subsequent interactions. For example, a person may have a negative first impression of someone, but if they interact with them more and get to know them better, their perception may change.

In conclusion, the statement âThe first impression is almost impossible to changeâ has significant implications for people, objects, and situations. The first impression is a critical aspect of human interaction and can influence how a person perceives and interacts with the object or person in the future. While some people argue that the first impression is not impossible to change, the evidence suggests that it is a powerful and enduring aspect of human perception. Therefore, it is essential to be mindful of the first impression and strive to make a positive",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,7

65c6fb0f,"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and can have a positive impact on both individuals and the environment. The passage set provides several examples of communities and cities that have implemented measures to reduce reliance on cars and promote alternative modes of transportation.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. By reducing the number of cars on the road, as seen in Vauban, Germany, and during car-free days in Bogota, Colombia, these communities have been able to decrease their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. This is crucial in combating climate change and improving air quality.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on mental well-being. Residents of Vauban, Germany reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. The freedom from the constant tension associated with driving is a compelling reason for many to limit their car usage. Furthermore, the shift towards more compact and accessible communities, as seen in Vauban and other planned developments, encourages walking and cycling, which can improve physical health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

Limiting car usage can also lead to increased efficiency and economic benefits. The car-free days in Bogota resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion, allowing for smoother traffic flow and shorter commute times. This can improve productivity and reduce economic losses associated with traffic congestion. Additionally, the development of alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit and bike-sharing programs, can create employment opportunities and stimulate economic growth.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote a sense of community and social interaction. By creating pedestrian-friendly streets and placing stores within walking distance, as seen in Vauban and other planned developments, people are more likely to engage in face-to-face interactions and form social connections. This can improve community cohesion and create a more vibrant and livable urban environment.

It is important to note that the advantage of limiting car usage does not mean completely eliminating cars. Car ownership is still allowed in Vauban, Germany, but with limited parking spaces at the edge of the development. This allows for those who require a car to have access to one, while encouraging alternative modes of transportation for everyday activities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvements in mental and physical well-being, increased efficiency and economic benefits, and the promotion of community and social interaction. As demonstrated in the passages, communities and cities around the world are adopting measures to limit car usage and promote alternative modes of transportation. These efforts are crucial in creating sustainable and livable communities for the future.",1,radek_500,,1

3671DB5110C0,"Dear Principal,

I think students who have less than a B average should be able to do sports, because doing sports teaches us students responsibility, and self discipline. It might not seem like it to you, but coming from a student who enjoys sports, I know how it makes most students act, and feel.

I think you should at least give the students a chance to show you that they would be able to get their grade up so they could play on teams and show their pride for their school. I know I enjoy getting out there, and just playing what I want to play. It motivates me to do my homework, study for tests, focus more in class. That seems to be one of the problems why you don't want students doing sports, because you want them to focus more on their work, well, I'm not sure that would be the best idea.

A lot of students find it irritating that they can't play because of their work, or grades, or something like that. And It makes them not want to do any other work. I'm sorry if this sounds rude, but I am just trying to let you know how the other students would probably feel about this. I just don't think it's fair that some students wouldn't be able to play because of a grade. Maybe if they had a failing grade then I would say no they shouldn't be able to play. But it's not a failing grade and you should give them the chance to show themselves that they can focus on their work, and still play the sport they love to play.

Yes, some students might not be as devoted as other students to get their work done, but definitely most students would think that if they can't play a sport then they better get their work done. It's just depends on the kid, but I know most of us teenagers would definitely try for that spot on the team if we just got the chance!

In the Sources 1,2,3 , and 4 all imphasizes on how having a limit of car usage can be an great advantage to society. I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.

With that being said , Limiting car use lowers air pollution. I agree with this because the less cars driven leads to less burning fuel. According to the passage by Robert Duffer paragraph 10 states that ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""Due to the high population in Paris and numerous amount of the owning a vehicle causes massive car pollution. Having massive car pollution can be dangerous, this inherits sickness, stress and diseases. Refering to the source ""Car-free Day is spinning into a big hit in Bogata,Columbia"" Mayor Of Bogota (Antanas Mockus) stated that ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" As he rode a two seater bike with his wife. The Mayor in this content speaks the absolute truth. As you walk to your destination in the nice warm air you relive stress and diseases that were causing you to be sick before. Those are the reasons why i think limiting car usage lowers the pollution.

Additionally, Limitiing car usage decreases traffic. This is true because if there is 5 people going to the same place you are and all of you guys drive in that one car or bus that reduces the traffic. Micheal Sivak In Source 4 ( The end of car Culture) elaborates on that by saying ""What most intrgues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before downturn, I Think that means something more fundamental is going on.""What Mr. Sivak means by this is that everyone should only have a certain amount of car per household and person Which will also lower the traffic. Traffic in paris is very long but due to the car-free act traffic was reduces. from reading source 2 by Robert Duffer ,it states ""Congestion was down 60 % in the capital of france (Paris), after five days of intensifying smong."" Just in five days of no driving the air is already unpolluted imageded if you drived five days all day. Those are the reasons why i think that Limiting car usage is an advantage.

To Conclude,I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

Whether you're looking to spend time with friends and family, get some exercise, or complete school assignments, community parks offer a peaceful and natural setting for all of these activities.

One of the main benefits of community parks is the opportunity to bond with loved ones. With plenty of open space and activities to do, you can spend quality time together while getting some fresh air and exercise. For example, you could go for a walk or jog together, play a game of catch, or simply sit on a bench and enjoy each other's company.

Community parks are also a great place to get some exercise. With a variety of sports facilities and equipment available, you can burn some calories and have fun at the same time. You might even make some new friends while you're at it. For instance, you could bring your own ball to the court and invite others to join in a game of basketball or volleyball.

In addition to providing opportunities for exercise and socializing, community parks are also a great place to study and complete school assignments. The peaceful and natural setting can help you focus and relax, making it easier to get work done.

While I may have other talents, such as being skilled in sports like basketball, softball, track, and soccer, I don't consider them to be true talents. I have learned these skills as a result of my dad's desire to keep my siblings and me busy and away from our phones.

Soccer is the first sport I learned, and I found it to be quite enjoyable. The thrill of performing tricks and running around the field made it an exciting experience. However, soccer is not as well-known as it should be, and it is not as popular as other sports like basketball or football. In the Middle East, soccer is very popular, but it is not as widely recognized as it should be. In England, it is called football, which I understand is a fitting name for the sport.

Track is another sport I enjoy, and I find it to be quite relaxing. Running in the track is not about winning, but rather about the feeling of freedom and the wind rushing through your hair. The long jump is my favorite because it feels like I am flying when I jump, and then I touch the ground and it is gone. Running is not about beating other people, but rather about the experience of being outdoors and enjoying the fresh air.

Basketball is another sport I enjoy, and I find it to be quite challenging. It is a mystery whether or not you will make the shot, and it requires a lot of practice and dedication to improve. Watching basketball players on TV has helped me to become a better player, just like them. However, I find it unfair that boys and girls are separated in basketball, with the girls' league being less popular than the boys'. In my school, the girls' league is not as well-known as the boys', and I wish it were more popular.

Softball is a sport I enjoy, and I find it to be quite different from other sports. It is a fun way to pass the time during the off-season, and it is a great way to stay active.

BF4BD008BA9E,"Schools make summer projects for students to continue their learning, but they can't decide whetherÂ they want it to be student-designed or teacher-designed. Student-designed projects would be more beneficial because students would be able to research their interest. Students would be able to use this summer project as a opportunity to find their passions and do some research about them. People might prefer a teacher-designed project, but I believe that student-designed projects would be much more efficient and helpful to students.

A student-designed project is a great idea because it would benefit the students more than teacher-designed one. This project would have students choose their own topic and do some research on said topic. Students would be given the opportunity to explore their interest, unlike with most projects. Students could use a internship or a presentation about their research to show their progress. Students who do an internship would have to present about their experience and prove that they actually did it. At the end of summer, students would present to one of their classes how they documented their experiences and what they learned from this project.

One of the biggest reasons why I think that a student-designed project would be a great idea is that it lets students find their interest. Teens in high school try to find what they are good by participating in extracurricularÂ activities after school. A student-designed project would be the perfect opportunity to find interests. Students would be given some time before school ends to think about the topic they want to research. Summer would be used to research their topic and document their experience. This project could help students get an idea of what they want to study in college thanks to this Student-designed project, which allows students to find their interest/passions and research them. This kind of project has the possibility to help a lot of students find their passion or at least figure out their options.

People wouldn't like the idea of a student-designed project because students can't consult or get help from a teacher if they run into a problem. I believe that this wouldn't be the case because the whole reason behind a student-designed project is that every project will be different and unique to that student. Students wouldn't need help because the project would be about them, unlike a teacher-designed one.

the beautyÂ of a student-designed project would be the originality of each one of the projects that is the reason why students don't need help on this kind of project, other than directions for it.

In conclusion, a summer project would be best if it was a student-designed one. A student-designed project allows student to find their interests/passions and allows them to explore different interests.

C53073A5A9CB," I would like to discuss a statement made by Thomas Jefferson, which poses the question of whether it is better to be active or idle. In my opinion, being active is the better choice as it allows individuals to achieve their goals and duties more efficiently and effectively.

One of the main reasons why I believe that being active is the better option is that it allows individuals to become accustomed to always doing something. This can be beneficial in various aspects of life, including homework, household chores, and future job responsibilities. On the other hand, being idle does not provide individuals with the opportunity to develop these habits and can hinder their growth and development.

Additionally, active individuals demonstrate values such as determination and responsibility, which are highly valued in the workplace, school, and other settings. They are often seen as dependable and trustworthy, which can lead to opportunities for advancement and success. On the other hand, idle individuals may not be seen as reliable or trustworthy, which can limit their opportunities and hinder their growth.

Furthermore, active individuals are more likely to be successful in their daily lives. They have a clear sense of purpose and direction, which can help them achieve their goals and aspirations. For example, my father started working at a young age and was always doing something, and through hard work and determination, he was able to become his own boss and do what he loved. In contrast, idle individuals may not have a clear sense of purpose and direction, which can make it difficult for them to achieve their goals and aspirations.

In conclusion, I believe that being active is the better choice as it allows individuals to achieve their goals and duties more efficiently and effectively. It also demonstrates values such as determination and responsibility, which are highly valued in various settings. Furthermore, active individuals are more likely to be successful in their daily lives.

46BA696395F4,"My thoughts on the google driverless car is simple. Once they are truly able to be autonomus and safe then you can put them out on the streets. So as of right now I think that they should not be on the streets. Stating my opinion and further explain I think that they will never get to a point full reliablity.

But once they are affordable for the average person. I know that people will but them like hot cakes. But what happens when an coustomer that has a self driving car hits a person without a self driving car; the car company and every one involved in the accident will go to court and fight. The car company will come out on top though; the big name car company will fight so hard that they will get a bill passed that bans all humans from driving!

This is also a reason that I am not for driverless cars. I dont want to be the person that is taken to the supreme court and goes against a big name car company, I dont wish that upon any one. I feel as If 90% is not enough for a car to be in charge. The car can not go through enough simulations to know how to travel through white out conditions, or even dangerous off road terrains. When you truly think about the cost and the time to get these on the road its not worth it. I would compare this to texting and driving how many teenagers had to die before we realised it was a problem?

How many will have to die for this inovation. We are not ready for this technology yet... Or maybe we are to prepared for this.

In this society hackers are becoming more and more dangerous. I know these autonomus cars will have to have google maps or be connceted to some kind of network. What happens when cars start getting hacked and maipulated what do we do about? What kind of insurance would be needed and how expensive would it be?

Even though I am against this, I still reconginze that there could be positives to this. Every day driving tasks would be handled in a fluid and orgainzed manor. When you are in the car you could truly connect with the people inside. Long trips would turn into exiting family times. There would be no need for all seats of a car facing forward.

Now refelecting on what I wrote I have realised that there is more that just safety in Inovative decisions. You have to consider what the majority of the people want. I know that many people will like this idea. My generation would be all over this, we are just a bunch of lazy tech heads. I think that self driving cars will connect with many people.

9C1B60E737FB,"Hey there!  So, I'm supposed to write an essay about this quote from Thomas Jefferson, right?  Like, I'm not exactly sure what to say, but I'll give it a shot. 

Okay, so the quote is ""much may be done if we are always on it nonstop.""  It's pretty deep, you know? Like, it's saying that if we're always working and never taking breaks, we can accomplish so much. But, like, is that really true? 

I mean, I know I'm not the most active person in the world.  I like to take breaks and relax, you know? Watch TV, play video games, hang out with friends.  And I'm not gonna lie, sometimes I get bored when I'm stuck inside doing work all the time. 

But, like, I guess there are some benefits to being inactive sometimes.  Like, when I'm not doing anything, I can just chill and recharge my brain.  It's like, my brain needs a break from all the constant learning and thinking and stuff.  And, like, taking breaks can actually make me more productive when I get back to work. 

But, like, there are also some potential pitfalls to being inactive.  Like, if you're always taking breaks and never getting anything done, you're not really accomplishing anything.  And, like, it can be hard to get back into the swing of things after you've been away from work for a while. 

So, like, I guess the question is, can people accomplish more if they're working all the time or taking breaks?  I mean, it's hard to say for sure, but I think it's probably a mix of both.

At first I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. I really enjoyed it ,so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. In band, I learned how to play the recorder. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade.

Since I didnt really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade.

By participating in community service, students gain valuable skills and learn more about their community. But, some argue that this should not be a requirement for students, stating that it is too much work. 

On the one hand, community service is a good way for students to develop important skills such as communication, problem solving, and collaboration. It can also lead to improved student engagement and higher success levels since students are actively involved in their community. Moreover, service activities provide a great way to learn more about the world around them and how they can make a difference.

On the other hand, opponents to mandatory community service argue that it is a burden for students, taking away valuable time that could be spent studying or doing other activities. Additionally, it can be a challenge for students to find community service opportunities that align with their interests and that provide meaningful experiences.

547D92E1FFA5,"Dear Mrs. Principal,

Cell phones should be allowed at school. Kids could be in an emergency and need to call for help. Kids can also use cell phones for getting a ride. Those are my reasons for cell phones being absolutely necessary in school.

I believe it is necessary for students to be able to use their phones at school. If they were not able to have phone at school then they could not be able to call for help if they are kidnapped. Kids could also need to call the cops and report that someone is being mugged or robbed. There could be someone with a gun at school getting ready to blow peoples brains out with a cell phone they could call the cops and have them save everyone. Kids could be separated from their group on a field trip and need to call to set up a place to regroup.

There are other reasons to like if their parents forgot to pick them up from school one day then they could call them and ask for a ride home. They could also call to let parents know they are going to a friends house after school so their parents could pick them up later. Kids could go on a field trip and need to get a ride home from someone who they know. Kids could need to tell someone their bus crashed, and there are a bunch of kids stuck on the side of the road who need rides home.

Cell phones are a part of everyday life why should they not be allowed at school. If people can use them at work why can't students use them at school? Cell phones are a part of life that are now a necessity to live in this modern world. Kids need them to Get ride to places and to use in an emergence.

CA5F9BF59047,"Dear Principal:

I believe you should go with Policy 2. When students bring cell phones to school they use them during down time in class. They text while teachers are talking. This can disturb the learning environment. Students will be distracted by texts they get and will want to respond. They can also pretend to be doing work and be on their phones. There is no way to enforce the rule of having cell phones to school.

Also, with cell phones in school; rumors spread around faster. This can harm a student's reputation. Cyber bullying can also take place. If the students have the resources around them to do it, they will.

Lastly, i believe no cell phones should be in school because it makes teachers jobs harder. They have to teach and watch for phones. It also makes learning harder for students. They become distracted from learning. It can lower test grades; which can make school funding go down.

Students being distracted, teachers on the lookout, and possibly lower test grades is why no cell phones should be allowed in school.

DAECE15EE507,"Hey, so for this essay, I had to research how small acts of kindness can make a difference in someone's life. And let me tell you, it's a lot more than you might think!

First of all, small acts of kindness can totally brighten someone's day. Like, think about it. When you're feeling down, the last thing you want to do is run into someone who's being mean or rude. But if someone smiles at you or holds the door open for you, it's like, whoa, that totally made my day better! And it's not just about the person who's being kind, it's about how it makes you feel too. It's like, you're not alone, you know? Someone's got your back.

And it's not just about big things either. Like, my mom always says that even just listening to someone can make a big difference. When someone's going through a tough time, it's easy to just ignore them or walk away. But if you take the time to listen to them, really listen, it can be like, wow, this person actually cares about me. And it's not just about solving the problem, it's about feeling like someone's got your back.

But here's the thing: small acts of kindness don't just make a difference in someone's life, they can also spread. Like, if you're nice to someone, they're more likely to be nice to someone else, and then someone else, and so on. It's like, this whole domino effect of kindness! And before you know it, the whole world is a better place.

And it's not just about big acts of kindness either. Like, my friend Sarah always makes sure to hold the elevator door open for people, even if it's just one person. And it's not like she's doing it to be famous or anything, she's just doing it because she knows it's the right thing to do. And it's not just about the person she's helping, it's about the whole vibe of the building.

D8E4CB99DD3F,"I do not think it is fair for only B Grades may have fun activities. All students should be able to have at least one sport or activity. If they didn't have sports or activities they may get over weight or not be used to physical activity. I think i is very unhealthy and totally unfair to other students in the school. Yes, it may be good so students may get their grades up, but some people may not be able to. Also its very unhealthy what if the student does get a B grade after so long of not exercising and they finally get to play but they are not used to it. It may cause some serious trouble for the students heart and body.

Actually I personally think it is an awful idea no matter what the grade students should at least get exercise everyday at least 30 minutes. It is better than nothing. Plus It is good for the body. So it can get used to exercising and be healthy. They can get healthier everyday just by a little activity and/or sport(s). Also what if they never get a B grade? They may later on they may have to do a lot of physical activity and they may not be used to it! So basically earlier activities basically help them for later on in the future.

I think it unfair also because its part of the school to have physical activities for kids to enjoy and become healthier and stronger. What if most of the school had less then a B grade? You wouldn't see a lot of kids running around only a few. Its unfair also because they need exercise to be fit and not gain weight or become overweight. So at least let all grade averages have physical activity and sports they may not have earned it but it would be better for them. In the future. Trust me kids without sports and activities would be very boring and very unhealthy.

So i think the principle should undo the changes in the school. It is positively wrong and shouldn't be done under any circumstances. Kids should be able to run around and play sports they may enjoy. Having exercise is probably saving that kids life from gaining weight and having an unhealthy heart. Its the best for the kids and the school! Maybe later on it will pay off eventually. Like in other schools and higher grades with harder times. Its the best for those kids they need to run and build up some muscle so they wont be so weak and/or have an unhealthy life.",0,persuade_corpus,,8

Although you can meet many new friends at school, you may not even get to see those friends at school. Students would benefit from taking classes at home because they can learn at their own pace, they do not have to worry about bullies, and allows more free time.

Students can learn at their own pace at home. Some students are ahead of the curve and always finish their work early. This would allow those students to get ahead and perhaps even skip a grade. On the other end some students work slower than others and are always behind in class. This would allow those students to have more time to learn and get their work done. Learning at home would really help students who are behind and students who are ahead because it would allow them to work at their own pace.

Another benefit from learning at home would be students would not have to worry about being bullied. Some students are scared to go to school each morning. They are scared they will get picked on or get beat up. Some students spend more time worried about bullies than their actual work. But, if students could learn from home it would completely eliminate the opportunity to get bullied.

Learning at home would allow students more free time. Giving students the option to finish all of their work in three to four hours would be really good. Students would be very motivated to finish their work so they can hang out with friends, play or xbox, or just be lazy around the house. If you work hard enough you can finish all of the work assigned in school in a pretty short amount of time. But, when you are at school you have to be there that seven hours no matter what.

In conclusion, taking classes at home would greatly benefit many students. This would allow students more free time, it would prevent bullies, and it would allow them to work at their own pace. To help all students you need to ask your local principals if they will ever consider giving students the chance of working from home.",0,persuade_corpus,,0

Distracted drivers kill one in ten people everyday in the United States and injure 1500. Texting is one of the main distractions that cause these drives to kill and injure people. While texting you aren't focused on things that matter like the road and that causes these types of accidents to happen. People don't realize how serious this is, the driver might lose control of the car and their reaction time won't be fast enough. In 2011, accidents involving a distracted driver killed 3,331 people.

Habits like texting and driving are important to break. An example of a simple solution to this problem is to simply turn off your phone, it will block out buzzers or vibrations that will tempt anyone to check their phone. Many states in the United States have already passed the no texting and driving law. People still believe that texting and driving is no big deal and have confidence they can text and drive simultaneously. However. Lots of teens spend 15% of their time not in their lane.

With the advanced technology we have today, we should be using voice activated responses and apps to tell people when someone is driving and they'll get to them shortly. Preventing texting and driving can be a simple problem to overcome but very difficult. But if everyone works hard to make it happen we could be saving many lives everyday.

On the Facial Action Coding System would not be bad if you could shut it off and on other then it being on non stop all day tring to read your face.

When people are using their cell phones that what causes a car crash. The way people get in a car crash is when they driving and looking at the cell phone to text people back they look away for a good amount of second that a car can switch to their line and because the person on their cell phone they would see in till it is to late. people shouldn't use their cell phone because most death are because or the cell phone. But at a stop light I think people are able to look at their cell phone and use it because you are not moving or anything you are just in one spot, so you won't hit anything and you do got time to use their cell phone because the light takes forever to change to green. So to me I disagree that using your cell phone while driving should be a no go because that's how much of the people get a ticket or get into a car crash that sometimes they get hurt or they hurt others so that's why it think driving while using your phone should be banned.

Not all the students understand the lesson all the time so they just dont do the work, but with this tool in the class room the computer would see that the student is not understanding and will change the lesson so thst eveyone gets it and is on task doing there work.

I dont feel that this should be used for anything else but to read students emotional expressions in class. This is helpful to the teacher aswell because not all the time do they see the ones that are not understanding what is going on because as long as most of the students are getting the esson they don't see the one's who are not. Most students who dont understand the work will not say anything and just sit there and look like they know what is going on but don't. So this will be good for picking them out so that they can get all the help they need. This is also good for when a teacher might feel like noone gets the work because of how the class looks even though they all understand it they just dont look like it the computer would let the teacher know that everyone is fine with the work and understands it.

In conclusion i do feel that this new technology would be good for all schools and that it would be a big help.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
9392782539BD,"Self driving cars in my opinion is a cool consept and could become succeful in later years but in my eye are technology is not advance enough for this to work out. In my opinion society is still not ready for this type of tehchnology nor are they willing to be wise with it. Self drivin car may help drivers in some way but nothing is perfect including these cars. Kinks in the these car are always going to be present so may be fixable some may not. These problems or kinks could be small or really big. My reasonig are as followed.

Self drivin car are going to be dirvin be technology sensors and a mainframe to recieve this data as talk about in paragraphs 5 but these sensors and computer hardware and software are not gonig to last forever like almost everything it going to break. Lets say this software breaks in the middle of the freeway or while driving through traffic not only do you put your self at risk but the people around you as well. In addition to this, the car will have to be driven manually and is going to have to be fixed and the self driving car will no longer be a self driving car till it is fixed and in my experience with computer software and hardware its not cheep to get it fixed and to imagine getting software that complex fixed is going to come at a high cost. There is also another risk to using this technology, hackers they could hack into your automotive's hardware system and cause many problems on the road. Weather also play a key component the heat could overheat the system, the rain could fry it, cold could freeze it and brake it and etc. Also the cars inablitiy to drive hazardous roads which is inform to us in paragraph 7 means that the switch be autopiolt to manual is going to have to happen this appens in other modes of transportation like airplanes. But given that not all drivers are reasponsible enough to always chhep there eye on the road when they are driving imagine them going at 30 miles per hour not paying attention and the car switches to manual.

I think it would be a great idea because if we get bored then it can change pace or something to make us energisted and the computer could help if you are confused.

the computer could change its pace so we dont get bored. for example if you are sitting in math class working on your computer and you start falling asleep, but if we had this in our class. the machine will keep us awake. ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored ...""(6).

second if you get confused and a teacher is helping another student your computer could help you with that problem, but i do see where other people are coming from with it envades privacy and it not ethical but i don't belive it for a minute.

946D88B6450F,"Transportation has been a part of society for as long as the worlds been turning. It all depends what mode of transport you are willing to take on a daily basis. Cars are becoming fewer and fewer in some places of the past few years. People are less dependant on personal transportation which in turn creates a safer, healthier enviroment for ourselves and the others around us.

By limiting car usage the main reaction would be less pollution and less smog in largeer cities. Places like New York, Paris, Berlin, London, or Beijing could look so much better. Everywhere you look you see and hear about pollution and Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming. All this is caused mainly by humans hand and the cars we drive spitting out toxic Carbon Dioxide wastes. In Paris they had a one day ban of half the cars in the city and the smog went away in that amount fo time.(Source 2) If we limited cars we could unlimit our world to a new, longer lifespan, because cars are truly ripping our planet to pieces.

The chance of finding public transportation in America is very slim. Most places you go don't have subways or things like ""der U-Bahn"" in Deutschland. Our counrty is made for cars and we throw money at them every year which will eventually come to bite America in the butt. 80 percent of appropriations have gone to higways and the rest goes to other types of transport in America.(Source 1) By creating more viable public tansportation methods we could cut the spending on highways and put the money back into public transportation. By doing so we could limit accidents at the wheel and reduce pollution which I mentioned earlier. We already know that this system works in Vauban, Deutschland where residents rarely own cars and they live happier, quainter lives. (Source 1)

The time to by a car is not now. Recent studies show that car purchases, licenses, and driving has become fewer as each year goes on.(Source 4) Either from high vehicle and gas prices or an actual social spectical, driving is slowly decreasing all over the world. Hopefully within the next 25 years, public transportation will be a MUST in cities all over the globe, and I'm not just talking about buses. People are more reliant on planes and trains in Europe than any other continent. And we could benefit highly from what we learn elsewhere.

If we just join together and stop driving alltogether for just one day, the results would be both extraordianry and frightening. We have neglected to see that by not limiting our car usage we have limited our time on this planet. Hopefully our generation will correct the wronging of past generations and improve transportation so it isn't such a loud and obnoxtious hinderence.Â        Â        Â     ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

5D2FE04CFD4C,"Mobile phone use while driving is very common. It is widely considered ver dangerous to drive while on your phone. It has been a numerous numbers of crashes while people have been driving and on a cellphone. Some people might feel that driving while on cellphone is okay, but it has been reported to be illegal. Overall using a cellphone increases driver's risk of causing a crash or death to a family, or person. Driver's are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more crashes.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not just yourself. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cellphones whether they want to or not. Driving is a privilege and some people take it for granted.

Driving you have to be very careful for yourself and for other drivers. One minute you're here and next your gone because you were on your phone or not paying attention to the road or other drivers that driving on the other side of the road or by you. It is only a matter of seconds before you are dead and gone.

Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road. Of all related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity while driving. Texting while driving is becoming a life-threatening norm for people driving. With inexperienced drivers with lack of skills, cell phones use can especially deadly for teen drivers. It has been many deaths from car crashes while on a cellphone. Adults for the most part can't ever stay of their phones, cause every time I'm driving I see it.

In conclusion because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced parents need to take action. It isn't a good idea for you to drive while on the phone because it can cause serious danger. Also parents should avoid calling their teen while he or she is driving. Instead ask to be called before leaving one place and when arriving at the next destination. A teen may feel attempted to answer a parent's call if received while driving.

500f8468bb7c_04112023,"While distance learning provides greater flexibility and convenience, I believe that attending classes in person still offers students important benefits.

There are several advantages to distance learning that allow students to learn from home. It gives those with health issues or disabilities, who struggle to attend a physical school, the opportunity to continue their education. It can also help students who have commitments like jobs or family responsibilities balance school with their other obligations. Distance learning provides flexibility that a traditional classroom does not. 

However, learning in person has advantages that distance learning lacks. Physical classrooms foster collaboration and interaction between students. Discussing concepts with peers and asking teachers immediate questions aids understanding. It also helps students develop important social and communication skills. Being physically present helps concentrate students and stay engaged with lessons. Subtle aspects of learning like body language, facial expressions and group projects are missed online. 

Additionally, attending school introduces structure and routine that distance learning may lack. It's easier for students learning at home to become distracted or fall behind without the accountability of physically being in class. The social environment of school also has mental health benefits for developing students. 

While distance learning expands access to education, the in-person classroom experience remains integral to learning for many students. It cultivates focus, social skills and collaboration in ways online school struggles to replicate. For most students, especially younger ones, the structure, interaction and community of a physical school provides the optimal environment for academic and personal growth. Therefore, I believe the traditional classroom model remains the preferred option for students unless distance learning becomes absolutely necessary due to health or scheduling constraints. A blended approach combining both options utilises the strengths of each.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,5
falcon_180b_v1_94,"Arts education has always been a subject of discussion among educators, policymakers, and parents. While some people believe that it is essential for a well-rounded education, others argue that it should be optional. However, I believe that arts education is an integral part of a holistic education and should not be ignored.

Firstly, arts education enhances students' creativity and critical thinking skills. It teaches them to think beyond the conventional methods and come up with unique ideas. For instance, painting, drawing, and sculpturing help students to develop their imagination and creativity. Similarly, theater and dance help students to explore their artistic abilities and improve their problem-solving skills. Therefore, by providing arts education, we can foster the next generation of innovators and thinkers.

Secondly, arts education promotes cultural appreciation and diversity. Students learn about different cultures and traditions through music, theater, and dance. Arts education helps students to understand and appreciate the diversity in our society. For example, learning traditional music and dance from different cultures can promote cultural understanding and respect. Therefore, we can create a more inclusive society by providing arts education.

Thirdly, arts education contributes to the overall academic success of students. Research shows that students who participate in arts education tend to have better academic performance, higher grades, and lower dropout rates. For example, a study conducted by the Arts Education Partnership found that students who participate in arts education are more engaged in school and have a higher level of motivation. Therefore, arts education can be an essential tool to improve the academic outcomes of students.

In conclusion, arts education is essential for a well-rounded education. It helps to foster creativity, diversity, and academic success. Therefore, we should prioritize arts education and provide opportunities for all students to engage in it. We can create a better future by ensuring that students have access to a comprehensive education that includes arts education.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Many people believe that arts education is essential for a well-rounded education, while others think that it should be optional.

23C916766386,"I think that this type of technology could be very helpful but it could also be very scary if it isn't used properly. But, if it is only used for classroom use I think it could be very effective. There are plenty of ways this new technology could help schools help students learn better. Especially, if it could help kids learn the best way they can.

Face recognition is also used in the new IPhone X and there are already a whole bunch of new conspiracy theories about it. I think that is because humans have never seen this kind of technology used before, which can lead us to overthink and come up with crazy ideas in our heads because we don't fully understand this new technology. I feel as though Facial Action Coding System would get the same reaction at first which could probably affect schooling in general. Parents might hear negative stuff about this new technology and send their kids to different schools or start home schooling them, which would not be very good for the school's image. Of course, the talk would die down at some point but people might still be reluctant at first.

On the other hand, I think once all the suspicions do die down it would be a tremendous help to the school. As the passage was saying, that it could recognize if the student is getting bored it could change the way the lesson is being taught. I think this would help because everyone learns in a different way. It also was talking about if the student was confused and I was thinking maybe they could even just re-word how the lesson is explaining the material.

But, I do think the ad thing could be kind of annoying. Yes, it might help somewhat, but I, as do many other people, don't really like ads to begin with. Especially if they just pop up out of nowhere and onto my screen. It could help promote more things but I don't think that most people that are on the recieving end of these ads would be very fond of the idea.

In conclusion, I think that this technology could be very helpful ,maybe even cool, if used correctly and with a lot of testing and patience. You're gonna need patience because of all the theories I talked about because no one knows how long that could last. But, nevertheless, I think that it would be entirely worth it.

The face on Mars is fake because on the day the face was first seen, outside was verry foggy.

This means that the cameras would have to see through haze.

However some still thought that the face was made by aliens, even though it was winter and in bad wheather.

Then later we took a picture of the face on a clear day and didnt see a face.

This makes me think that there has never been a face on Mars

Another reason that I think that the face on Mars is fake is because the statue was to be aproxamently two miles long and maybe even longer.

This makes it seen unreasonably tall.

If the face were to be two miles tall then that would mean that many of the other rocks would be smaller, but they are not actually the surrounding rocks are much bigger.

My last reason that I think that there isnt a face is because our pictures arn't the best.

The cameras that took the original picture took 43 meters per pixel, and the camera that took the picture in 2001 made a pixel every 1.56 meters.

This leads to the fact that no face had ever been found on Mars.

Only the camera made it look like a face.

The fog made it nearly impossable for the camera to take a clear picture of the mountain on Mars.

The face was also suposed to be about two miles tall which means that this mould be a verry big rock, but the rock besides it is much bigger then it.

The old cameras that NASA owned were bad compared to what the more modern pictures were taken with.

AC729925620C,"When it comes to advice, who should we ask? Some of us may have a best friend or a trusted adult that we talk to about certain feelings, but maybe seeking advice from multiple people is more beneficial. Talking to different types of people gives others the opportunity to view things from different perspectives. Perhaps, the person giving advice has already been in that situation. Or, someone disagrees with the advice a specific person gives. There are many reasons to get opinions from more than one person.

Different types of people will, of course, have different opinions, perspectives, and thoughts on the advice they are asked for. Religious beliefs, logic, and their environment, will all play an important role for their answer. For example, the advice seeker's mother most likely won't have the same answer as their father. And a police officer wouldn't have the same ideas as a chemist. Ideas can vary from person to person.

Another idea to expand on, is the fact that others may have already experienced what the advice seeker is asking about. For instance, someone who has never been to an amusement park is nervous about the different rides and ask their friend, who has visited the place many times, whether they should be afraid or not. They tell them it can be a bit scary at first, but after the second or third time, they'll get used to it. That would be an example of how getting advice from others with experience is a good idea.

The last reason to seek advice from a large range of people, is because a disagreement could occur. Looking at advice from another perspective can be a positive experience, but there could always be a chance the advice seeker does not agree with the person giving the advice. A solution to this would be observing how others would react to the situation, and getting an overall view of how they should handle it. There's even a possibility that they rethink what the first person told them because they also disliked the other advice they were given.

So, in conclusion, advice can be seen from many different viewpoints. Certain factors, such as religion, the logic that person uses, and how they grew up, all affect the way someone thinks, resulting in a different answer than, say, the next door neighbor. It's good to be able to find and communicate with people who have already been in the situation, that way, it makes looking for the right answer much less difficult. Though, there are also times when an advice seeker just doesn't agree with the answer they are given. In that case, having different people to share and receive ideas with is important not only the advice seeker, but the advice giver.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

llama_70b_v1187,"Dear Mrs. Smith,

I know your thinking about changing the policy so that we have to have a least a B average to play sports or do other activities. I think this is a bad idea and I'll tell you why.

First of all, not every one is good at school. Some people are really good at sports or music or art, but they might not be so good at school. If they can't play sports or do other things they like, they might get discouraged and stop trying altogether.

Second, having a C average is still pretty good! It's not like were failing or anything. And some people might be trying really hard and still only get a C. That's not fair to punish them for something they can't control.

Third, sports and other activities are important too! They help us learn teamwork and discipline and how to work hard. They also help us relax and have fun. Taking that away from us just because were not the best at school isn't right.

I think you should reconsider this idea and find a different way to help students do better in school. Maybe you could give us more help or support, or find a way to make school more interesting and fun.

Firstly, failure can provide motivation. When we fail, we are often pushed to work harder and strive for better. This push can come from within ourselves, as we realize that we need to improve in order to succeed, or it can come from external sources, such as our peers or teachers. For example, when I failed my first math test, I was determined to improve my skills and study harder for my next test. This determination led me to ultimately succeed in the subject, and I have since gone on to excel in math.

Secondly, failure can provide the chance to improve. When we fail, we are often given the opportunity to learn from our mistakes and make changes to our approach. This can lead to better outcomes in the future. For example, when I failed my first attempt at a science experiment, I took the time to analyze what went wrong and made changes to my approach for my next attempt. This led to a successful outcome, and I was able to learn valuable skills in the process.

Finally, failure can provide experience. When we fail, we are often forced to face challenges and learn how to overcome them. This can lead to valuable life experiences that can be applied in many different situations. For example, when I failed my first job interview, I took the time to reflect on my strengths and weaknesses and made changes to my approach for future interviews. This led to a successful outcome, and I was able to learn valuable skills that I have applied in many different situations.

In conclusion, failure can be used as an aid on the road to success. Failure can provide motivation, the chance to improve, and the potential for experience. By embracing failure and using it as a learning opportunity, we can ultimately succeed in our endeavors.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,2
827D807512AB,"Winston Churchill famously said that ""success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" Indeed, failure is an integral part of the pursuit of success, and understanding why is essential to maximizing your potential. Not many people are a failure of their success because, with the right approach, failure can be used to inform our decisions and propel us to heights we would never have achieved without it. 

The first example of why not many people are a failure of their success is perseverance. The individuals who refuse to give up in the face of adversity are the ones who can achieve great things. Thomas Edison failed more than 1,000 times in his pursuit of the right combination of materials to make a reliable and durable light bulb, yet he kept trying until he achieved his goal. His ability to persevere through failure was the key to success in the end. 

The second example of why not many people are a failure of their success is resilience. Those who can stay focused when under pressure, avoid giving up, and keep their vision alive will eventually be rewarded. For example, when Steve Jobs was fired from Apple in 1985, he had to start over from scratch. After all the failure and setbacks, he eventually returned to build one of the most successful companies in the world. 

Many people are also inspired by what they are going, and using failure as an opportunity to learn and grow can be especially empowering. Every time we fail, we get a chance to re-evaluate and adjust our strategies, develop new skills, and become more knowledgeable and determined. For instance, after Oprah Winfrey was fired from her television job at the age of 22, she used the experience to her advantage. She was determined to make something out of the failure and learn from it, and thatâs exactly what she did. 

Finally, many people are drawn to failure because it provides a sense of achievement. Facing failure is not easy, but it encourages us to reach beyond our comfort zone and accomplish something extraordinary. Consider Amelia Earhart, who wanted to make history and become the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She accepted failure as part of the process, and used her courage and determination to make her dream come true. 

In conclusion, failure can play an important role in the pursuit of success, if we choose to take advantage of it. By being resilient, inspired, and",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

A49E1A5FA91B,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing you a letter in regards of the electoral college. I believe we should abolish it completely. I believe that we should change our voting system to election by popular vote for the president of the United Sates. While it is a good system, it is not reliable and does not let the people truly decide who their representative will be. It does bring some certainty of outcome but not as much as it should.

The electoral college must be abolished because it does not let the people truly decide who their president will be. While it does allow them to vote for a slate of electors who then elect the president usually based off of the popular vote, they do not always vote for who they are supposed to. The slate of electors that the people vote for are supposed to be trusted to vote for what the popular vote says, they do not always do so. A good example of that is in 2000, when Al Gore ran against George W Bush. Al Gore won the popular vote nationwide over Bush, he still didnt win the presidency because the electoral college did not stay true to their word and voted for Bush. That is because, as shown in Source 3, paragraph 15, "" When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. So while you might think your individual vote makes a difference, it doesnt at all, for you are not choosing which presidential candidate to vote for, you are voting for someone else to vote for the president who might not always stay true to their word and vote for a different candidate.

Although the electoral college does bring better certainty of outcome than a popular vote, it does not have the certainty it claims to have. In Source 2, paragraph 12 it states, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" This is a big worry because the electoral college holds a total of 538 votes which is definetely possible to cause a tie. If this were to happen, then the vote would be thrown to the House of Representatives where state delegations would vote on the president. Then the concept of the presidential campaigns would become pointless because the point of campaining is to try to win over large, swing states to ensure more votes. Because the bigger the states population, the more votes they hold in the electoral college. But that would only work if it was in the Senates hands because the amount of representatives in the Senate for each state is based off of population, whereas the amount of representatives in the House of Representatives is always two for each state. So if the vote was thrown into the House of Representatives hands, then whichever candidate who holds claim over the most states, regardless of size, would almost automatically win the election because each state holds equal say in their vote.

So because the electoral college is obviously unfair, it should be abolished. Because the voters are told they decide who reopresents them, yet they do not. There is a possibility, while slim that a president could win the popular votes, yet lose the election because of the way the electoral college is set up. So because it unfair to the presidential candidates, it should be abolished and we should have elections controlled by popular votes.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

Hey there!  As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write this essay about the history of soccer and how it relates to physical education.  I know, I know, it might seem like a weird combination, but trust me, it's actually pretty cool! ð

So, did you know that soccer has been around for like, forever?  It originated in ancient civilizations like Egypt, China, and Greece! ð¤¯ It's crazy to think about how a sport that's so popular today has such a rich history. 

But here's the thing: soccer isn't just some ancient game that we play for fun.  It's actually a great way to build skills like teamwork, speed, and agility!  When you play soccer, you have to work together with your teammates to score goals and defend your team's net.  It's like a big game of tag, but with better ball handling skills! ð

And get this: research shows that participating in physical education can actually lead to enjoyment!  Like, who knew?! It's not just about running laps or doing push-ups.  It's about having fun and staying active.  When you're having fun, you're more likely to stick with it and make it a part of your daily routine. 

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But wait, don't the rules of physical education and soccer clash?""  Not really!  Both involve working together as a team, but the rules of soccer are actually more relaxed than you might think.  For example, in soccer, you can use your hands to control the ball, but in physical education, you have to stay inside the designated playing area.  It's all about finding that balance between having fun and following the rules.

I think Policy 1 would be a good idea ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class"". As long as the phones are off during calls then kids should be allowed to use then during lunch and floor time. Sense the rules changed and we are no longer allowed to go to the bathrooms we have to stay in class then we should be able to at least text and play games. I do not see why we are not allowed to use phones at floor. it really does not change anything except for the fact that it would keep most of us quiet. Half of the school brings there phones into class anyway. They text, go on face book, play games, some even talk on the phone. Most kids go to the bathroom to text and talk to people so I think that you should at least let people use there phones at floor. because that would probably stop most of them from texting during class if they can look forward to texting during floor and lunch time and other free times they have during school hours.

State Senato r,

I think that the Electoral College should change to popular votes for the president and I have a few reasons why: When people vote for a president they are actually voting for the Electoral College and the Electoral College votes for the president themselves and sometimes the voters vote for the wrong canidate and the presindent they wanted to vote for might not win the election, Some states do not get to see their canidates or the election and don't know who to vote for. I think that voters should be able to vote who they want to run our country and not have the Electoral College decide for them. They have a voice and a mind to their own and I believe that we should have a say on who should be our president, our leader, someone who will stop ISIS and to stop terroists and bombings, someone who will pass laws that child abuse should be illegal. It can be argued that the Electoral Colleges method of selecting the president might turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Candidates have a winner-take-all system and its unfair because they do not spend time in states that they know will have no chance winning. I think that they should give them a chance, just because they think that they can;t win it doesn't make it tur, its more of their opinion. The Electoral College is unfair to voters, outdated, and irrational. The Electoral College won the popular vote but lost the presidency. The voters would prefer a direct election.

darragh_claude_v7_767,"While distance learning provides flexibility, attending classes from home does not offer all of the same benefits as in-person learning. There are a few key reasons why in-person classes are often preferable for students. 

One major advantage of in-person classes is the social interaction and collaboration that occurs. In a traditional classroom setting, students can work together on group projects, have discussions with their peers, and build social relationships. Distance learning removes these opportunities for real-time collaboration and relationship building. Many students benefit from the socialization that comes with attending school in person. 

Another benefit of the classroom is accountability. When attending classes at school, students have set class times each day that keep them on a routine and schedule. It can be easier for students attending classes from home to become distracted or procrastinate schoolwork without this structure. Distance learning requires more self-discipline from students to stay focused on their work without in-person supervision. 

Additionally, in-person classes allow for more direct support from teachers. When students have questions or need help, teachers are immediately available to provide guidance, feedback and assistance. Distance learning puts more responsibility on students to independently seek help as needed. Some students may struggle without the face-to-face support of their teachers. 

While distance learning provides flexibility that can help students in some situations, attending classes in the traditional classroom setting tends to offer higher accountability, opportunities for collaboration, and support from both teachers and peers that benefit many students. Overall, for most students, in-person classes better support learning and development. However, distance learning could be useful as a supplement or option for some highly self-motivated students. A combination of both models may work best to support all types of learners.",1,darragh_claude_v7,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

If someone were to ask me about this in a public place, I would likely agree with Winston's statement. After reading more about it and thinking about it, I believe that success is indeed dependent on maintaining enthusiasm in the face of failure.

In my experience, I have found that it is often the individuals who have failed and then managed to get back up that truly understand the importance of enthusiasm in achieving success. It can be difficult for some people to accept this, but eventually, I believe that most people would come to agree with Winston's statement if they were to reflect on their own experiences with failure and success.

While this may not be true for everyone, I believe that Winston's statement holds a lot of wisdom and is a very valuable piece of advice for anyone looking to achieve success in their lives. It is important to remember that failure is a natural part of the journey to success, and it is up to us to maintain our enthusiasm and keep pushing forward, even in the face of adversity.

AC06F13B54DD,"The Problem of Distracted Driving

Being on the phone while driving has become a nationwide problem. This problem is due to the increase of the relationship between phone and man. Humans have become more in tuned with their phones rather than paying attention to what is happening in front of them. The cell phone makes the driver lose focus of the road causing many problems. People should not be allowed to use the phone while driving because lives are being loss while people are texting and driving and it is dangerous for everyone on the road. There are two main solutions for preventing using the phone while driving which are either having more police patrol units out to help monitor the roads or having the person set up a self-control system for themselves.

The first prevention method is to have more police patrolling the roads as a way of moderating cell phone usage while people are driving. When people see the police, there is an instant nervous feeling that follows. Instilling fear of tickets or even the idea of going to jail within the people could help control the problem of cell phones and driving. If people see that police are watching, they will instantly do the right thing. Police patrolling can help decrease the numbers of distracted drivers on the road, ensure the safety of the drivers themselves and the people around them.

Setting up units around the road could not only help with distracted driving but also help with situations that put others at risk while being on the road.

These patrol units could be of benefit for numerous problems but distracted driving being the most important. Although it is not an immediate reform to the problem, it is a start for correction.

The final prevention method is to have the people set up self-control systems that not only will ensure the safety of themselves, but the people around them. There are many different systems that can be put in place. One of the first things the driver could do is turn the phone off completely. This will ensure that there is no way the person can use the phone or react to any incoming notifications. If a person is not comfortable with the phone being completely off, then having the phone on silent is the next recommended response to be performed. This can help the driver focus more on the road because the sound of the phone's notifications are not distracting. This is not as effective as turning off the phone because depending on the location of the phone, the driver may be able to see the phone screen light up. If this occurs then the driver can be distracted. The most recommended self-control system is to have the phone completely turned off because it is fully assured that the phone will not be aiding in the problem of distracted driving.

In conclusion, people should not be allowed to use their phones while driving. Driving while distracted is a safety problem that can be corrected. One way of correcting distracted driving with cell phones is to have police units set up on the road watching for any signs of cell phone usage during driving. These police units can ensure the safety of drivers on the road and even pedestrians. There is also the method of drivers setting up their own self-control system. These systems allow for the driver to be responsible for his or her own actions that help with the reforms of distracted driving. The two systems are turning the phone off or having the phone on silent. Turning the phone off is a secure solution for distracted driving because the driver will not have any interaction with the phone. Silencing the phone is the next recommended solution because this allows for the diver to concentrate on the road with a clear mind. These solutions to the problem of distracted driving may not be immediate, but they are a start to helping decrease the dangers that are triggered when distracted driving occurs.

EDBC0E9475DD,"Why Students Should do a Extra Curricular Activity

Have you ever been stressed and need something to clear your mind? That is why students should be required to do at least one extra curricular activity. Extra curricular activitiesÂ is a great opportunity that every kid should be required to do because it lets you take your mind of of school and do something that you enjoy with your friends.

Extra curricular activities are a great way to meet new people and practice life skills. I moved to a school this year and I new very few people, but then I joined a extra curricular activity and I met a lot of people. This also means that people from a grade can still hang out with someone from a different grade level. Meeting people gives you great life skills because you learn how to greet people and you learn how to be more social and less shy. This means that people meet a lot of new people and they learn a lot about each other. You also learn their points of view. You learn a lot of different perspectives on how to fix certain problems that our would is facing. With all of those points of views, you can learn the best ways to fix the problems. Some people may say that you can do that outside of an extra curricular activity, but that is wrong because if you go to the grocery store you would not stop every one that is going down the isle and talk to them for 30 minutes. If you were a part of an extra curricular activity, you would have the chance to talk longer because you are with them after school for a long time.

Extra curricular activitiesÂ are also a great way to do something that you enjoy. I joined a extra curricular activity and I am always exited to go there after school and have fun. I love doing it and I would not be able to do it at home. This means that I have a lot of fun doing what I love with new friends that I can hang out with. It also lets you not stress over school and think about something happy and exiting. Some people may say that anything you do at the school you can do at home, but that is not true because some people that go to the public schools can not afford it and even If you did, you would still need to bring people to your house to play it. If you did bring people over to do that it would be the same thing as having it at you school, but worse because it is less convenient and the school pays for the equipment. If you did it at your house you would have to pay. Some parents can not even pick their kids up until a little later so it gives them something fun to do. That is why it is a great way to do something that you enjoy.

Extra curricular activities should also be enforced because it lets people try new things that they may not be able to do at home. It is always good to try new things because you do not know if you like it. You may be really good at it, but you never know until you try. If you hate that extra curricular activity than their are a lot more and I am sure that you will find some that you really love and enjoy. This means that you find something you love and can connect to other people that love that activity as well. Some people may say that you can connect with people that do not do an extra curricular activity, but that is not true because it would be very hard to ask a lot of people what they love to do outside of school. If you do an extra curricular activity, it would be a lot easier to connect and you may end up being great friends at school and maybeÂ even in the future. It is a lot easier to make connections and get to know each other if you spend a lot of time together.

Students should defiantly be forced to participate in extra curricular activities. Extra curricular activities lets kids try new things that they may love. Extra curricular activities also lets you meet new people. Students should defiantly be forced to participate in extra curricular activities.

Its like the man it the moon it is just a landscape it is nothing big at all. By saying that it is an alien people today would probally believe that it is true they would go crazy.

But we found evindence that the first Viking was wrong and the it is just a moutain. Now a days we have new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry ,but back then they didn't have that kind of technology. Technology today can take ten times better pictures then back in 1976.

As the world grows faster in technolog we can expect better and better pictures but we found evindence that on Mars there is no life forms. So as far as we know their are no such thing as aliens. On Mars there might be pictures or thing that looklike an alien but its not it a fairytale our mind thinks it saw one but you never did. As i was saying there is no lifeform on mars,

I think its fair for you to have at least a B average to participate in any sports at school, because if the students participate in any sports activities there not going to want to do there work at school because they would be to focused on the sport than they would there school work they wouldn't get any of there work done. I think a B is good enough because you still passing.

i think school is way more important than sports, because with out school you wont have a good education, sports is good but that's not really going to get you anywhere in life. If a student really wants to participate in any sports activities and they have a C or lower they should do something about it and ask the teacher if they can do anything to improve there grades like extra credit.

That's what i did when i was on the wrestling team my coach was about to kick me off the team because my grades were dropping to C and D but i asked my teacher if i could do anything to fix it and they gave me all of my old test and class work i didn't do so well on and let me try everything again, i brought up most of my grades and my couch said it was good enough, if you really want something you should do whatever you can for you to succeed and to get what you need.

I think that the children should be able to bring their cell phones to school. why? because i think they should be able to call someone incase there is an emergency at school and the school phone is not available at times. When there is an emergency we, the kids, can just have out phones and call for help. I also agree with the thought of having them out at lunch periods. because you know that we like to socialize with our friends. We like to show them our Facebook and stuff like that. At other free times would be nice to have out. So i think that this idea would be nice to have and to keep. Also you would want your students to be happy at school and learning. It really gets me happy when i know that when we have free times ,that we can pull out our phones and be able to talk and have fun in that little amount of time. I'm sure that most of the students would agree with me. Most students would love this idea. To me it just makes sense to bring phones to school. If adults can have free time then why cain't the kids have free time as well. But that's just my opinion about this thing. Like i said moat students would agree with me on this. Just as long as the phones are not distracting to us while we are learning then there should be no problem why we cain't bring them to school. I think that the teachers might think that we might be txting during class and are not staying focused on the work. I think that is the major problem with the teachers.

I have heard about the new cell phone policies that you have been thinking of.

I feel that policy number 2 is the better one of the 2 choices.

hear are a couple of the reasons why I personally think this.

Students enjoy using their phone every day.

I feel that sometimes the can use it a little to much during school.

I think that letting students use their phones during lunch and free time is an excellent idea.

Also students wouldn't be interrupting class every day with their cell phones.

This would be a lot better than just getting rid of cell phones completely.

As principal you might want to consider possibly figuring out a schedule were students have free time during a couple of their classes.

Doing this would not only help the new policy, but keep it going throughout the school year.

students would appreciate it if during a boring class they got a 5-15 minute break to relax and use their phones.

But, there would be some rules behind the free time.

You would have to think of them so that students wouldn't be doing stuff that is against school rules.

So principal please consider the second policy for cell phones at our school.

students do want to use their cell phones and not keep them at home.

Driving a car is easier because when you are late for work or getting somewhere you can get there faster. If you are walking or riding a bike your not going to get there on time a car is faster and quicker to get to places without any trouble. Gas could be high but it is worth it because a lady with three kids could be rushing trying not to be late for work and trying to get her kids ready for school so instead of walking them to school or riding bikes she could just drive them to school and not be late for work. Driving a car is so much easier and quicker.

Traffic with cars is bad but when you need to get places you can drive a car instead of taking the bus that has to stop ten different places. Cars are being banned in Columbia and you can only rideÂ buses orÂ taxis. Taxis can get you where you need to just as fast as your own car can but a bus couldn't because there is always people in front of you that have to get off in different places. They made two seated bikes just for this man and his wife to get around because they didn't want them driving there cars.

Teenagers get there license at a young age now and they start driving. They drive to school and to practices and everywhere else but it could be dangerous because some teenagers just like to goof and round and try to act all bad and then end up hurting them self and somebody else and it would be their fault. Some teens just decide not to get them because it is safe just to ride with their parents instead of them driving and having the chance to get in a wreck and hurt their self and then there car be ruined and won't be able to get a new one. Most teens love to drive because it's fun and they like getting out on there own. Teens like to go out and hang with there friends or go get something to eat. Other people are more worried about there job and social life then trying to get a car so they can drive all the time.

In conclusion, a limiting on car usage should be that they shouldn't have a limiting on car usage because most people are late for stuff when they don't drive there car. Walking and driving a car is way different a car is way faster then walking and trying to get to places on time. That is my opinion on limiting to car usage.

7600F1C7D884," In today's world, technology has made it easier for students to learn from home. However, I believe that attending classes in person provides numerous benefits that cannot be replicated through remote learning.

Firstly, being taught face-to-face allows for a more interactive and engaging learning experience. Students can ask questions, clarify doubts, and receive immediate feedback from their teachers. This type of interaction helps students to better understand the material and retain it for longer periods of time. Additionally, face-to-face learning allows for a more collaborative environment, where students can learn from each other and work together on group projects.

Secondly, attending classes in person provides a sense of community and belonging. Students are surrounded by their peers and teachers, which can help to reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness. This sense of community can also provide a support network for students, where they can share their struggles and receive encouragement from their peers and teachers.

Thirdly, attending classes in person provides a structured learning environment. Students are required to attend classes at specific times and follow a set schedule, which can help to promote discipline and responsibility. This structure can also provide a sense of routine and predictability, which can be beneficial for students who may struggle with time management or organization.

In conclusion, while remote learning has its advantages, attending classes in person provides numerous benefits that cannot be replicated through technology. Face-to-face learning allows for a more interactive and engaging learning experience, provides a sense of community and belonging, and promotes discipline and responsibility.

darragh_claude_v7_995,"Limiting car usage has many benefits for modern societies. According to multiple sources, reducing reliance on personal vehicles can significantly improve public health, the environment, and urban transportation systems.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality and public health. As passages 1 and 2 discuss, vehicle emissions are a leading cause of air pollution in most cities. By driving less and using alternative modes of transportation like biking, walking, and public transit, communities can lower emissions of harmful gases and tiny airborne particles. This results in cleaner, healthier air for all residents to breathe. With less pollution, people are less likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses and disease over time. 

In addition, limiting car use has environmental advantages. As noted in passage 3, automobile dependence negatively impacts natural ecosystems and contributes to climate change. When fewer gas-powered vehicles congest roads and highways each day, it lessens fossil fuel consumption and the volume of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere. With reduced emissions per capita, countries can get closer to achieving emissions reduction targets and mitigating the impacts of global warming. Nature also benefits as surrounding habitats regain some quality of air, water, and livability impaired by vehicle emissions and sprawl over decades.

Finally, curbing car dependency can improve urban infrastructure and transportation flows in crowded cities. As described in passage 4, when mass transit options are more heavily relied on instead of private vehicles, it allows municipalities to reshape road and parking space for other uses. Buses, bikes, and pedestrians require less infrastructure than endless highways and parking lots. Streamlining transportation in this way leads to less traffic, commute times shorten, and space is opened for green developments or other civic projects that serve more people efficiently. 

In summary, limiting car usage produces a wide range of environmental, health, and infrastructure advantages for modern societies. By driving less and embracing alternatives like public transit, biking and walking, communities can significantly boost quality of life and sustainability over the long run. A multi-modal approach balancing various transportation options is clearly better for people and planet than unsustainable automobile dependence.",1,darragh_claude_v7,Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage.

6330EB716872," Kindness: A Powerful Force for Change

Have you ever stopped to consider the impact that kindness can have on others? It's a simple act of giving back, whether it's through a small gesture like holding the door for someone or a larger act like donating to charity. But what is it about kindness that makes it such a powerful force for change?

At its core, kindness is about helping others. It's about putting the needs of others before our own and taking action to make a difference in their lives. But why do we choose to help others? It's because we understand that kindness has the power to create a ripple effect. When we help someone, we're not just making their day better - we're also inspiring them to pay it forward and help others in their own way.

This is why kindness has such a huge impact on others. It's not just about the immediate effects that our actions have on those around us, but also about the long-term effects that those actions can have on the world. By helping others, we're not just making the world a better place for ourselves - we're also making it a better place for future generations.

In conclusion, kindness is a powerful force for change. It's about taking action to make a difference in the lives of others, and inspiring them to do the same.

71756359,"Thousands of Americans use their own car or a vehicle as their main transportation in their every day lives. No one seems to look at how cars are actually destroying the environment ,rather then helping it. Mainly since the fuel that is given off from a vehicles engine is effecting the environment in a negative way. In all reality the reason why we as humans use our own vehicles is because its a faster way of transportation and carries us to our destination. This is why limiting car usage will be beneficial money wise and create a healthier environment.

Reducing the car usage is beneficial to creating a cleaner and safer environment. Not only will this effect the environment but your life as well. According to source 1 it states,"" Passengers cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe."" Based on this fact I can acknowledge the fact of how automobiles can effect the greenhouse. The greenhouse is a cycle in which can have a huge impact on our environment. If we destroy that then that may result in even more damages that are caused now. It also states, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France , after five days of intensifying smog..."" In result, the smog then continued to places such as Bejing, China. Which I personally would consider to be a horrific thing, considering China is very congested already and is one of the most pollued cities in the world. Some may argue of the fact that car usage is their main way from going to point A to point B , but there is proof that is effecting the cities around us. Experts have concluded that there is about 50 percent car intensive areas located in the United States. This is why car usage should be reduced to have create a better environment.

The suburbs are taking action to create denser cities. The purpose of having denser cities is to have a low suburban life. In source 1 it states, "" In this new approach , stores are placed a walk away, on main street, rather than in malls along some distant highways."" This experiment will help to encourage more ways to attempt public transportation. For instance, riding your bicycle once in a blue moon. Not only are you saving money but you are preventing less traffic from occurring in your area. Some may argue having a low suburban life can be hard to adapt to but it will provide a safer environment. Especially since you are one step closer to making the world less polluted then it already is. I personally would agree on occasionally using a different way to get to my destination. It will not only benefit me in the long run but also cause less chaos on the road. It also states in the text,"" the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car ""reduced communties"", and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously."" This means that the Environmental Agency are starting to promote reducing car in certain communities. Some may argue why is there a need to reduce the amount of cars in a community ,but on the other hand that community may be over populated or congested of cars. If this is so, then this will just have another negative impact of the environment. The purpose of the program is to benefit the area you are and to lessen then the issue of car usages. All in all, the suburbs are taking action to create denser cities.

Programs are also being created to spread the news of Car Free day. The purpose for Care Free day in Bogota , Columbia is a day you participate in to prevent traffic jams. For example, In source 3 it states, ""..millions of Colombians hiked, biked, and skated or took buses to work during a car free day."" This day isn't ment for people who live in Bogota, Colombia but they are trying to influence this tradition in several other countires. Other may agree of this day being pointless , but I can see this having a huge impact on the world. Sooner or later this day will become a tradition not only in several other countries but also in the United States. it also states in source 3,"" Its a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pulltion, said a bussniessman."" Especially since it rained on the Car free day this didnt stop nor discourage anyone from participating in the event. The event turned out to be a huge success and reduced the amount of smog that day. In my perspective we are all come together as one to build our community together. It takes more thenone person to have such a huge impact on the world. The goal if to lessen the usage of car to have a positive effect on the environment. The influence of the Car free day is just one step closer to reaching that goal. This will is why programs are being creates to spread the news of Car free day.

After looking of the causes and effects of limiting car usage , it all comes down to having a big influence on the world. It takes one area such as Bogota, Columbia to have a huge impact. In our every day lives , our car is our main resource for transportation, but this should change. Not only are you capable of helping to have a postive effect on the environment but so am I. This just shows how if we are all willing to come together as a community, we are capable of creating a healthier environment. This is why the world should influence limiting car usage.",0,train_essays,,4
E04208981449,"As an 8th grader, I have been thinking a lot about graduating early from high school. Some people say it's a great idea, while others think it's a bad one. So, I decided to do some research to find out the pros and cons of graduating early.

One of the biggest pros of graduating early is that it can give you a head start on your college education. If you graduate early, you can start college a semester or even a year early, which can give you a big advantage over your peers. You can take more classes and get a jump-start on your degree, which can save you time and money in the long run. Plus, you can get used to the college routine and atmosphere, which can make the transition easier.

Another pro of graduating early is that it can give you more flexibility in your schedule. If you're done with high school early, you can take a gap year and travel, work, or volunteer. This can be a great way to gain real-world experience and figure out what you want to do with your life. You can also take a break from school and come back refreshed and ready to tackle college with renewed energy.

However, there are also some cons to graduating early. One of the biggest cons is that you may miss out on important elective courses. If you graduate early, you may not have the chance to take classes like AP or honors classes, which can be important for college admissions. You may also miss out on extracurricular activities and sports, which can be important for building your resume and making connections.

Another con of graduating early is that you may not have as much relaxation and vacation time. If you're done with high school early, you may have to start college early, which can be stressful. You may also have to work more to save up for college, which can be exhausting.

Finally, graduating early can also limit your options when it comes to pursuing different and new courses of study. If you're done with high school early, you may not have the chance to explore different subjects and find out what you're really interested in. You may also miss out on the opportunity to take classes that are only offered at your high school.

9DB8409B95F6,"Trust is a fundamental aspect of any relationship. It is the foundation upon which all successful relationships are built. When we trust someone, we open ourselves up to them and allow them to have a significant impact on our lives. However, it is important to remember that trust is not always reciprocated, and sometimes it is broken. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of trusting people and not changing for anyone, describe a scenario where I accepted a bad friendship with a person who was not a good influence, discuss how my trust was broken by someone who lied to me and how I lost a friend, explain the lesson I learned from the experience, and describe how someone can determine if a person is a good or bad influence.

Firstly, trust is essential because it allows us to form meaningful connections with others. When we trust someone, we feel comfortable sharing our thoughts, feelings, and vulnerabilities with them. This level of intimacy is not possible without trust. Additionally, trust can lead to a sense of security and stability in our relationships. When we trust someone, we feel confident that they will be there for us and support us through thick and thin.

However, it is important to remember that trust is not always reciprocated. Sometimes, people take advantage of our trust and use it to manipulate us or take advantage of us. This can be a difficult experience, but it is important to remember that it is not our fault. It is not our responsibility to change who we are or what we believe in order to please others. We must remain true to ourselves and our values, even when faced with adversity.

One scenario where I accepted a bad friendship with a person who was not a good influence was when I was in middle school. I had always been interested in fashion and beauty, and this person was a popular girl in school who seemed to have it all. She had a lot of friends, was always well-dressed, and seemed to have the perfect life. I was drawn to her because of her confidence and style, and I wanted to be her friend.

However, as time went on, I realized that this person was not the best influence on me. She was constantly gossiping, spreading rumors about others, and putting people down. She would also pressure me to do things that I was uncomfortable with, such as smoking and drinking. I tried to distance myself from her, but she would always",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,9

By limiting the use of car transportation, you are decreasing the harmful gases that automobiles release into the air. In passage two, it states that Paris initiated a temporary driving ban to clear the air of the global city, known as ""The smog"". Which is a great thing, because it motivates citizens to provide new ways to get around, such as walking or riding a bike; and it provides the area with freasher air to breath. France's actions caught the attention Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world.

Another significant reason why decreasing the use of cars is a great thing, is because it allows citizens to interact with each other; and to promote alternative transportations to travel around the city. In passage 3, it states that millions of columbians, in Bogota, Coulumbia partake in a car free day, which they hope will inspire others all around to do the same. The citizens of columbia used more effiecient ways to travel around the city such as, hiking, biking, or skating.

When they get a notification while driving they get distracted so now they're not focused on the road that puts them and other people in danger. Cell phones distract people from the road which may lead to an accident. Some people think they can multitask by driving and texting but that's not the case.

Multitasking is a hard thing for human beings. Even if you think you are multitasking the human brain can only process things one at a time. While people are texting and driving they are only focus on one thing so they can crash at any moment because they're not focused on the road. This puts everyone in danger. This is why states have put strict laws so that people wouldn't text while driving. This is why texting while driving is a leading cause for car accidents.

When it comes to car accidents, most of them occur because the driver was distracted.

Most likely they were using their phones. It was reported that, "" A distracted driver is a motorist that diverts his or her attention from the road, usually to talk on the cell phone, send a text message or eat food."" As it states most accidents are because of cell phone distraction this is why they made laws to try and stop texting while driving. Right now this is the leading cause for car accidents and we have to try and prevent it from continuing.

Texting and driving should not be permitted anywhere as it distracts the driver putting everyone in danger. All this causes people to die or get severely injured this is why people need to put their phones down for a while and focus on the road. This way we have a safer environment for everyone.

1F25E363B7CC,"Dear Principal ,

I strongly believe that cell phones should be permitted at school . We should be aloud to use them during lunch periods and other free times we have as long as they are off during the class period. This is why i believe cell phones should be allowed at school.

Lots of students need their cell phones during the school day. For example, there might be an emergency going on and the student needs to call a parent. If cell phones were not permitted they might not be able to contact their parent and they could be in a lot of trouble. Also by having a cell phone with them it would be much easier to step outside of the classroom to contact someone instead of having to use the office phone or the teachers phone. Cell phones are great to have at school because lots of students at school need them through out the school day and if they didn't have them it might make their day a lot more complicated and stressful. Although you may think that if phones are allowed at school, students might be texting during class, you can make sure that all phones are off during the class period and may be turned on when the class period is over. If a student is caught disobeying the rules their phone should be taken away and given back at the end of the day.

In conclusion, please read this carefully and put in lots of thought to my ideas that we should be aloud to have our cell phones at school as long as there are rules to go along with that policy. Are students here at school are very responsible and I know that if we have this rule it can make our day here at school better for everyone!",0,persuade_corpus,,8
41D5D90F8287,"Students all around the world have to cope with the anxiety and stress that comes with going to school. Part of the reason why is because of the environment the students have to be in. Some people simply cannot work well while sitting in a classroom for seven hours a day, five days a week. However, they are required to graduate and receive their diploma so they can get into a good college and have a good life. This does not mean they have to go to a building every day to learn and then come home and stress over their homework. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because it is a more relaxing environment for them, they will have more free time to get their work done, and it will increase the well-being of their mental health.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because they are able to work in a better environment. The environment of public school buildings can be too much for some students. They are required to sit in uncomfortable chairs in a cinder-block classroom listening to lectures that can sometimes go too fast, and on top of that, they have to balance 7 classes of homework every night which eats away large amounts of their day. While it may be better for students to receive in-person instruction so they can learn the material better, it is not worth the workload they have to deal with, and if they need help, there are virtual teachers who can help or they have the ability to ask someone for help at home. If they are able to work from home, they can be in a soothing and comforting setting and clear their mind because they are home, which can increase brain productivity which will make them have better grades. Another example of attending in-person classes being a bad environment is the social stress that comes with being in high school. Having to balance both a social life and an academic life can be too much for one person, which is why it would be better to take out the socialÂ aspectÂ of the equation and focus on having an academic career.

Another reason why attending classes at home would benefit students is because they would have much more time to actually get their work done and raise their GPA. Attending school in person for seven hours straight and then going home and only having 4 hours to complete all the homework given to them is not enough time for students to decompress when they come finish their day. On top of that, many teenagers have part-time jobs so that is another 6-7 hours not spent of getting schoolwork done. If students were able to take classes at home, they would space out and manage their time so it works best for their schedule, which is overall the smartest choice a student can make.

One final reasons why students should take classes at home is because it will increase their overall well-being and mental health. Aside from trying to keep up with academics, going to high school also comes with the stress of having a good social life. Teenagers all around the world are constantly trying to fit in with their peers and worry about their social life, which a lot of times affects their schoolwork because they prioritize their social life over their academic life. Students today are more worried about having a lot of followers on social media rather than raising their GPA and taking Advanced Placement classes. Depression and suicide rates are so high in teenagers because of how they get treated by their peers at high school. One of the main causes of suicide in teens is because they are being bullied, and bullying would decrease drastically if they took their classes from home. This is how it would better their mental health and overall well-being.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because they are able to work in a much more comfortable environment, they can have more free time to get all of their work done, and it will positively increase their mental health and overall well-being.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
AF4A2E8AD2A5,"Some people argue that working in a group has more benefits then working working alone. Some people also argue that working alone has more benefits then working in a group. Working alone is more beneficial the working in a group because, if one person in the group does not come to school the group will be short a person, if a member in the group does not care about the project, and not everyone is going to agree with each others ideas and opinions.

If a member in the group does not come to school the group will fall behind and not turn the work on time. if a person in the group is sick with a virus they would have to miss school and miss work on the project and that would hold back the rest of the group from turning in the project on time. When being put with someone who does not come to school often will cause stress on the rest of the group and also a delay. When working alone the worry of a group member not coming to school is not a thing because its alone.

When someone in the group does not care about the work the group will be held back because then more work would have to be done by the others. When being put with someone who does not care is hard because only the rest of the group is doing the work and putting in effort. Working in a group would also not be fun because you have someone who is not doing anything. When the group is working the one who does not care would be sleeping or on their phone. When working alone there is none of this to worry about because it is a independent assignment.

When working in a group not everyone is going to agree with each other on the same ideas. If one person says they do not like that idea, the group would have to take time and all agree on something as a group. Agreeing on something would take up to one or two classes and that would waste a lot of time and put the project behind. When working alone there is not agreeing on anything, it is whatever that person chooses.

Working in a group it would be more fun but when working alone more work can be done. Being pared with friends is nice but the amount of work able to get done when alone is a lot more. In a group there is more communication, sometimes that communication can hold someone back a negatively impact their grade.",0,original_moth,"Task:

D948703E8026,"The city council's adoption of a 10 p.m. weekday and midnight weekend curfew for teenagers is a controversial issue that has been debated for years. While some argue that it will improve safety and reduce crime, others believe that it will stifle personal freedom and harm social development. In this essay, I will explore the long-term effects of this curfew and discuss both the positives and negatives.

On the positive side, the curfew will likely reduce the number of incidents of teenage crime and violence. Teenagers who are out late at night are more likely to engage in risky behavior, such as drug use, vandalism, and assault. By forcing them to be home by a certain time, the curfew will reduce the opportunities for these behaviors to occur. Additionally, the curfew may help to reduce the number of teenagers who are involved in accidents or injured while driving at night.

However, there are also many negative effects to consider. The curfew will limit the amount of free time that teenagers have to pursue their interests and hobbies. Many teenagers enjoy staying up late to read, watch movies, or play video games, and the curfew will prevent them from doing so. This could lead to feelings of frustration and resentment towards the city council and the community as a whole.

Furthermore, the curfew may stifle social development and prevent teenagers from building important relationships with their peers. Teenagers who are forced to spend all of their free time at home may miss out on opportunities to socialize and form meaningful connections with others. This could lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which could have negative effects on mental health and well-being.

In conclusion, the city council's adoption of a 10 p.m. weekday and midnight weekend curfew for teenagers is a complex issue with both positive and negative effects. While the curfew may reduce crime and improve safety, it may also limit personal freedom and harm social development. Ultimately, it is up to the community to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of this curfew and make an informed decision about whether it is the best course of action.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,6
098FA5D40CF6,"Some schools are considering allowing students to take classes from home by way of: online classes, and video conferences. Seventy percent of people agree that home-schooling is one of the best methods for students that dont learn as well in the classroom. Reasons could be that they are fearful of not understanding something and try to go with the flow along with everyone else, or they're just not comfortable.

Majority of students enjoy their homes more than anything and dont really care for the school buildings. Working from home would allow the students to have the freedom to work in the comfortable place they call home. Instead of having to wake up bright and early every day just to sit in classrooms and try to learn in a day what you can learn in an hour, it can be done within at least thirty minutes. It also gives students the chance to really focus on whatever is giving them a hard time and practice that more often than possible at school.

Being schooled from home lowers the window of opportunity for distractions by seventy-five percent. Being in the classroom with friends tempts students to talk to them, causing a distraction in the workplace. Eliminating that chance is vital to students who want to get to where they want to go. It could include the small things like going to the restroom when needed instead of asking ten million times a day, or even grabbing a snack during a lesson to keep students as comfortable as possible.

Online schooling could really give students a much more comfortable place to learn and boost their success rate. Sitting in the classroom chairs for six hours a day, and listening to teachers lecture all day can really be stressful and tiring. Especially to the students that don't really learn the best that way. Some students may not feel comfortable about asking a teacher about certain things in front of other students in fear of being called names,or being classified as, ""Slow learning."" This way could possibly give students to ask teachers about things they don't understand and fully grasp it.

Sometimes more one on one time with an educator is what students need and can be very beneficial to their learning abilities. Learning from home would definitelyÂ lower the student drop-out rate because they would really learn ways to balance their school work with their other activities,a skill that can get them far in life. If more school districts gave students the chance to work from home, more of them would take the opportunity and actually apply themselves more because of them being able to work in the comfort of their home.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
C2B40B0DCC34,"The modern day schools offers online schooling to students but, does the students really benefit from it? Classroom learning is better than online schooling because of how it benefits the students in the long run. Classroom learning gives the chance to have activities and give better opportunities for the student and even the teachers. Some students learn better by online conferencing and learning through the computer but other students might not feel as comfortable doing that.

Classroom learning can give the student better opportunities to students various different ways. The first way is how a students can socialize with his or her peers throughout the day. Many kids today lack the socialÂ skills needed to make friends or even in the long run of getting a job. Further adding on to that subject the average kid talks to his friends at leastÂ once a day but if the students takes online schooling it takes the whole socializingÂ aspect away. Another way is participating for athletics. Some Students in this modern day love sports, as a student myself I love to play sports in my free time. If your student takes online schooling you take that chance to be on one of the sports teams that your school provides. Finally the last reason is that the teacher can help the student, the teachers and the students are the most important people in schooling today. If a student takes online schooling and is having a problem with a subject, what happens if the student can't get in touchÂ with the teacher? The student is stuck without help on the subject the need. Another scenario is what if the student is having internet problems and can not get his lesson or his work that he needs? The student is once again stuck in the same situation of not being able to complete the schoolwork he needs.

In modern day society the world is very technological, we use at leastÂ one electronic device a day like a phone, computer, an etc. Students might not be able to afford the technologyÂ needed for his or her class, and that causes tension in the modern day of learning. Some students can't learn on the computer, or they don't even like it. Online schooling creates so many factors of problems on the education of the student. Certain students are able to have online learning but in most cases classroom learning is the best option for the student. Online schooling would effect the schooling drastically.

Online schooling causes ripples in schooling today. It creates more work and stress for the teacher because she has to conference and help student by student instead of teaching the class is a whole. It doesnt benefit the teacher or even the students, it just causes a factor of problems in the long run. Again certain students might learn better online and prefer it but not every student should have that. Online schooling could effect teacher's jobs at schools and effect the learning of the students. Once again the benefits of classroom learning outÂ weighs the benefits of online schooling.

Finally my standpoint of online schooling is that its doesn't have the benefits of class learning. Some students prefer to have online but it causes problems in the long run. Have the option to talk to your friends and talk to the teacher in persons are the tip of the ice berg in my standpoint. It truly depends on the students and how she or he feels about the way they learn. But classroom learning gives the student more opportunities than online learning and gives the opportunity to learn social skills needed in the adult world.Â  Â Â    Â Â    Â  Â  Â  Â    Â  Â  Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
ED0A8E614649," Technology has revolutionized the way students and teachers can access education. With online classes, students can now take classes from anywhere in the world, and teachers can reach a wider audience. However, there are advantages and disadvantages to taking classes online. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of online classes and how they can benefit students.

One of the main advantages of online classes is the flexibility they offer. Students can take classes at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is particularly beneficial for students who work part-time or full-time jobs while attending school or college. They can take classes during their free time, which can help them balance their work and educational commitments.

Another advantage of online classes is the access to a wider range of courses. Many colleges and universities offer online classes that may not be available on-campus. This means that students can take classes that are not offered in their local area or that they are interested in but cannot find locally.

Lastly, online classes can be more convenient for students. They can take classes from the comfort of their own home, which can help them save time and money on transportation, housing, and other expenses associated with attending classes on-campus. Additionally, online classes can be more convenient for students who have families or other commitments that make it difficult to attend classes on-campus.

In conclusion, online classes offer several advantages that can benefit students. They provide flexibility, access to a wider range of courses, and convenience. While there are disadvantages to taking classes online, the benefits can outweigh the challenges for many students. As technology continues to evolve, online classes will likely become an even more important part of education in the future.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

3F47D1C0FA1C,"We've all had those mornings where you slept through your alarm and woke up to your mom or dad yelling, ""Wake up! School starts in 10 minutes!"", and you having to throw on the nearest outfit, skip brushing you hair and teeth, and even miss out on eating a good breakfast to make it there on time only to realize you left your homework at home. If this scenario occurs more often than not, I offer a simple solution: online school. Most schools offer online classes so you can enjoy the luxury of a stress free, organized environment of your own home, whilst receiving the same education as your peers.

Going back to our morning routine. Taking online classes would flip that scenario backwards. You would be able to wake up on your own devices, shower, eat a healthy breakfast and not have to worry about getting anywhere on time. You set your own schedule when taking online classes and the only deadlines you have are for your classwork and tests. There's no need to rush when you're already where you need to be.

Working at home can also be very stress relieving. You can set the temperature to whatever you'd like, get snacks when your hungry, take breaks when you need to, and wear (or not wear) anything you want. Attending a physical school takes all those things from you with rules that only benefit the teacher and staff, but when you're at home, you make the rules.

Organization is another aspect that is greatly benefited from taking online school. By not having to bring work back an forth from two different locations, it eliminates that dreadful possibility of losing the work you put so much effort into. With everything being on your computer, it makes organization easier than ever. All your work is kept in all their corresponding subject folders, making everything easy to find, work on, and turn in.

One thing you might be concerned about is the lack of social events such as athletics and other extracurricularÂ activities that would might be involved in at a school. Being part of a team and making that team your family over the years is something I know people value with sports and other group activities, and not having access to that would be upsetting. However, I can assure you that with minimal research and effort you can find a multitude of activities that fit your likes and needs in your community or even a high level club program run by a private organization.

Stress, organization, and time management are all very important things when we are attending school. Your youth and teenage years are always stressful and hectic; and going to a physical school just adds on to that. To be able to make your own schedule, wake up when you feel well rested, and have everything organized in a senseable, maintainable manner, are just some of the main benefits one would obtain from enrolling in an online education.

71F52F69777F,"Everyone thinks that the ""Face"" on Mars was actually created by aliens, but that sounds crazy. Sorry everyone, but actually, it's just a landform. You may not believe it right now. It's true though. I'm here to tell you how it is not created by aliens.

In 1976, NASA took a ""MGS image"" and people who saw it, thought it was a face. People also thought it was created by aliens, but it wasn't. A few days after NASA had the picture, they let everyone see it and according to the article, the caption noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The Face was just a rock that was not formed by aliens.

People may think it is formed by aliens because, how else would it get there? Or, why would it just randomly look like that? Although the picture does show a human-like face in the structure, they took another picture in 1998 showing that it is just a landform. Also, in the article, a man named Garvin states that he has saw similar landforms that look like the Face around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" If there are similar things on Earth, it has to be a landform.

I'm going to make this clear that it is just a landform. In 1998, an MGS flew onto Mars again and took another picture. According to the article, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" In 2001, NASA also sent another MGS to Mars, still no alien monument, just a landform. Even when the Face was a popular trend, defenders of the NASA budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars, but there wasn't.

I hope this information helped people understand that it is just a landform. I didn't mean to crush anyone's hopes and dreams, but it's just proof, and science! It's crazy, isn't it? That something that seems so real, just isn't. It's still nice to know that Mars has some kind of a development with nature. That's my argument for the debate on the Face on Mars.                           ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
darragh_claude_v7_459,"Dear Principal, 

I am writing to you regarding the cell phone policy options under consideration. Upon reviewing the two choices, I believe Policy 1 is the better option that should be adopted by our school. There are several reasons why allowing phones during lunch and free periods is preferable to a complete ban.

Firstly, having access to phones during non-academic times allows students to stay connected with friends and family outside of school in a safe manner. Many students rely on their phones to communicate with parents about after-school activities and plans. An outright ban could potentially cause issues if students are unable to coordinate rides or updates to schedules. Allowing supervised use at lunch and between classes addresses this concern. 

Secondly, a limited use policy such as Policy 1 is more reasonable and will be easier for students, teachers and administration to enforce. Teenagers today have almost universal access and attachment to technology. A total prohibition may lead to an increase in phones being hidden and used surreptitiously, making the policy nearly impossible to enforce with full compliance from all parties. Policy 1 sets clear limits that are more aligned with the reality of students' digital lives today and allows the school to keep phones out of the classroom as intended.

Finally, permitting phones during non-academic times recognizes that most students will responsibly use technology for permitted purposes like listening to music or socializing if given structured guidelines. An outright ban risks punishing all students and treating them the same, regardless of their ability to adhere to limits. Policy 1 empowers student choice and responsibility by allowing appropriate phone use as a privilege, not a right. 

In conclusion, adopting Policy 1 is the wisest path forward that reasonably balances student needs, academic priorities and practical enforceability. I hope you will approve this balanced approach to phone use at our school. Please let me know if you need any other considerations from the student perspective as you make your decision.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

[Your name]",1,darragh_claude_v7,"Your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. She is considering two possible policies:
- Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

63268F421EE1,"I personally think that there should be an electoral college vote. Not only does it keep the popularity vote out of check, but it also holds a good amount of personality behind the fact that it carries over 100 years of tradition, divide that by 4 years per term of president, thats over 10 presidents that have won their electoral college votes. If they used the popularity vote? We would go insane. If the people realize whatÂ  they are talking about, we could go billions of dollars out of our debt hole were in..

Our spending habits these presidents we have had over the past years have lead us into doing? Im surprised were all still alive honestly. Different candidates have different ways of planning their lives in office, their daily commutes, their daily functions, what laws they are going to put into place next, the next time that they will make a public apperence, those kind of things. But when theyre talking about taking electoral college out of play because its ""outdated"" personally I would say throw them a box of loony toon cereal.

I dont believe in throwing out something our founding fathers came up with. Expecially now that we have so many of our constetutional rights going out of play and being laid to rest for the manyÂ  years that they helped serve us justice and made us actually realize our country went to war to fight for our freedom, thats basically taking away our freedom to have who we think is best in office.

89BED1950DFE,"Some people take advice from more than one person, I will be telling you why that is. Some people have trouble deciding over items, so the person could look for multiple people to help them decide, one person could say one thing and another person could say a different thing, the person would have to ask more people and base it off of the reasons he was given. Reasons why people should ask more than one person is that they can have more than one answer or opinion, and it can help them decide through multiple ideas.

People should ask for multiple opinions because they can acquire more than one answer. Having more than one answer can help you decide. Generic_Name could not decide on which pack of bananas to choose at the store so she asked two workers which they preferred best. Another reason why you should have more than one answer is so you would have more to work with. Generic_Name asked people which lawn chair was the best to purchase, he obtained multiple answers and used them to choose a lawn chair.

Many people should ask for multiple opinions because it can help them decide through the ideas they obtain. A reason for that is that it can make for a better decision. Generic_Name acquired multiple ideas from asking people so she can make a better decision on what she is going to purchase. Having multiple ideas to decide with can help you have more to work with. Generic_Name was able to think easier with having more opinions on where he should eat at.

Another reason you should have multiple ideas is so it wont stress the person out trying to choose it. Generic_Name did not stress over buying a new house because he asked his parents and friends to help him decide.

These are the reasons you should have more than opinions when making a decision. It can help you with more than one answer to help you decide and to have more to work with. It can also help with multiple ideas, help you make better decisions, help you decide by having more to work with, and helping not to stress over the decision.

While i can tell what you are saying, I think that to have a B average to participate in sports is very unreasonable. As you may know an B in a very nice grade to achieve and maintain, but also it may be that most of the student body that participates in sport related activity's cannot achieve such goals. It may be just out of their reach or along ways away, but no matter, they should have the right to play sports just as they have the right to pass with a D average.

Most student who may be having troubles with there school work may not understand or be able to comprehend the material given to them. This is not completely their fault. The teachers should give a better explanation of the material to the students who are troubled.

Don't you think that the students with a C average are already stressed out enough? With all of the extra work they would have to do just to get the B that they need to participate in sports, they would most likely have the sleep they need deprived from them as they would need more time after the strenuous amount of homework given to study for up coming test and quiz's that they need to ace.

So I hope that you consider what I have said, as to prevent all the depravity in the already stressed out teen life.

15D68BD247CD,"Dear principle,

I am writing you this letter because of your new policy you are considering on passing for sports. I know many people on school sports team's, i myself do not participate in school sports. I participate in out of school sports. But many friend's of mine are on the school's volleyball team, basketball, cheer leading, and football team's. I know they enjoy their sport very well, but if you make the change from having a C average to participate, to a B average most kid's will not be able to enjoy their sport anymore. All lot of us kid's have C average's.

But i believe if you make take away sports from C average people you may not have any school team's anymore. I don't think that your grade average should be able to take you off the team. I know that your probably thinking i shouldn't have a say in this since i don't play school sports. But i do play out of school sports like volleyball, tennis, bowling, and some other sports just to name a few.

I don't want to see my friend's being kicked of the team just because they had a bad day, boomed a quiz and it brought down there overall grade in the class. I can tell you one thing that i know many people who play sports that, that is all they live, breathe, and eat is sports. They practice everyday even when there not at a team practice they practice with friends and family to achieve there goal and be good in the sport that they love.

So i guess what i am trying to say is don't change the sports grade policy, after all a C average is still passing.

Thank you for taking the time to read this argument letter about the new policy that i hope you don't which to. Thanks again Mrs. Principal.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
0F2E9FA7DAF4,"""All students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity this school year. Whether it's a sport, like football or cheer leading, Or a club such as theater, you must choose at least one activity to be in."" Said Principal Generic_Name as he spoke loudly into the school's mic. A handful of students in Mrs. Generic_Name's 7th grade homeroom groaned and complained from hearing the announcement made over the intercom.

One reason I believe that students should be able to decide if they want to do extracurricular activities is because, students might already be doing another sport or club outside of school. For example, he or she could be on a travel basketball team or cooking club and have practice everyday after school, so they do not have enough time to participate in any extracurricular activities that the school is forcing them to do. ""I already play on a travel basketball team and have practice everyday for 2 hours, i'm way too busy for this!"" Generic_Name shouted grumpily.

Another very important reason students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because, he or she might be involved with a religion that requires them to go to church frequently. For instance, one student might have bible study on Wednesday nights. Another student might have to go to church every Sunday and won't have time to join a club. ""I have to go to church a lot because of my religion,"" said Generic_Name adding on to Generic_Name's comment.

The next reason is, some students might not have have enough money to buy or rent the sports gear they need. He or she might not be able to afford the proper items you need for a club or sport. They might be embarrassed because they cannot afford what the rest of the students can. The other students might make fun of them for not having what they have. Generic_Name walked up quietly to the teacher's desk to tell Mrs. Generic_Name something. ""I don't think I can afford to buy what the other students can buy."" Whispered Generic_Name. ""Do you need to go to the counselors office?"" Mrs. Generic_Name asked. ""Sure"" Said Generic_Name. Mrs. Generic_Name quickly wrote him a pass and sent Generic_Name on his way.

Finally, another reason I disagree with this decision is because some students might be trying to focus on their grades or keep them up. Whether it's so they can get good final results on he or she's report card, or wanting to impress and make their parents happy, getting good grades is a great thing to focus on. ""Mrs. Generic_Name, I want to be able to focus on my grades so they can be high."" Generic_Name said in his unusual, nerdy voice. ""To be honest, i'm just not interested in doing any activities."" Generic_Name complained. ""I might as well send all of you down to the counselors office at this point!"" Mrs. Generic_Name said as she was laughing. She quickly scribbled all 4 kids a pass just as she did for Generic_Name.

""Good Morning students, welcome back to another day of school."" Principal Generic_Name exclaimed into the mic. ""Yesterday as you know, I told all of you that you had to do at least on extracurricular activity, but since we got so many complaints about it, I have decided to give you a choice. You can choose whether or no you want to do an extracurricular activity."" Principal Generic_Name said. All of the students who complained jumped out of their seats and shouted with joy. ""Phew!"" They all sighed. ""So much stress is lifted off of our shoulders!"" The kids said excitedly.   Â  Â    Â  Â    Â  Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

If they can make special roads; like how General Motors created a concept car that could run on track charged with an electrical cable, there should be an on/off switch for this kind of driving as well as things that are restricted to human drivers only.

CD1D7EC5810C," The debate over whether it is more beneficial to work alone or in a group has been ongoing for years. While some people believe that working alone allows them to learn how to accomplish tasks on their own and take responsibility for their work, others argue that working in a group can lead to more ideas and a shorter time to complete tasks.

One argument for working alone is that it allows individuals to learn how to accomplish tasks on their own. By working alone, individuals can learn how to manage their time, prioritize tasks, and take responsibility for their work. This can be especially beneficial for individuals who are just starting out in their careers or who are looking to develop specific skills.

For example, Thomas Edison famously invented the light bulb without asking for help. He failed many times before finally succeeding, but he was able to learn from his failures and eventually come up with a successful design. Similarly, Leonardo da Vinci spent years working on the Mona Lisa, but he was able to complete the painting on his own and without any outside help.

However, working in a group can also have its benefits. When working in a group, individuals can learn from each other and bounce ideas off of each other. This can lead to more creative solutions and a faster completion time. Additionally, working in a group can provide a sense of community and support, which can be especially beneficial for individuals who are new to a particular field or who are struggling with a particular task.

For example, the Wright brothers were able to successfully design and build the world's first airplane by working together. They were able to combine their ideas and expertise to create a successful design. Similarly, when working on a group project at school, students can learn from each other and work together to complete the task within the given time frame.

In conclusion, both working alone and in a group have their benefits. Working alone can allow individuals to learn how to manage their time and take responsibility for their work, while working in a group can provide a sense of community and support and lead to more creative solutions. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the individual and the specific task at hand.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

Having a positive attitude is good for you and others. Many people are depressed and being around someone with a positive attitude makes them feel better and more confident.

And Having a good attitude is like having a good vibe and people love being around those type of people.

You will feel better with yourself if you are in a good mood. Being positive helps with your mood and they way you see life. If your having a hard time at work or any other ativities such as school, sports or even at home. You could gain motivation on doing those things by having a positive attitude.

A positive attitude helps a lot on your daily basic. Let's said you and you wife or husband argue. All you would need to do is think positive like about good memories or moments together. I'm pretty sure if y'all love each other the argument won't really affect anyone. Another example if you have a good attitude people at work would love working with you, People at school would love doing group work with you. No one likes to work with a negative person so why ruin the party when you can share positively to other. Many good things can come out of having a positive attitude.

However, A lot of people would believe that not having a positive attitude is the key to success, They are wrong because a lot of things could happen when you are a negative person. Such as being depressed, losing motivation to do almost anything, making bad decisions, not like being with others, and not liking things you use to do. All this reason could be because of a bad attitude.

Knowledge and care will prove the true provisions seeing any crew safe to harbor. For now my range lies here, though restlessness for distant shores already takes root. When next the sea beckons, may it find me rightly prepared in both abilities and heart, so others may follow in pursuit of wisdom with clear conscience.

Adventure calls all willing to face life's surprises with courage. Yet prudence guides the hand ensuring each new dawn finds stronger the bonds between traveling fellows. This I will strive for whether sailing or staying; that however far horizons may stretch, the wellbeing of community remains fast anchored. This learning will prove passport to journeys beyond measure, wherever tides may roam they transport most - understanding.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,8
73F61C6675AB,"Dear STUDENT_NAME,

Cell phones in school can create a distraction to students, but there is a way to prevent this. You should allow the students to bring phones to school, and only use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones aren't used during class hours. This is a good idea because there will be no complaints from students. If the phones are going to be seen during class, then they will be taken away, and given back after they go to detention and you speak to their parents. If this happens a second time, then their phone will be taken away and given back after their two week suspension. If you take phones away for the whole day you will get complaints, people wont like the school, and the rules. The goal of a principle is probably to get the children to have good jobs, and be good at it. Taking away cell phones wont help people be better people. In the future, the students will have their phones so earthier way they will go on it.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
falcon_180b_v1_899,"Talking to only one person when asking for advice might limit the information we receive. Seeking multiple opinions can help us gain more knowledge and perspectives about the situation or decision we are making.

For example, if we want to decide which school to go to, asking one person might provide us with limited information about the pros and cons of that particular school. However, if we ask two or more people, we can gather more information about different schools, and then use that information to compare and make a better decision.

Additionally, when we seek multiple opinions, we can hear different points of view on the same issue, which can help us to see it from different angles and weigh our options. For instance, if we are thinking of choosing a profession, one person may give us advice based on job prospects, while another may focus on job satisfaction, and yet another may highlight the importance of passion. By taking in all of these perspectives, we can make an informed decision based on all these factors.

Furthermore, when we ask multiple people, we can also learn from their experiences or mistakes. We can use their advice to avoid repeating similar mistakes or to gain insight into what has worked for others in the past.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help us make better choices. We can gather more information, see problems from different perspectives, learn from their experience or mistakes and use it all to make a well-informed decision.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

71F27422C5FC,"My friend, Generic_Name, is a very good student, he will not go to bed unless he finishes his homework. However, because the school has changed the system from five-day school week to four-day school week, he had to do more works than usual. He cannot sleep for a few days, he did not done all his works, and his grades tend to be bad. His parent decided to move him to another school. Changing from five-day school week to four-day school week has lots of disadvantages, mainly these three reasons: students do not have time to do more works, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises, and students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend.

To start with, students do not have time to do more works. let say that if we have an extra day to review all works that we done to prepare for the test on the next day, it would done well than when we just have more few minutes. For example: before the school change the schedule, I have a whole day to review my works to do the test, now I have to rush off my feet to review my works and that make me completely exhausted. Whenever the test would start on Monday, the students will have three-day weekend to do so, that is a completely waste of time.

To continue, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises. For example: My friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, they are good students, but because their homework is too much, they could not done all homework, they had to stop all the club activities to catch up their classes, their grades went bad, so their parents decided to move them to other school to help them study easier.

Some people believe that the school has four-day school week is better because they can have more time to learn and relax, they are wrong because having four-day school week make their time rush and their have to run to catch up the schedule.

And the last, students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend. For example: Generic_Name, a student from my class, he usually absents from school, since the school change the schedule, he started to go to school more often, but he did not study, he went around and talked what he did in the last three-day weekend, his grade was bad, but he did not care.

In conclusion, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week to conserve energy and resources, but the school does not have to because school is where people come and learn new world, to explore more what are we capable and able to do, we are not wasting the resources, so why we have to adopt four-day school week? Please write a letter to the local government of the city to change the schedule of our school. We are not using resources to waste, we are using resources to make a key to open the ""Success Gate"" leads to the bright future for our generation and the next America's generations.",0,original_moth,"Task: Write a persuasive letter to the local government of the city explaining why the school should not adopt a four-day work week, and the disadvantages of changing the system from a five-day to four-day school week.

E98F49492C8B,"Dear Principle,

I think that your fist policy is the best because if kids don't bring their phones to school then well they are not be able to call for help during a emergency like if the power went out or if the teacher is gone and there is a break in or if some staff member needs medial treatment and the power is out or if school gets out and a friend ask if you can come over after school. If you chooses the other on people are still going to bring their phones to school anyway so why not let them have it at school just have rules for them not consequences.

Maybe if you let them more people will listen and not get in as much trouble. If people start to listen then well people won't get suspended as much. Now if you choose the second policy then people will not listen and bring there phones to school and you would just be suspending kids who just brought their phone to school. You would have a lot more suspicions or detentions.

If the first policy is chosen then you wouldn't have to keep nagging kids to put away their cell phones or stay all night and wait for parents to come pick up their kids cell phone.

If you pick the first policy the kids will be much happier and the parents happier they don't have to go pick up their kids phone. So please pick policy one. If you pick policy one then the kids will most likely like their principle and not hate her.

57B68E9AEF5E,"To start off, the electoral college is a system thats been around for ever but is getting outdated. I think that some people might want a different system while others prefer the same or dont care. For all we know,Bob Dole could be right about abolishing the electoral college. Or maybe it needs a new way of carrying the votes. Me, I think we should get a new system as well, but heres why.

Time has nothing to do with this way of voting, nothing at all. But maybe we should see some changes in the way we elect a president. 60% of people would prefer that a direct election be held. Others are probably lazy or cant make it if one was held, and thats why they prefer the system were using now. But problems are starting to surface with this, already outdated system.

The very first problem already is the fact that they vote for the slate of electors and not to vote for just the president. Then the fact that you vote for 1 out of 34 democratic electors. If that one that you chose won the statewise election they would get the plethora of votes that were earned. All this locomotion instead of just voting for the people that you want to lead the whole country. If we were to vote for just the president and vice president of the state and whomever else we vote for, less problems would be seen.

More factors are that the state legislatures are basically responsible for choosing the electors. This is a very unfair factor because they choose people who oppose a candidate. If that happens, the popular votes dont transfer to that specific candidate. Also sometimes the electors refuse to vote. This system is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system that occurs.

The electoral college may have been around for a long time, but is getting old. The systems it uses are irrational. Its methods are outdated and bias. There is not much reason for it. We need a new system.        Â     ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
CFCB2643FCDE,"I believe that ""Driverless Cars"" are the next big thing to this world. Millions of people use cars today and have a chance of injury or worse. If a car could drive itself or be more alert of things around it, the problem of crashing wouldn't be there anymore. The beginning of driverless cars is already here so why be against something that has already made the world a safer place. As it says in paragraph seven that they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves without any human touch.

The reason I am not against driverless cars is that a person close to me was saved from a car crash with a automatic brake system. If that person was to have moved alittle more without the brake system they wouldnt be here today. Another reason is if a car could drive itself there would be more time to get stuff done on the way to your destination. If your a busy worker or a kid with homework due, then during that time you could get things done.

On the other end of the argument, we haven't come that far to make a driverless car. Sometimes machines mess up and cause problems and that could happen to this. There should be a button or something like that to switch a driverless car back to a normal car. We just dont have enough technology to do a driverless car and to make one now would be dangerous.

But in the future these cars could make things alot better for the world. Car crashes wouldnt happen and the pollution from cars would be alot less because of how much gas they take. They will make the world cleaner and get you to your destination faster. In my life time I hope to see a driverless car and get to be in one. People that are not aloud to drive like the elderly or teens without a license could go anywhere without any danger.

The idea of a driverless car is just amazing and I know im not the only one that would love to see one. In the future normal cars should be tossed and recycled to be made into new driverless cars. I would feel a lot safer being behind a car that knows everything then being behind my two hands.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
4E078101C9DD,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning. Should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? I believe these summer projects should be student-designedÂ and not teachers. How would the students enjoy their summer and knowing that they got projects that is due before school starts again. If we call it summer break then the students shouldn't get any summer projects thats gonna ruin the break for them. Let them enjoy their summer break. I understand where they teachers are coming from and trying to assign the students these summer projects and making sure they are ready for their upcoming classes.

I choose for it to be student-designed, because the students already have 10 months of school that they do projects and assignments that stresses them out already. If a student wants to continueÂ learning during summer then he can do summer school or online classes that'll help him continue his learning and staying on task. Students shouldn't get summer projects assigned to them during their break. For; example, how would they enjoy their summer break with their families, if they stressing about finishingÂ the summer projects instead of relaxing their minds and spending time with family.

Summer projects are beneficial for students. At the same time it all depends on what classes you are taking next year. If you want to challenge yourself and take hard classes then be prepared to get summer projects to get you ready for your classes. School work and projects already causes enough stress for the students in general during school year, but getting summer projects doubles it up. Summer projects will take the fun away from summer and it wont be the same for the students. Students won't have as much time as they want to do what they want in summer, they would be stressing about something that they shouldn't be. They wouldn't get the point of what summer break is actually for.

I do understand why teachers believe that summer projects would help students continue learning. Summer projects does help students stay on task and busy and prepare them for their upcoming classes. Summer projects are beneficial but students don't understand that. The students been in school for so long that at this point they just want summer break to come. Summer is time where the students can relax their minds and be stress free for little. You also gotta understand that some students don't have the time for it. For; example, there are students that play summer sports, there are students that work in summer to provide money for them selfÂ or help their families out. How would they do that knowing they got summer projects due and stress about not having enough time to do it.

In conclusion

I believe that summer projects should be student-designed and not teachers. It should depend on what the student want for himself not what the teacher wants. If the students wants to to stay on task and continue their learning in summer break then they can sign up for online classes or ask for summer projects to do. Not all students have the time to do summer projects. Students won't have any free time to enjoy their summer or family vacation. Let the students enjoy their summer break without a stress and relax their minds.Â Â    Â  Â  Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
D104A552BB7A,"Venus is a very interesting planet because it has many features like the Earth, but it is very dangerous to go to. Many are interested to see whats on it and wonder if it's a risk we should take to visit Venus.

Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is because it's the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys moutains an craters. Futhermore venus can sometime be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

Venus has many risks because Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. We can't get any rock,gas, or anything else, from a distance. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The conditions are far more exxtreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.

Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because of the most forms of photography and videography ineffective. Scientists seeking to conduct a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.

Despite all the risks for visiting Venus it'll be one heck of an accomplishment for being able to understand Venus and explore the planet Venus. Venus has many pros to visit for all the information for the future and knowing what can we do if it's so similar to the earth or maybe there is living organisms.",0,persuade_corpus,,8

But technolocial advancements are encouraging the further study of Venus and speeding up the process.

By teaching us that Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" and that it is relatively the closest planet to ours in the solar system, the author sees that ""Stiving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because of human curiosity...Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8). Meaning that the author supports the idea that studying Venus because the risk taken should be seen as a challenge needing to be conquered.

In Paragraph 7 the author states that ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus...electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions""(7). Thus demonstrating that the further studying of Venus is inevitable due to advancements that could decrease the possible risks of pursuing the sudy of Venus and eliminate the dangers.

In conclusion, the author supports the claim that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents because the knowledge to be gained is greater than or equal to the risks taken because the author sees it as a challenge rather than a risk, needing to be overcame. In additon, further technological advancements make studying Venus inevitable and is eliminating the problematic dangers that studying Venus presents.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
falcon_180b_v1_761,"The advent of social media has brought about a revolutionary change in the way we communicate and share information. With the click of a button, we can now connect with people from all around the world, share our thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and even build communities based on shared interests. However, this increased connectivity has also led to an exponential rise in the amount of personal information that is being shared online. This raises some serious concerns about privacy and security, which is why I strongly believe that there is a pressing need for stronger privacy protections on social media platforms.

Firstly, it is important to understand that when we share personal information on social media, we are essentially giving away control over who can access and use that information. Social media companies collect vast amounts of user data, which they then use for targeted advertising and other purposes. While some may argue that this is a fair exchange for the convenience and connectivity that these platforms offer, the reality is that many users are not fully aware of the extent to which their data is being collected and used. This lack of transparency is a major concern, as it makes it difficult for users to make informed decisions about what information they should or should not share online.

Secondly, the potential consequences of having one's personal information fall into the wrong hands are simply too great to ignore. Identity theft, cyberbullying, and online harassment are just a few examples of the types of harm that can be inflicted on individuals when their personal information is misused. In addition, there is always the risk that sensitive information could be leaked or hacked, potentially causing irreparable damage to an individual's reputation or personal life.

Finally, it is worth considering the impact that social media has on our mental health and well-being. Studies have shown that excessive use of social media can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression, particularly among young people. By providing stronger privacy protections, social media companies can help to create a safer and more positive online environment, where users feel empowered to share their thoughts and experiences without fear of judgement or retribution.

In conclusion, the need for stronger privacy protections on social media is more pressing than ever before. As we continue to rely on these platforms for communication and connection, it is essential that we take steps to safeguard our personal information and protect ourselves from harm. By working together, social media companies, policymakers, and individual users can help to create a safer and more secure online space for everyone",1,falcon_180b_v1,"With the rise of social media, there has been an increase in the amount of personal information shared online.

5B66541ADDCD,"Hello everyone I am Luke the Seagoing Cowboy. Today. I think it will be a great opportunity for you too by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. And here let me tell you why.

I started with a help of my friend because I had no choice. He introduced me after the world war II where people still live in the ruins and are starving. It was a good thing for me back then because I had no hope. And that is how it started.

When i joined the program it was hard definaty it a job after all my main purpose was to go of to the seas to another country and help poeple in needs. Through that I was able to go to alot of places, but moving wasent a easy job. I had time when I broke my ribs and could not even work for our crew and that is not all the tides in the oceans are strong very strong and if you were the night watcher too bad. I turned 18 when i was in way to Greece. I was able to be darte d for military service and they said to countine my military service. I also admit but it was a great oppertunity for me. There is also a fun side. When all the cattles were gone our crew was able to stay and play games like vollyball tabletennis,boardgames and lot more it is definatly worth it do ing hard work for all that. You could also tour the citys I visited the Acropolis,the Gondola ride in Venice,excavaded castle in Crete,Panama Canal an the way to China. So now lets go to the actuall reasons why you should join the program:

1. You can tour big places while you are there. That is one of the big reasons I joined the program 2. You can really be aware of waht is going on. I saw th ruins and it was really bad horrible all houses colasped...

3. You can help people in need and are starving for food even though they did not do any thing wrong. I felt really pitty for them beacase the war has not started because of them and they are starvng well for no reason.

I really think that you guys should join the program,ofcourse there are though times, but seeing people get satisfied by my work and visting places for free it is definatly worth at least trying out for this program. This program changed my life it might change yours too.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Generic_Name shrugged his shoulders and slouched to his room."" Oh Generic_Name I dont want Generic_Name to be excluded this year just likeÂ last year!"" Generic_Name's mother cried."" We've got to give him time, he might feel pressured if we talk to him about it too soon."" Generic_Name's dad calmly said. Generic_Name's parents waited for him to make new friends or to join a club, but every single afternoon he walks into his room, then eats dinner and he doesn't say a word. That next Thursday Generic_Name came home and slouched into his room like always."" I'm tired of this,"" Generic_Name'sÂ mom said under her breath. She walked into Generic_Name'sÂ room and screamed,"" Generic_Name I am tired of this, you can't hide away just because you are deaf. Your hearing aids are supposed to allow you to hear and talk to people, but you don't. You don't even talk to me."" Generic_Name'sÂ dad walked in."" Generic_Name tell your son that he needs to make friends or at least join a club!"" Generic_Name looked at his mom in shock. Students should join a club because, it can help relieve stress from school, clubs can help you meet new people, and it can give you a hobby to do at home.

First, students get stressed easily when a big test is coming up, or if they have a lot of homework and can't do it all. Stress can make you feel unhappy which can build up anxiety. When I was in sixth grade I was not in any clubs, and during tests I would panic and forget the answers. I decided to go to the councilor for help and the councilor gave me some good tips on how to keep calm during a test. Having a club to go to can give you something to look forward to during the school day and make you feel less anxious about school work. When I was in seventh grade I joined the yearbook and FAC'S clubs. I didn't feel stressed during a test and my school work seemed easier than the year before.

Also, clubs are a great way to meet new people and make new friends. Somebody could like the same thing as you and you never knew. When I was a seventh grader I joined the yearbook club and on the first day

Generic_Name told us to get into groups of two or more and go to take photo's of the other clubs around, but I didn't know anyone. I was walking down the hallway with a boy, and to my surprise he put his hand out and said,"" My name is Generic_Name, I am in eighth grade."" I took his hand and said,"" My name is Generic_Name, I am in seventh grade."" Clubs can help you make that first step to say hello. In eighth grade I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club, I started talking to people that I had never talked to before. I found that these people that I have never talked to have something in common with me. I started to talk to these people I met around the school too.

Third, sometimes when you join a club that club becomes a hobby and you start to do it at home. In my seventh grade year I joined the FAC'S club. In the FAC'S club we would bake and cook food, then I started to bake cookies and brownies more often at home and I also got my brother into it too. Know even though I am not in the FAC'S club I still love to bake. Clubs can give you an opportunity to try something new, and most of the time if it is something that you like you start to do it at home. In my eighth grade year I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club. I shared it with my brother, and know we invite his friends to come play a campaign with us almost every weekend.

Generic_Name stood up and walked toward his mom, then opened his arms up to give his mom a hug. "" I am sorry mom,"" he said,"" I will try to make friends."" The next day Generic_Name came home and strolled down the hallway to his room. He came back out and walked over to his mom."" Hey mom,"" Generic_Name said. "" What is it Generic_Name do you need help with your homework?"" "" Well actually mom, I took a flier from the tennis club, I was wondering if you would sign it?"" Generic_Name smirked. His moms face lite up and jumped in the air. She grabbed a pen and neatly signed the formÂ like she was about to win the lottery. A few weeks later Generic_Name's mom was sitting on the bleachers cheering for Generic_Name who is working hard on the court. Generic_Name took the last hit and swung his racket as hard as he could. The ball hit the ground and the crowd on the bleachers jumped in the air. "" Nice one Generic_Name, you learn so fast!"" Generic_Name's friend exclaimed. "" Thanks.""

0F7FEA47FA3E,"Many schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning although they're not in school. These projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. There are many reasons on why it should be the students choice and not the teachers.

Many examples can help explain why summer projects should be student designed. For example, projects require a lotÂ of work and time. Student's time, especially the summer. Students believe summer is their time to get away and enjoy themselves without having to worry about grades or failing a class. Teachers assign books or projects that they believe are whats best for students. That's why many students never actually do their summer reading or any summer assignments. The projects be boring and long. If teachers assign a book to read over the summer, students should be able to pick their own book to read or research, after all it's their time and freedom on the line.

If students were able to choose their own topic or own projects, they're more likely to do them. Mainly because they're doing something they want to do. A book or project they chose to research or read about. Its in their interest. When something is interesting for a student they're more likely to keep up with it. Who wants to waste their free time doing something they don't want to do or that doesn't interest them? A lot of kids never open or touch a summer project, let alone complete one. The summer is meant for kids to enjoy themselves, live their life a little without any worries, the one time they can actually enjoy themselves rather than two weeks off for a break and jumping right back into school and real life problems. It's where they can actually enjoy being a kid, staying out all night, being with friends constantly, or family whom they never see during school. These summer projects can prevent a lot of that, especially when parents be hard on students to complete a assignment they're not interested in. It's extremely difficult to try to get in the correct head space and force yourself to do something you don't want to.

Although it's always the possibility that students may not do the work even if they choose their assignment, schools would get more participation than before. If schools don't at least try, how would they know? Even if it's not every student, as long as more participate and try. Some turn out is better than none at all. Even with all the freedom and option to choose their assignment, its always that handful who just don't care enough to complete a summer assignme

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed. It's their time, effort and work going into it so they should have the opportunity to choose their own projects. There are many more reasons on why this should be allowed.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
E70DD00622DB,"From my personal experience back in middle school, I had to use technology for many different reasons. One of the reasons were for research purposes. I was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. So far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. Technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. I believe that technology has made a positive effect on people's lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient.

One reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. For example, people who are disabled or unable to travel out of their houses are able to go online and research for books and look for a site to teach them what they need to learn. The availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. Many schools started providing laptops and iPad's to students who are unable to connect online. Schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work.

Technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information.

Furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. For example, eBay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. This has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. Online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores. For example, many custom equipment's and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. Not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world.

Lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. For example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. Technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. Another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. For example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it.

Many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and I disagree with that. I believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. Technology is not only important to the civilians who are either students or adults who are working in the industry, but it is also important for the military who are using these tools to provide protection to our country and keep our people safe.

D5826C01FBF8,"Kids should be kids and not be forced to do an extracurricular activity. In my opinion kids should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity. Because most kids have homework after school and if they are forced to do an extracurricular activity they have to stay up all night doing homework, therefore they are tired the next day. Plus some kids might not be interested in the extracurricular activityÃÂÃÂ´s their school offers so kids are told to do something they are not interested in which can lower their self esteem. Some kids are the last stop of their bus and dont have time to do an extracurricular activity and get their homework done so they have late work or are always tired at school which can make their grades drop from AÃÂÃÂ´s and BÃÂÃÂ´s to DÃÂÃÂ´s and FÃÂÃÂ´s.

Kids should be able to chose if they want to do an extracurricular activity or not. Because the families of the students at your school might not want school to be hard for their kid plus some times tradition can get in the way as well. If a student is already stressed out from normal classes they may get to stressed in school leading to them taking others lives or claiming their own life or other bad bad things which is a bad look for your school. Making you and your teachers lose trust and even money. These students and this parents are the only thing standing between teachers and principles from getting fired or losing money.

We come to school almost every day to learn at school and do work at school not to waste time or to do work at home or an extracurricularÂ activity but to become the future of this state, country, and world. We are not slaves we dont come or chose to do stuff like an extracurricularÂ activity because we know we are better stronger and smarter than what some teachers principles and any one else that have a job at a school think I think we dont need it. We are the future and I think more schools need to treat us like we are. I think students should partly have a chose of what they want to learn or have done to the school. Some kids dont siting around at school all day they want to explore and learn first handed but by forcing kids to do an extracurricularÂ activity can take time away from doing that after school. Kids will less likely remember notes or worksheets they did in school and will most likely remember something real they seen or felt.

Some students want to have time at home to do sports or play games or talk to family but an extracurricularÂ activity can take time away from doing that. So in conclusion I do not think we need to be forced to do an extracurricularÂ activity. Because its not fair if we have to but cant on dont want to do it. We dont need to learn more in school we need to learn more out side of school. I think that an extracurricularÂ activity is some thing the student should divide if they want to do it or not.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
39AF0292F9B3,"Schools are places where kids end up spending the majority of their childhood in. Most kids end up disliking school for one reason or another, while others might love school. To have the ability to know how a child is feeling and map their patters can become useful in more ways than one. The use of reading a students emotions is valuable in many ways like helping with possible depression, enhancing the material, and creating a better enviroment.

School can be a stressful time for many students and also a time of growth. Especially in high school and even middle school, the childs body is going through puberty. This chemical change in the body can lead to mood swings and other issues especially when school stress is added on top. This technology is capable of indicating ""...the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(paragraph 7). With the aid of this technology the school can help students before they develope mental illnesses like depression that often go unseen due to hiding true emotion.

Also, in many schools students usually find the learning material to be sub par or boring in many cases. However with the aid of this technology ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (paragraph 6). If a teacher was able to pin point when exactly a lesson becomes boring it would majorly help with being able to reconstruct it as well. For difficult classes being able to know when the students are lost would help significantly in increasing the understanding of the material as teachers will be able to know exactly what the students dont understand, and thus be able to help them achieve better grades.

Being able to understand students emotions in a learning enviroment can also help with improving the school overall. SInce the technology would be able to understand the basic emotions like ""...happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" (paragraph 3), this can give a school tons of feedback on how to improve. For example, with negative emotions, a school would be able to improve its cafeteria food quality from knowing what foods are highly unpopular, and as a result save food from wasting. Or during school events, even though the event might be a success knowing how each of the students felt about the event would help with improving it for next year. The addition of this technology would allow a school to be the best the possibly could.

The addition of this facial technology can be quite revolutionary in a school setting. As students often dont share their true feelings, issues can be confronted and the students mentality can be improved. Also a better, and positive learning enviroment can be created. The ability to remove student confusion and make learning interesting would go a long way in helping not only the students grow and move forward positivly, but also the school as a whole.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
DF944DD9C026,"Dear Principal:

The ability to have cell phones on school campus is not the best idea. Kids can cheat on tests without the teachers knowing. Sometimes teachers trust the students that they wont text in class, but kids can break that rule. Yes, sometimes it is nice to have your cell phone out for a calculator (if you are allowed to use one) or even to call your parents if there is a big emergency happening at the school, but kids ruin the advantage that they get for being able to have their cell phones out.

Since I a' m a student at a SCHOOL_NAME, i think it will be awesome to be able to have your phones out during break times. The only thing wrong with that is kids will have their cell phones on in classes and text when they are not supposed to. If i was sitting next to a student that texts non stop during class time, it would be very annoying. So not only is it rude for students to text while their teacher is speaking, but also can be disturbing to students around the person that's texts while they are trying to do class work.

If you can only have your phones out during break time and not during class session that wont be a hard problem for some student to listen to. Some students will listen to that rule and teachers can trust them; but there are still students out there that will text during times that they are not allowed to.

In conclusion, students should not be allowed to have their cell phones on school grounds. If they were allowed to have their phones, then they would text during classes which is rude to the teacher; and they also won't learn anything if they were texting.

80DFF2FC7C1F," I strongly disagree with the statement that technology has a negative impact on communication. In fact, I believe that technology has greatly enhanced our ability to connect with others and has facilitated communication in various ways.

Firstly, technology has made it easier for people to stay in touch with friends and family, regardless of where they are in the world. For example, video calls and messaging apps have made it possible to communicate with loved ones in real-time, even if you can't be physically present with them. This has allowed people to maintain relationships that might otherwise be lost due to distance or time zones.

Secondly, technology has made it easier for people to connect with others who share their interests and passions. Social media platforms, online forums, and gaming communities have created spaces where people can come together to discuss and engage in activities they enjoy. This has led to the formation of new friendships and relationships that might not have been possible otherwise.

Thirdly, technology has made it easier for people to access information and resources that can help them in their daily lives. For example, online shopping and delivery services have made it possible to purchase goods and services from the comfort of your own home, without having to physically go to a store. This has saved people time and effort, and has made it easier for them to get the things they need.

Fourthly, technology has made it easier for people to learn and grow, both personally and professionally. Online courses and educational resources have made it possible for people to learn new skills and gain knowledge, regardless of their location or time constraints. This has opened up new opportunities for people and has helped them to achieve their goals.

Finally, while it's true that technology can be addictive, it's also important to recognize the benefits it brings to our lives. By using technology in a responsible and balanced way, we can enhance our ability to communicate and connect with others, and can improve our overall quality of life.

In conclusion, while technology has its drawbacks, I believe that it has had a positive impact on communication and has greatly enhanced our ability to connect with others. By embracing the benefits of technology and using it responsibly, we can continue to build stronger, more meaningful relationships with those around us.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

77FAA33476CA,"Why does most people want multiple advice when they are seeking for advice? As human beings we all go through hard times in life because that is how life works. When we go through those hard times we want to ask for help from maybe a friend, family, or just anyone that is close to you and you know them very well. Seeking for advice does not only mean you are having trouble with something. Asking for advice can also mean asking someone if you are making the right choice. Something that we have to remember is that not evryone is not ok with asking people for their advice. There are many reasons why most people are afraid of asking their friends or family for advice is because they are scared they might judge them or laugh at them. Something else most people are afraid is their family or friends might think they are crazy or they are just making things up. For my final reason I think this reason is the really importent in my opinion because this is what a lot of time kids, teens, go through is people might think they are doing this for attention. Now by attention I don't mean something as so they could get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know what's right for your own kid and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what.

What I am writing about is something that I have been through in life. There were a lot of times in my life where a lot of my friends were going through really hard times in life and most of the pain they were going through was their families not caring or thinking that their kid is crazy and they just want attention. The truth is if you wanna help your friends or even family members you need to give them the right opinions that you have and help them find other people who can help them and give them their opinions. Something else that is really helpful when seeking multiple opinions is, it helps the person make a better choice. Again this might not be so easy for the person, but it opens more doors for them and it makes them feel like they do have a way out of their problems.

In 6th grade I had a really great friend she came from a different countrie and she was from Generic_City, and had no idea how to speak english. She did knew some words like how to say hi or say her name, but that was all she could speak. After a couple of mounths in school I noticed that she was having a very hard time in school because many people bullied her. Everyday when she came to class she was always sad or she was always in the office. I knew that my friend was going through something so I tried talking to her and helped her by giving my opinions of what she can do and what she should do in order to slove her problems. By giving her many opinions she was able to overcome her problems and she was always happy and she was starting to speak a little more english and it was like as if she was a whole new person.

This might not be easy for many people who has a close friend that is going through something and they don't want to talk about it because most of the time they are shy or they don't want people to know. Always keep in mind that just because that person does not want to tell you anything does not mean they are ok or they don't need help, always try to talk to them and tell them that you care and you want to help them. This can also build up the persons confidence and it helps them to open up more with their feelings and they can try to talk to their family members or their friends more often.

Now why is Seeking Multiple opinions really importent? Well I just told you there are many reasons why it's importent. It helps people to know they matter and there is a sloution to their problems no matter what they are going through. It opens more doors for them, and helps them know that they do matter and they should talk to people they can trust. Something that parents need to keep in mind is that when your kid asks for advice don't think they are crazy or they just want attention because that is not the point, they just want help with what they are going through.

724349D0EA4B,"""All of our development since World War II has been centered on a car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. To some or most a stament like this may seem outlandish or absurd. We use cars for daily life, to make it through this world, whether its to work, school, the store, it seems almost impossible to live without one. Vauban, Germany is an upscale community of suburban pioneers who have simply given up their vehicles. As many as 70 percent of Vauban's famalies do not own cars. Heidrun Walter, a resident and mother of two, says she is ""much happier this way"". So what it is that has caused many communites like Vauban to take the advantage of living without a car? Green House gases better known as smog, that is polluting our air that we breathe.

In some places like the beloved Paris, home of the Eiffel Tower, smog has gotten out of hand. Paris has even enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. After 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty seven had their cars impounded for their claimed reaction to the fine, the congestion was finally down 60 percent. Beijing, China, known for being the most polluted cities in the world the smog rivals. You might even see people wearing masks in Beijing for their own health and safety.

Bogota, Colombia has caught on and spread this idea to other countries as well. For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis allowed for a Day Without Cars. Not even rain or shine stopped Colombians from traveling accordingly. Instead of being pessimistic about traveling alternatively most Colombian see it as a good opprutunity to take away stress and lower smog. So, imagine a day without cars in the bustling city of our own, maybe like Detroit. Well it seems that President Obama is catching on.

Recent studies suggest a drop in Americans getting licenses', buying cars, and driving all together as years pass. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and is dropping from there steadily. Could it be that Americans love for cars is simply not what it used to be? Or is it that more alternate and practical ways of travel are now being provided and accepted widely? Either way if our country keeps up the good work sociologist believe it will have ""beneficical implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment"".

First of all, when you challenge yourself to do something you're not totally comfortable with, it helps you build confidence. Like, you might be good at math, but if you try to solve a super hard problem, you might feel like, ""Whoa, I actually did it!"" And that feeling is, like, the best feeling ever.

Another thing is that when you keep pushing yourself, you learn new skills and develop new abilities.

9938EA5EE964,"Everyone assumes that the best way of transportation is by a car. Teenagers dream of getting their license on their sixteenth birthday and maybe even getting a car. Most adults use cars to get to and from work, drive their kids around and do fun activites. But what people don't understand is that there are so many other alternatives that ultimately result in a happier and healthier planet. There are so many downfalls with driving and owning a car that many are now believeing that it is much more reasonable to just not own a car.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal, line 6). Having cars stress people out and people don't even realize this. There are so many responsiblities that come with driving. No one enjoys sitting in long traffic jams. It is annoying and quite bothersome. Everyone gets so frustrated, nevermind the amounts of accidents that lead to injury and death from it all.

In Colombia there is a day once a year in which cars can not go on the road or they are served with a fine. This effort is to try to bring stress levels down and stop air pollution. ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily and devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky, line 23). This idea promoted excersize and got people out and doing things in the community. The citizens clearly were not against this day or else they wouldn't have been acticve. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city"" (Selsky, line 28). This just goes to show what driving does. It isolates people. Without all the cars, one is more willing to spend time outside and interacting with other people and since people were out and about more and enjoying the community, the area has gotten more presentable and pleasureable to be in. ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Selsky, line 29). Officals and shop owners are making more of an effort because everyone is more active and caring.

In Paris, the officals made an effort to try and clean up the cities pollution rates. They assigned a day where even number licensed plates could not be on the road and a day for odd numbered plate cannot be on the road or else they will be fined. ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" (Duffer, 14). If anything, it goes to show that the amount of cars on the road is absurb. 60 percent is more than half, that's a lot of traffic. Paris primarily uses diesel, causeing a lot more pollution in this busy city. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"" (Duffer, line 17). Paris is a very touristy area and people go in hopes to see a beautiful city. This project went so well that officals planned to continue it. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" (Duffer, line 19). If officals planned to continue this idea, than it must be benifical in some way. If citizens just made an effort to not drive everywhere, than restrictions would not have to be mad. It's because of the amount of driving that is going on that officals have to get involved.

""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" (Rosenthal, line 37) Motor vehicals cause so much danger to Earth. The amount of pollution is so high and dengerous. It is much easier to prevent than everyone believes. One could simply take the bus, ride a bike, only drive to work and needed places, walk, and even car pool. There are an abundant amount of ways to prevent so much pollution and stress. It's all over the world that this is an issue; Paris, Colombia, the United States, and many other places. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. "" (Rosenthal, line 11). That is a lot. It isn't difficult to help prevent this.

In the long run, not driving would result in happier people anyways. Cars are so expensive that is would cause less aggravation and economic stress as well as the basic stress of just driving and being in traffic. Society could make the world so much cleaner and safer for the next generations. It starts now. Get a bike or a pair of walking shoes and start getting active in the community. Start making the changes now so it isn't forced by officals later. make the effort and show the next generations how life should be. This could lead to a much happier and healthier life style.

There are dangers along the way such as the extreme temperatures, the acidic atmosphere, and high pressure. But scientist are trying to make it possible for success of making equipment that will last through all of those hazords on Venus. Even with the problems along the way, scientist still work on ways to reach Venus beacuse it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago it most likely covered by oceans and was able to support life.

In conclusion, figuring out a way to reach and study Venus for a long time period is worth the risk of failure. We will learn from our mistakes and study the conditions of the planet more to make it possible to actaullly be able to study and retrieve results from the planet surface.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
37986AF08E7A,"Often when a person seeks help they will ask more than one person, when I have a issue I usually ask my parents, my brothers, a friend or one of my teachers. I find that by asking more than one person I can gain more knowledge on the subject, and by having more knowledge I can become better equipped for answering the question. This means that if you are to ask for help from more than one person you are likely to come to a better answer, the more people you ask, the better the answer.

If I asked the former President Barack Obama a question about doing the dishes and then I ask my mother the same question chances are I will get two different answers. To quote Daniel DeVito (commonly known as Danny DeVito) ""You gotta sift through the duds."" this quote teaches me that if you want the best answer then you must ask more then one person, and these people would preferably be from different backgrounds as asking people of similar lifestyles will warrant similar answers. An example of asking people in similar backgrounds a question would be asking two far conservatives if we should cut on non-renewable fuels, chances are they will say no, now asking this same question to two far liberals would likely warrant a yes. With this knowledge we can determine that asking similar people will get you similar answers, although this strategy seems effective if you ever intend to use it I would recommend not asking offensive questions as people often get angry when you ask to personal of questions. I also feel that I should mention that this strategy of mine can sometimes fail when asking people about history, simply because people like to change history, A recent example of this is about how some people are taking down statues from the Civil war era, which some people think is great and some people hate this. I personally understand the people who want to take the statues down I get where they're coming from but I agree with the people who don't like it, by taking down the statues you are effectively denying a part of our history, even if it is a awful part of our history.

By asking more then one person you are almost always going to find people of varying knowledge, and by getting people with higher knowledge you have a much lower chance of being misinformed or having to deal with bias. Now as you read that last sentence you probably thought yes of course being misinformed will happen less but bias would still be there yes? No, If the person you ask has more knowledge then why would they change there awnserÂ to fit some political quota that they have instead of just telling you the awnser, If what they know is right why would they tell you something that they know is not right on purpose. By asking lots of people you will be able to like Danny said ""Sift through the duds."" you will eventually find someone who lacks bias and who has enough knowledge on the subject to help you. Also once you find that special somebody who know about this subject they will probably know about similar subjects, a example of this would be my friend Generic_Name, Generic_Name knows a lotÂ about geography and history as well as some biblical history, so whenever I have a question about Geography, history, or a story in the bible I will just ask him about it. He is a trusted source that I have and by finding him I have basically found a book about history and geography that I can read anytime I need to read it, and something my Generic_Name book does that normal books don't is that he gains knowledge. The more I wait in betweenÂ asking question the more he will know about something.

A quick summary of the last two paragraphs would be ask multiple people to avoid bias and ask multiple people to find someone who is smart, in this paragraph I'm going to explain what you do with this knowledge once you have it. Its really simple, you make a decision, you being the key word, you have to make sure you are the one making the decision and not the people you asked and you have to be sure you know enough about the subject. Thats really it, be sure you know everything you need to know and be sure you make the decision, But what do you do after you make this decision you may ask well thats also simple. Help others. Other people will ask the same question as you and they will ask around as well, so if someone asks you a question related to what you learned earlier then you can actually help them, you can be that magic person that you were looking for when you were learning as well.

In the end asking more than one person is most certainly more beneficial then asking just one, and to find the best awnsers your going to want to avoid asking people of similar backgrounds the same question and your going to want to ask people who know the most about the subject. Once you have done this you are ready to help yourself and help others, and helping others is probably the best part of this system because it gives you the most gratification out of anything you could do with this knowledge.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
713B362568B4,"Don't you always go to others when seeking advice? The more people, the better right? Getting advice from multiple point of views weighs on making the right decision. Its better to seek multiple people for advice because there are different point of views, some are older and wiser, and if you don't use their advice you can still use it in the future to come.

Wouldn't two views be better the one? If you were to hears someone view on the situation and don't agree with it, wouldn't you like to hear the other side? When one gives you advice from their view and you don't agree with it, you can still hear others input on it. If you were to only hear out one person, would you think you would have the best advice? When asking for advice people naturally ask multiple people. They want to see others view point on the situation. if you want to have the best advice, you would ask people from different stand points.

Remember the old saying, ""The older the wiser."" That comes in handy when seeking advice. Since the elder have more experience with life they have a better stand point on things. Others might think that the elders don't know what they're talking about since they are from older times. Some think since they are form older times their advice is what matters the most. When getting advice you should at least ask a few elders to know where they stand. This way you will have point of views from the older older generation.

In addition, when getting stand points from others that would work in a situation. You can always go back on it for another situation.

Sometimes people give right advice but for the wrong purpose. While you may be getting this point of view from one person, you may keep it for another situation. Later on when you need another point of view. you can go back to what someone told you that would make sense for a particular situation. Getting different point of views may help in one situation, it could always assist you in another.

All in all, asking more people for their point of view will result in better advice. If one view doesn't work for you, you can always ask others. It is better to seek advice from multiple people because there are different point of views, some are elder and wiser, and if you don't use their advice you can still use it in the future. More point of views the better.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

Dear [Principalâs Name],

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the current school cell phone policy that is being reconsidered. After considering both policies, I strongly believe that we should go with Policy 1 - Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

There are several reasons why Policy 1 would be a better choice for our school. Firstly, with the advancement of technology, smartphones have become an essential tool in our daily lives. They allow us to stay connected with our families and friends, access important information, and use various educational apps and resources that could aid our learning processes. Therefore, allowing students to bring their phones to school would not only provide us with the convenience of staying connected, but it would also enhance our academic performance.

Secondly, many emergencies can happen at any time, and having a cell phone readily available could make all the difference in those situations. For example, if something happens during lunch or break periods, students will be able to contact their parents, guardians, or emergency services right away. This will ensure the safety and wellbeing of the students at all times, even outside regular class hours.

Finally, it's worth noting that the majority of schools and educational institutions have already implemented similar policies, and it has proven to be effective. These policies have allowed students to use their phones while adhering to certain limitations and guidelines, and it has worked quite well so far. I believe that our school should follow suit and implement Policy 1 as well.

In conclusion, I strongly advocate for the adoption of Policy 1, which allows students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class time. I sincerely hope that my opinion and suggestions will be taken into consideration while making the final decision.

Thank you for your time and attention.

First, I strongly think that NASA would tell us if there were aliens who created the Face because in paragraph 5, the author says, ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" NASA actually says their hoping there is an alien civilization on Mars and they shared pictures of the Face to the world so that shows they would be excited to tell us if our thoughts of extra terestrial life were real. Also, in paragraph

NASA puts under the description of the picture that it is just a huge rock fomation and the shadow in the picture just gives the illusion of a face.

NASA always keeps us posted on pictures and information, they tell the world through pictures and research what's going on in outside of Earth like the pictures from the Viking 1 in 1976, the Mars Global surveyor picture from 1998, and the 2001 picture from the latest MGS. If NASA did not want the world to know about these things they wouldnt tell us at all what's going on but they do because they want us to be interested.

In conclusion, I am clearly convinced that the Face is a natural landform because NASA woud inform us if there were alien affairs taking place on Mars.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

Teachers are more knowledgeable others who follow a certain rule setÂ to get students to graduate to the next level of knowledge. These teachers mainly know better than students and help students grow as people guiding them to a better life. Teachers know more than the students about life through their experiences, so the students should listen and do what their teachers tell them to do such as a project over summer break. The Summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers can correctly guide their students to be ready for their next level of education through their knowledge and experiences through college training for their own profession.

The Summer projects should be designed by teachers because they are correctly guiding them, so they are ready for the next level of education. Teachers are people who like to help others and put the students on the correct path, so they can lead a good life with knowledge. Teachers genuinely are also nice people who mean no harm to anyone because their career choice deals with helping students everyday, so they will not lead their students on bad paths. Instead, the teachers will make sure the students are prepared for most things that will come at them in life and even if the students don't like the Summer projects in the end the teachers were looking out for them. Due to the teachers kind nature of helping others they will keep their students on the right path through the Summer projects that allow the students to retain the information they learned in the year.

Teachers are trained and educated in college to bestow knowledge on students and normal people who don't have the type of knowledge they do. Throughout the school year the teachers are becoming more familiar with their students adapting to the best type of learning they can to educate their students. By the end of the year the teachers are more familiar with the student's learning style, so they can set them up with a project that will help them retain the knowledge to be prepared for next year. Through their experiences the teachers know what is best for the students they are teaching, so it is more within reason for the teachers to design the projects.

Some may say that the student designed projects would be better, but this is incorrect because students are known to be lazy during the Summer. The students would design a project that does not benefit them in their education because they want to be free and do whatever they want to do during the Summer. The teachers on the other hand would prepare them with good intellectual projects that help the students retain the knowledge. So, it is in everyone's best interest that the teachers design the projects to help the students.

Teachers are kind, valuable, and educated individuals who are here to help their students succeed in life and their school career. Through their knowledge and experiences in college teachers can correctly guide their students to be successful individuals that flourish in the world around them by retaining knowledge throughout their school years. Whether it seems like it or not in the student's eyes the Summer projects designed by teachers are there to help them succeed.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

I know that many students don't respect the school rules. They are using their phones during class instead of putting attention, or people steal their phones and etc,. and just wasting money buying one and another.

Its better to do not allow students to have phones at school, so they can put more attention to class. But what happen if its an emergency and a student didn't bring his phone because his school do not allow cell phones?

He has to call his parents so they can pick him up because they don't know at what time to pick him up because sometimes he has tutoring sometimes not, or maybe they are busy or in another close city. He can't enter to the school to call his parents because the school its already ended, for some reason, like here in my school that they do not allow students to go in after school ends. He can't call his aunt, uncle grandma even his parents, Why? Because he doesn't have a cell phone. What would happen to that student? So then, where is he going?",0,persuade_corpus,,2
D734914EA4D3,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. The passage states that NASA's Mars Global Survey spaceraft revealed the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Gobal Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eigteen long years after the Vikings missions ended.

In the passage, it says that on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform. There were no alien monument after all.

The pasage also states that not every one was satisfied. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien marking were hidden by haze. Therfore, researchers sent the spacecraft back to Cydonia, on a coudless day, and took more pictures of the Face. Malin's team captured extraordinary photos using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

7F539C089AFF,"With technology being used more in society, websites like Khan Academy and IXL are being used increasingly more than before. To adapt to these changes, schools have started to offer distance learning which allows students to take classes from the comfort of their homes. If students were to take distance learning courses, they will benefit and learn more effectively from these courses.

Firstly, the student will feel comfortable learning at home. To elaborate, the student taking the classes will be able to learn at their own pace and feel relaxed. For example, my precalcÂ class has a lot of topics to cover over the span of 9 months. In order to teach everything in the curriculumÂ in a class that lasts for 90 minutes, my teacher often spends a week to two weeks on a given topic, giving me, the student, little time to digest all the new information I received. If I were to take the same class but online class at home, I would be able to take my time to truly learn and understand each concept. The location of the class can also impact ones learning ability. For example, my World History 2 class had many students that took the class to be with their friends. Every other day, the group of friends that sat in the back of the class would always take over the teacher, resulting in me not being able to hear the lesson. To combat this, I would go home at the end of the day and watch a video explaining the lesson I was supposed to learn that day. At the end of the school year, I learned that it is beneficial to have a quiet place to study and what better place to study than at home.

Secondly, distance learning courses will help the student save money on class materials. For example, my English class required me to buy many items: two notebooks, a three-inch D-ring binder, a folder, black pens, and pencils. The cost of these items totaled a little more than $50. That was the price of the materials for just one of my seven classes. For a distance learning course, the most a student will spend, given they already own a computer, is $10 for paper and pencils to do work with. The student doesn't need to buy folders or binders for online classes because all of the documents will be online. The student can also revisit the documents at a later date for an online class, unlike the papers in a binder which can be lost or worn down over time. The money the student saves from not having to buy class materials can be put into paying for college.

Skeptics will say that distance learning courses deprive kids and teens of their needed interaction time with others. While the student may not be able to interact with their fellow companions during school hours, they will still have plenty of time after school. The role of a student is not to only enjoy their time with friends but to study for the future. Interactions with friends are important for students so they do not burn themselves out after studying for hours. I do not see my friends all day during school, but I always find time to relax, have conversations, and study with friends when school ends.

To summarize, while being comfortable for the student, distance learning courses offer all the same benefits as classes in schools. Given the opportunity, I would replace some of my classes with classes I can take online in the comfort of my home. The cost of the online classes can also help you in the future because you'll be saving money on class materials.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
42B977C6E77F,"I think Policy 1 would be a better policy then Policy 2. Policy 2 is a good policy to have at a school, but Policy 1 could be easier and safer. Both of the policies are a good thing to do for the school, but sometimes Policy 2 could be a lot harder to handle at a school.

Policy one would be a good policy because some kids do need phones at school. Some kids might walk home, and if there is an emergency they can be able to call whoever they need to call. In some cases, the child could be staying after school and the mother might have forgot and the mother would've been able to call. Policy 1 is exceptionally fair for kids too. kids can have their phones on during lunch but they have to turn it off during class. If kids turn their phones off during class there wont be any disruptions and everything will be okay. Another thing about Policy 1 is that if people respect the rules and don't text during class they wont get their phones taken away as much.

Policy 2 would be a good policy too, but not as good as Policy 1. If kids walk home and have an emergency, what are they supposed to do? kids should always have their cell phones with them just in case something bad like that happens. Also if there aren't to be phones at school then kids would try to sneak phones into school. If kids sneak phones into school a lot more kids would get in trouble. So it might be more stress on the school and the teacher to look out for phones instead of not paying attention to what they are teaching.

Like I said before, I do think both of the policies are good, but which ever one is better for student and their safety should be better for the school. Policy 1 would definitely be a better policy then Policy 2.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
E1898E71ABD6,"Title: The Power of Positivity: Unlocking Success in Life

Hey there!  As an 8th grader, I'm excited to dive into the topic of having a positive attitude and its impact on success in life. Researching this topic has shown me that having a positive outlook can lead to amazing things! ð

Let's start with some real-life examples. Oprah Winfrey, one of the most successful women in media, credits her positive attitude for her achievements. She believes that ""your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude."" Similarly, Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, says that ""a positive attitude can help you overcome any obstacle."" These examples show us that having a positive attitude can help us achieve our goals and reach new heights! ð

But how does having a positive attitude lead to success? Well, for starters, it helps us stay motivated and focused. When we have a positive outlook, we're more likely to take risks and push through challenges. It also helps us build stronger relationships with others, which can lead to new opportunities and growth. Plus, having a positive attitude can improve our mental and physical health, which is crucial for overall well-being. ð§ââï¸ðï¸ââï¸

Of course, keeping a positive attitude isn't always easy. There will be times when things don't go our way, and it's easy to get discouraged. But the key is to not let those setbacks define us. Instead, we need to learn from them and keep moving forward. One practical strategy is to practice gratitude. By focusing on the good things in our lives, we can shift our perspective and stay positive even in tough times. ð

Another strategy is to surround ourselves with positive people. When we're around people who support and encourage us, it's easier to maintain a positive attitude. And hey, who doesn't love a good motivational meme or quote? ð

So, is a positive attitude really the key to success in life? Well, I think it's definitely a factor. But it",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

5C29D02F268A,"Does the electoral college work? I don't think so, but some people may. I think the United States should not keep the Electoral College and should chose the president by popular vote. I think they should use popular vote for a many of reasons but I'm only going to explain a few of my reasons now.

My first reason is that, under the electoral college, voters do not vote for who they think should be president but for electors who vote for them. I dont think this is right because the electors they chose may not choose the person they wanted. I think it's unfair. Voters should vote for the person they think should be president.

My next reason is that the electoal votes may tie. If this happens, the election will be turned to the House of Represenitives, which would then vote on the president and the Senate would choose the vice-president. I think this is unfair because I also think they should let the public vote. I just don't agree with someone voting on some one to vote for you.

Finally, I think the electoral college is just simply unfair to voters. It's unfair because if candidates don't think they have a chance in a state they don;t spent much time there. They focus more on the places they have more of a chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all and voters in 25 of the largest markets in the United states didn't see a single campain ad.

The electoral college is unfair to the public. I think they should abolish the electoral college and vote on the president by popular vote. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much in reality. Just think about it, it would be a lot more fair to people if they did away with the electoral college and just used popular vote.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
F47F7676912A," I recently traveled to Generic_City to visit a friend I met online. During my visit, I was able to learn a lot about their culture and way of life. In this essay, I will argue that the use of technology has a positive impact on people's lives and human contact.

Technology has revolutionized the way we work and communicate. It has made it easier for people to find new jobs and connect with others. For example, if you're struggling to find a job, you can easily search for job openings online and apply for them from the comfort of your own home. If you're sick and can't go to work, you can communicate with your boss online and ask for a day off without the risk of getting fired. Technology has made it easier for people to work and communicate with others, even when they're not in the same physical location.

Another way that technology has positively impacted human contact is by allowing people to connect with others from different cultures. The internet has made it possible for people to meet and learn about different cultures from all over the world. This has helped to break down barriers and promote understanding between people from different backgrounds. It has also allowed people to learn from each other's mistakes and improve their own lives. For example, I learned how to fix a car much more easily by following my friend's method from Generic_City.

Finally, technology has helped to build confidence in people who may be nervous to communicate with others in person. For example, I have been shy and nervous to communicate with my family for six years, only talking to them through text messages. However, technology has allowed me to express my feelings, thoughts, and opinions to them, even if it's just through online messages. This has helped me to build a stronger relationship with my loved ones.

In conclusion, technology has had a positive impact on people's lives and human contact. It has made it easier for people to find new jobs, connect with others, and communicate with people they may be nervous to speak with in person. It has also helped to break down barriers and promote understanding between people from different cultures. I hope that people continue to embrace technology and its many benefits.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

To whom it may concern,

I believe that cellular devices or cell phones should be not allowed during free periods and lunch.

I Believe this because sometimes you need to contact family members, For example when there is an emergency going on with your family; someone is hospitalized, somebody has passed away , but that is not always the case.

I also see them as a distraction if being used for different reasons but, when these rules are made some people would like to be allowed to have them on campus, but the choices the district make are for our benefit in learning and succeeding in the real world.

In reality you cannot sit in your office and text the whole time you are there, so why start the bad habits now?

These devices are not bad but i believe it is not helping you to have them with either.

I understand some of the reasons other people would like to have the privilege to carry a cell phone but the way i see it most people do not follow the rules and take it out hiding it, and secretly texting or calling people.

Do not get me wrong i love having my cell phone but not being in contact with your family and friends for six hours will not kill anybody.

I know there will be many students now and to come that will disagree, but if you want to do well in school texting in class will not help you keep an ""A"" in any class.

Even having the temptation could be a distraction to your self and will not keep you focused.

Texting not only distracts you from the teacher some of the others around you can be distracted by it also.

So in conclusion I hope you see that this will not only benefit us but our grades because kids will have no choice but to pay attention.

It's possible to impress someone based on what we are, what we are doing, and what we want from them to do, because now days which everyone is fully educated and knows what is wrong or right, believes on their own. We can impress people towards our religion, towards our government party, and towards out country to visit.

We can impress people towards our religion by giving them the ideas of what is it about. How it will change up your future, how it will impact on your kids, how to treat with others, and also the idea of understanding someone better. Take them with us to the place where we practice our own religion, tell them the truth and advantages of it, and also show the religious cultures.

We could impress people towards our government parties to support us by voting us.

5153133CE3CA,"Dear Principal,

I think that all students should be required to perform community service. I think this for many reasons. Doing community service will be a great role model to younger ones. It will help influence them in the best ways yet. Participating in community service will also help students get into a great college in the future. Last but not least, helping the community is a great way to be involved. If you do not play a sport, or attend any after-school activities, community service is the way to go! Community service improves people's knowledge of their community and its people.

The thought of community service may not sound fun at all, but when you dig a little deeper, it is magnificent. First, what is the community? The community is everything and everyone around you. Even the people you do not associate with. Community service is volunteering to help out peers and others around you. Students should be required to participate in community service because it gives them a chance to learn how to help others out. This will help develop social and mental skills. The more they help out, the less there is to do around the community. Next thing you know, the park that used to be filthy and smelly is clean as a whistle! Four hands are always better than just two.

Helping out the community not only gives students a chance to learn about how to help out and socialize more, but also a chance for them to attend a remarkable college in the future. Colleges have many requirements; some may include involvement with the community, and others include school involvement in clubs. Having a record of community service will be perfect. With everyone pitching in to help out the community, everyone will become a better person.

Being a better person means being a role model for your peers and siblings around you. Helping out the community will give them the opportunity to see what it is like to help out. When they see that, they will become influenced and plan about participating in the future. Doing more for the community is always best. Whether it is picking up trash that people have littered in the local park, or it is cutting the grass at the public library. It is all apart of helping the community. Students should do this because it is a great experience. They will have new knowledge on ways to help out the community and ways to become a better person.

So why should they be required to do community service? Well, community service has many definitions, but it always leads up to one thing. Helping out the community. It is all apart of life. Being involved will get you to many levels. You'll become a better person and a respected volunteer. Do not only do it for respect, but also for honor and pride in yourself. You'll feel great. You will feel like a good Samaritan. You have lent a hand to your community and you deserve a great pat on the back. The local park is now cleaner than ever and your public library's grass is freshly cut and green like the crayon. Students becoming involved in the community will benefit everyone. It will cause a chain reaction to others in the community. People will say, ""Wow!"" ""What a great improvement!"" I'd like to join. They'll volunteer and so on so forth. All is well the ends well. Community service will lead to many levels of success.

Yours truly,

This could help students get better grades in class and it could also help the teacher know how the student is feeling so they can help them out if they are depressed or sad or even afraid .

This is a very vaulble system if a kid is afriad maybe somethig is going on at home to make them feel this way the teachers would be able to detect it and get the student the help it needs . In the article it says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored "" this means if the student is confused the teacher would know to maybe take the lesson a little slower and help the kid out or if multiple students look confused she could maybe just go over the lesson all over again.

This system works like a math problem in the text it says "" Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry "" You would know all the students feelings right away . Many kids do not ask questions or open up the saddest ones are always the quiet ones. Without this system the kids that have a fear of getting made fun of for rasing there hands to ask a question would never get help . Without this system the kids that are sad and depressed from who knows what would never get the help they need to over come that . Without this system kids that have the fear from maybe getting beat at home or getting bullied from the means kids on the play ground would never be healed , maybe the rate of school shootings would go down because the sad people would not be alone anymore .

E0538F7AB083,"First impressions are a powerful tool that can shape people's opinions and images of others and places. They are often based on superficial factors such as appearance, behavior, and environment. While first impressions can be misleading, they can also have a lasting impact on how people perceive and interact with others and places.

One of the most significant ways that first impressions can impact people is through the formation of opinions. People often form opinions about others based on their first impression, without taking the time to get to know them better. For example, a person may assume that someone who is dressed in a certain way is unintelligent or unprofessional. Similarly, a person may assume that a place is dirty or unsafe based on its appearance. These assumptions can be based on stereotypes and prejudices, and can lead to negative opinions that may not be accurate.

First impressions can also impact how people perceive and interact with places. For example, a person may be hesitant to visit a new city or neighborhood based on their first impression. They may be scared or intimidated by the unfamiliar environment, or they may assume that it is unsafe or unfriendly. This can lead to missed opportunities for exploration and cultural exchange.

Additionally, first impressions can impact how people remember and recall information about others and places. Research has shown that people tend to remember details about others and places that are associated with their first impression. For example, a person may remember the color of someone's clothing or the layout of a room based on their first impression. This can lead to biased and inaccurate memories that may not reflect the true nature of the person or place.

In conclusion, first impressions can have a significant impact on people's opinions and images of others and places. While they can be misleading, they can also be powerful tools for shaping how people perceive and interact with the world around them. It is important for individuals to be aware of their first impressions and to make an effort to overcome them, in order to form accurate and unbiased opinions.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,7
73DF8CA712BB," Elementary school students are a curious bunch. They are always eager to learn and explore new things, but they can also be mischievous and playful. They often enjoy going outside to play and engaging in physical activities like soccer and basketball. Unlike high school and middle school students, elementary school students do not have to wear uniforms and they are allowed to go to school in whatever they want.

One of the things that make elementary school unique is the fact that students have the same teacher every day. This allows them to build a strong relationship with their teacher and receive personalized attention. Elementary school students also have a set of specialized teachers for subjects like gym, music, and art. These teachers help students develop their skills and talents in these areas.

Lunchtime in elementary school is typically at 11:30 in the morning, and students are allowed to bring their own food in a bag. This bag usually contains items like apples, milk, juice, and sometimes even a sandwich. When they finish eating, students are expected to clean up and dispose of their trash properly.

Elementary school students also have access to a dictionary, which helps them learn new words and improve their vocabulary. In addition, there are often teachers available to help students who do not speak English as their first language. These teachers provide support and guidance to help students better understand the language and succeed in their studies.

While fights do happen in elementary school, they are relatively rare. When they do occur, they are usually resolved quickly by security personnel, who are able to separate the students and take them to the office. In contrast, fights in middle and high school can be much more extreme and difficult to control, as students may come to the fight to help their friends or because they are simply curious.

Most students argue about being kicked out on a team because of their grades, they think that grades aren't important in their lives but later on it might will, depends what you want to do in their life.

I personally agree with both but more I agree with doing well in school first. Like other parents say ""School comes first"" and its actually true sometime. Most people think school is just a place to be with your friends and joke around, but clearly you can joke around with your friends and also learn about what your going to do with your future life too. When students want to be a professional player in sports you need to have a scholarship for college if you want to be in football, baseball, basketball, and much more activities. College is something that everybody is proud of, like your own parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and much more family members.

91765789f9ec_04112023,"Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Pursuit

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus remains a worthy scientific endeavor, even in the face of significant dangers. In the article, several key pieces of evidence are presented to support this claim. 

First, the article describes how Venus provides an important comparison to Earth that can teach us about our own planet's formation and evolution. As Earth's closest planetary neighbor, Venus experienced many of the same early processes. However, without an insulating atmosphere or magnetic field, Venus transformed into an inhospitable world of intense heat and atmospheric pressure. Understanding these divergent paths can reveal new insights about Earth's climate and geologic history. 

Second, the author notes that robotic orbiters and landers have already yielded discoveries on Venus, such as clues about its volcanic activity and evidence that the planet may have possessed liquid water in the past. This indicates valuable scientific information can still be gleaned through further exploration, which helps justify facing the challenges. Advances in heat-resistant materials and small, nimble spacecraft designs also raise hopes that future missions can operate longer on the Venusian surface.

Finally, the article states that studying Venus may aid humanity's understanding of climate change processes and help assess Earth's long-term habitability. Venus serves as a sobering example of a greenhouse effect gone too far, so comparative planetology here could illuminate potential consequences of anthropogenic global warming. This clearly shows how Venus research addresses profoundly important issues that affect life on our own planet.

In conclusion, the author presents a compelling case through specific evidence that exploring Venus, while dangerous, remains worthwhile. Even in the face of immense heat and pressure, scientific insights gained about planetary climates, geologic evolution, and humanity's role in climate change more than justify further study of our closest planetary cousin. The article convincingly shows how Venus exploration can significantly advance scientific knowledge in ways that have implications for understanding Earth.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,6
513C9EA8B469,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

There are many pros and cons to requiring students to do community service. Some parents might not agree with it so you might want to talk to them about it first to give your opinion and to tell them a little more about what's going on. When you're talking to the parents, you should keep in mind that there are many pros and cons to requiring students to do community service.

The cons of requiring students to do community work is plentiful even if there are pros to counteract it. One of the cons is that even if the students are required to do it, it might not teach them anything or help anyone in the process. For example, they might try to help people but they don't want to do it and that shows and changes how everything works out. It might be helpful but they won't be taught responsibility because if they don't care about it, they don't want to learn anything about it, I know this from my own experience. Another con is that if they don't care about it, they more than likely won't do a good job on it. They're lacking of the ability to want to do it, and to enjoy it, and to actually try. If they don't want to, like most of them don't because if they wanted to they would have volunteered by now, they won't try and they won't care how it turns out. They don't care how it's affecting things or what the consequences might be. Another con is that most of them would have to give up some sports, or there homework time, or even their free time which I know most of them wouldn't be very happy about. Another con is parents, some parents are over-protective and don't want their children doing stuff like that, some parents don't want their kids to help other kids, and other parents might not want their children doing that work. So, there is a good amount of cons we would have to pay attention to and give it some thought.

Now we have the pros, which are also plentiful. One pro to having students being required to do community service is that it might teach them responsibility. If they do it and start to care about what they're doing to help people and their world (ecosystem) then it would get them to keep doing that and have other people try it. Plus if they do that, it teaches them more responsibility. For example, if they're picking up trash, they will realize all the work they have to do and that might change something in their brain and think that they shouldn't litter not only because it's bad for the environment but also because there is a certain amount of work involved to pick all of it up and keep it maintained. Another thing is that it can keep them active. If they're helping outside or working hard, it keeps them active. Obesity is a growing problem in our world and to keep kids active would be very helpful. For example, if they're outside picking up trash, they are walking around and not staying inside watching television or texting or playing video games. They're actually out and about and that not only would help our obesity problem but also help make our world green and bountiful. So, there are all the pros, and there's probably more that we can tell the parents to make them understand and maybe get them to agree with us to make our world a better place.

If you can't already tell, I am mutual on this, I think it's a good idea but I know there will be some problems. I think you should suggest it to the kids and see what they think. After all, we'll be taking over soon, it's our generation's time to shine. Let's make this world a place to remember, and to remember that we helped make it this way.

darragh_claude_v7_114,"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or asking for advice can be very helpful for a few key reasons:

Firstly, getting perspectives from different people allows you to gather more information to consider. Rather than relying on a single person's point of view or area of expertise, you can learn about a situation or problem from various angles. This exposes you to new factors, context, or solutions that one person alone may not have brought up. With more input and more complete data to contemplate, your decisionmaking will likely be more informed. 

Secondly, multiple viewpoints help balance or moderate any potential biases from a single source. No individual provides a perfectly objective takeâeveryone sees the world through the lens of their own experiences and prejudices. But bias from one advisor may be caught or counterbalanced by the opinions of others. They can point out holes in each other's logic or assumptions in a way the seeker themself may miss. This interplay of differing analyses leads to a more well-rounded analysis.

Lastly, seeking the counsel of more than one person allows for some consensus building or crossed validation. If most advisors point to the same conclusion or course of action, it suggests that choice has crossed an important threshold of prudence. Or if viewpoints are mixed, it flags that more factors need weighing. Either way, the seeker gains confidence by discerning which recommendations are broadly supported versus idiosyncratic to just one friend or family member. This consensus-validating function further strengthens the quality of the choice made.

In summary, there are sound reasons why running important decisions and requests for advice by multiple trusted individuals provides benefits. It exposes you to more complete information from various angles, counters individual biases, and helps determine which guidance has crossed a threshold of agreed soundness. More perspectives allows for wiser choices overall.",1,darragh_claude_v7,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

78B6F383CD30,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that completing high school earlier than the traditional age of 18 or 19 has numerous benefits. Not only does it provide opportunities for longer professional fields, but it also offers personal benefits such as being young and able to do more. In this essay, I will explore the advantages of completing high school early and why it is important for students to consider this option.

First and foremost, completing high school earlier can open up more professional opportunities. Many employers require a certain level of education before hiring, and completing high school early can help students meet these requirements. Additionally, some colleges and universities may offer early admission to students who have completed high school early, which can be a valuable asset when it comes to securing a spot in a competitive program.

Furthermore, completing high school early can also provide students with more time to pursue their interests and passions. High school can be a time of self-discovery and exploration, and by completing it early, students can have more time to pursue their hobbies and interests outside of the classroom. This can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful life, as students are able to pursue their passions and interests without feeling like they have to rush to meet the expectations of others.

In addition to the professional and personal benefits, completing high school early can also provide students with a sense of accomplishment and pride. Graduating high school early can be a significant achievement, and it can give students a sense of pride and accomplishment that they can carry with them throughout their lives. This can be especially important for students who may struggle with confidence or self-esteem issues, as completing high school early can provide a boost of confidence and self-esteem.

In conclusion, completing high school earlier than the traditional age of 18 or 19 has numerous benefits. It can open up more professional opportunities, provide students with more time to pursue their interests, and provide a sense of accomplishment and pride. As an eighth-grade student, I encourage all my peers to consider completing high school early and take advantage of all the benefits it has to offer.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,8

People from NASA have studied the Face since it first appeared in 1976. Since then, people have found claims and have had facts about the face proving it is just a natural landscape.

How did the face appear? There can be many reasons on how the face appeared on Mars. There could have been a storm on Mars that caused the ground to move upright and form the Face.

I would just like to tell you my opinion about community service. I think that you should require all students to perform community service. I think that it would be a good idea because there's always people in the world that would love to have help from other people and also just making the community nicer, and cleaner. I think most kids our age would rather go home and go to sleep, or just go home and watch television, but I think community service would really help the community a lot. You should have flyers all around the school telling kids to do community service. I bet if it seemed fun to do, than maybe they would like to. Most kids would probably do community service because there friends were doing it with them, that would also inspire kids to help out a lot if they were doing it with there friends. For some people, they already have to do community service for religion, and other things, but i still think you should make community service seem fun, so kids would actually want to be a part of it. You should also go around to all the teachers and tell the teachers to talk to their students about helping out. Sometimes, if you hear something from your favorite teacher you would like to do it. Well, at least that's what i have to say. I strongly believe that kids in our school would love to do community service, it would probably make them feel better about themselves because they either helped out someone, or helped out something. Just spending a half an hour on community service two or three times a week could make a big change for the environment. Also, when kids do community service, they could also be helping a little kid do better in school and that's a very kind thing to do. I just think telling you this would change things in our school and also change things in other peoples lives. If kids just did community service for about 2 hours every time they do, they could still go home after and do what they want or need to do. Well, I hope you take my advice. I believe that it would be an amazing thing to do for people around the world. That's all i have to say! Have a good day.

Word on the street is that you're considering banning cell phones from school campus. Now, you know as well as I do that the students are NOT happy about this at all. But I'm sure that that alone is not enough to convince you to let our cell phones be. That's why I'm writing to you about a policy that will allow cell phones on school ground, with a few limits, that will satisfy everyone.

First off, let me tell you why banning cell phones altogether is a bad idea. The students will be infuriated if that idea is put into motion, and will not only defy the rule, but a handful of students might actually do worse things, such as texting in class. You see, if you take away something from the students, they'll not only continue bringing that said something, they will, just to show that they don't care what the school administration does, do worse things. It's just the way students my age are, and I'm sure the younger grades are just the same way.

Plus, a lot of us actually need cell phones; many students are part of after-school programs or clubs, and they need to call their parents to gain permission to stay. In fact, a lot of students know when and when not to use their phones, and go along with it. It's only a handful of kids that actually disobey the rule of using cellular devices during class. The rest of us know the rules and why it exists and respect that. The rest of us want to learn, and do learn.

Now, I propose an alternative to the ""no phone"" policy you are considering: let us keep our phones, but don't let us use them in inappropriate times, like in class. Let us continue bringing cell phones to school on the condition that we don't use them unless needed. I'm sure that we will be mature about this and honor your decision if you choose this rule. I promise you that if there are students that can't be grateful for the merciful decision you made, those will be minimal and can be dealt easily with ninth hour or lunch detention.

In conclusion, I thank you for your time in reading this letter, and I'm sure you'll choose the better option. Remember, it's only a handful of kids that actually disobey the rule.

Thanks for reading,

112B1760D112,"In society, students can learn in many different environments and on many different platforms. People can learn in places such as school, while traveling, or at home. Although many claim that learning at home would help students grow as individuals because they have more freedom, students would not benefit from attending classes at home because there would be a lack of social experience, people's days would be less structured, and there would be more distractions.

To begin with, without school there is a strong lack of social encounters with others. School can be a fantastic way to make friendships, and learn at the same time. For example, a student could be struggling with the information to know for a test. With the help of another student, they could both learn the material and create a bond of friendship that could last a lifetime. However, if a student were to take online classes or video conferencing they would not step out of their comfort zones to meet other people. Without seeing others everyday, students would start to feel very lonely. Therefore, grades would drop because of the feeling of discouragement in their social lives. When students stay at home and do not see fellow students, their days would become long and tedious.

In addition, when students do not have school, their days are less structured. Without certain times for classes and school, there would be less focus for academics. An example of this is if a student were doing online school and decides to sleep in every morning. When they wake up later every weekday, they would have less time for schoolwork. This would cause laziness and stress due to the change in time and schedule. Also, with online school there is no school sponsored extracurricular activities to structure people's days. When students have activities to attend to after school, they are motivated to get their work done and are excited throughout the day. Without an activity, the students will believe they have more time and accidentally overlook the online schoolwork. When the pupils are busier, they are forced to block their time to get work done and are more focused.

Therefore, when learning at home students would be more distracted. While learning with video conferencing or online school, students have the options of TV, books, movies, and access to phones. These would distract from learning, and potentially cause cheating because no one is watching the students to make sure they are following an honor code. For example, a student could be learning online and takes a break because they are bored of working. A five minute break can turn into an hour and prevent learning with no teachers to watch over the student. However, if a student was learning at school they would have less of the distracting luxuries that we use at home. With proctors and teachers that want the best for the students, when using traditional methods for learning the pupils grow as individuals.

In conclusion, students would not benefit from learning at home because they will be less socially advanced in society, there would be less structure of the pupil's days, and the students would be distracted from their schoolwork. When online seminars and classes become a part of a child's day to day life, society will advance less over time. However, if people continue to send their children to schools, the new adults will have social skills, academic intelligence, and will be fantastic additions to the world.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
D26D8E38326A,"What do you do for fun? Sports,student council, or FFA are all examples of fun extracurricular activities to do at school. You should always try to do an extra activity. Therefore I agree that students should engage in extracurricular activities because it teaches then responsibility, time management, and it is fun and benifitail to do.

First off doing something other than just school can teach kids responsibility and time management.

Doing a sport for example. To do this you would be completing school work and the sports work,so you would have to be able to complete school work on time then focus on the sport you're playing. The way to do all of that is to manage your time with school and activities to do all of your school work and keep your grades up. Doing a extra activity requires responsabilliy and dedicating time.

Secondly extracurricular can be fun and healthy for kids. You never know what doors will open for you by taking a chance. By playing a sport could take you in to a profetinalÂ league. By joining school council could take you in to politics. You just never know what opportunities will come your way by doing something new. finding opportunities can be fun and uplifting. over all doing a extracurricular make you a more well rounded person.

In conclusion kids should do extracurricular activities because It teaches responsibility, time management and it is healthy and beneficial to young adults. Get out there and try something new.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Dear Principle,

Hello. I have recently heard the news that you are thinking about not allow students to participate in sports unless they have a B average. I think that it's a fair policy and I could not agree more with your thoughts.

I agree with you because many students that play sports as a middle school student will most likely not be a professional athlete, due to the very tough competition. Therefore, I believe that students should have at least a B average in school, so that later on, if they decide they are going to quit sports, they will still be able to succeed towards the academics side. If they only focus on sports from an early age, but later realize they're not good enough to be a professional, their futures of getting jobs will most likely to be difficult. No matter what job a person receives, they require some sort of basic skill in any of the subjects taught in school. So in case they don't succeed as a professional athlete, I think it's very important that students receive good grades in their education today.

If they start to earn C' s and other below-average grades starting from middle school, there is a better chance that they will most likely do the same in high school and college. I believe that whatever they major in college, there is always some sort of education involved. And what kind of good parent doesn't want their child to go to a college and become successful? Students should start to bring their grades up now, so they can start getting into the habit, that will help them throughout the rest of their lives.

Let's say that students who are involved in sports right now, do become professional athletes in their future. Even if they do, the basic skills of subjects like language arts and math are still needed. If as middle school students, they decide their careers as athletes, if they don't have the basic skills, I can guarantee they will have problems, even as an athlete. You will need your reading skills for situations like signing a contract, or math skills for when paying bills or counting up your money. Even as an athlete, you need the basic knowledge, so I think it's important that a student has these skills and properly learn them when they have the chance.

As you can see, education is very important, regardless of what activities a student is involved in. It doesn't matter where that student decides to go in their future, they will always need the basic education. I believe that students should raise their grades up before they regret it in their future, so I hope you do change the policy, for the better.

Sincerely,

By taking risks and failing, we can develop a better understanding of what works and what does not. Through analyzing our successes and failures, we can gain insights into the underlying skills necessary for achieving success. We must understand that failure is a necessary part of growth and success. Without failure, we cannot appreciate the small victories and measures of progress that occur on the path to success. 

On the other hand, failure can be devastating and cause people to give up. It can be discouraging and make the goal of success seem like an impossible task. But, it is important to remember that failure should not be all-encompassing and it should not define who you are. It is only a moment in time and a negative experience can eventually lead to positive results. 

Ultimately, embracing our failures and learning from them is essential in the pursuit of success. Even if failure leads you down a different path, it can still result in achieving your goals.

CA7EF1C7C3FE,"Graduating high school in three years instead of four can be a difficult decision to make for a student and their family. While some may view this decision as simply saving a year of schooling, there are a variety of factors to consider, including workload, cost, and potential future opportunities. 

First, the workload. Graduating high school in three years would likely require students to take more courses in a shorter amount of time. This would make it especially difficult for students who may struggle academically or those who are involved in competitive extracurriculars. Additionally, this could also impede the quality of a studentâs academic performance, considering the shorter time to complete each class. 

Second, the cost. Graduating in three years would likely require students to pay extra for the extra classes or accelerated courses. Families may also be burdened by the additional costs, such as textbooks, tuition and transportation fees. 

Finally, the opportunities. It is fair to critique that choosing the three-year option may limit a studentâs opportunities in the future. Although this decision has the potential to shave a year off of a high school career, college acceptance is generally dependent on credits completed and the courses taken. In addition, students who do not take the traditional four-year route may find it difficult to stand out among competitors who are more experienced in their fields.

D659F8B4298D,"The principle's decision of making all of the students participate in extracurricular activities can be a good decision and a bad desicion but it can go either way.Â A lot of people probably agree with this decision because doing activities that is not sitting in your room on your phone or on other electronics can be fun. Theese activities can be something that you have never done before or something that you actually enjoy doing. I know that some students would try to come up with an excuse to not do activities becasue they dont feel like it or they're lazy. On the other hand, other stuidents do really like doing actvities. For example, most kids do a sport, wheather it is soccer, basketball, lacrosse, or baseball, I have seen kids enjoy doing sports. There are also other activities like participating in a club like yearbook or serving on the student council. Even if you feel like nothing is for you there is always that one thing that you love doing or that one thing that keeps you company.

Like I said this decision can go either way. Doing extracurricular activities can also be a bad thing becasue it can take up time. A lot of students have a busy scheduele that they just dont have time for activities. For example, students could have other things they need to do at home like taking care of younger siblings, having a lot of homework to do, or preparing for a test. It could also be that a lot of students are independent and they just dont feel like working with other people. I remember that when I was younger I didn't like working with other kids, I was very independent. I didn't like when I was forced to do things with other kids. Since some students feel this way it would be a little sad that some kids would have be forced to do something that they dont like to do.

1e4a74074e74_04112023,"Dear Principal, 

I am writing regarding your consideration to require all students to perform community service. While helping our community is undoubtedly important, I do not think requiring community service is the best approach. 

There are some good reasons for encouraging community service, like helping those in need and teaching students the value of civic participation. Some of my friends have enjoyed their experiences tutoring younger students and cleaning up local parks. These activities allow them to feel good about contributing to others.

However, forcing students to volunteer their free time may backfire and reduce their motivation to help. Some of my other friends argue they need that time for other commitments like sports, music, jobs or simply relaxing after a long day of schoolwork. Requiring service could make them resentful of the obligation rather than passionate about serving their community. 

A better alternative might be to strongly promote community service as an option for students, not a mandate. The school could organize volunteer events and inform students of opportunities in the area to inspire more natural interest. For those who want to help but struggle to find time, the school could offer flexible service periods during lunch or after school. 

Overall, while the intentions are noble, mandatory community service risks having the opposite of the intended effect. Encouraging voluntary participation through information and opportunities seems more likely to foster long-term civic engagement among students. For these reasons, I do not think requiring all students to perform community service is the best approach. Please consider keeping it as an encouraged but not mandated activity.

Thank you for your consideration.

There is an ongoing debate on whether summer projects should be student or teacher-designed and the benefits of each. Teachers being the ones to design the project can lead to: students having clear standards of what needs to be done, more time managed project, and being stressed out. Some may that student design is better due to boosting tier moral and letting the project being something they can enjoy. Although some may disagree having a teacher designed project over school is more efficient and safe.

Teacher design based projects will be a lotÂ safer for the most part; Moreover, leaving less room for students to say something like not understanding,not enough time, and being stressed out. first thing is not knowing the standards of the project or understanding them. This could lead to a lotÂ of hiccups if this was a student designed project; Consequently stressing the students out. Time management is also crucial due even if a student has an entire summer. letting teachers plan the time it would best to gradually get it done would be great expecting it not to being able to be finish the day before its due. Some students might put it off until they cant any more probably messing up their sleep schedule trying to rush to finish the project Being stressed out is not a great feeling and can ultimately be a reason some students may just give up. Even if it is all planned out a multitude of factors kick in to be able to stress a student.

There are further reasons to letting the project be designed by the teacher. This can help grades if the project is done, can later reward the students by the teacher having faith in the students to do a multitude of other things. These rewards can help students want to finish projects and have a reason to be doing projects on time. Letting a student design his or her own project is a privilege and will ultimately be earned and boosting confidence getting closer to a student designed summer project. One problem for lots of students is that during the summer a lot of things are forgotten. I think having a project made by a teacher can help challenge the brain and keep it ready for when school is about to began. Doing that can improve performance in school on a daily basis.

Although some may disagree, the projects given over summer should be teacher-designed to limit problems.

The summer projects should be teacher designed due to the benefits given to students like limiting time management problems, helping students be ready for the upcoming your and what to look out for. some state that student designed projects wold be better due to less of a workload and boosting moral but this is not the case.

That's something minor but let's say you're driving while using you're device that's major, a car accident may be caused.

I believe cell phones should not be used while driving because it's a big distraction. Car wrecks would be avoided, which decreases the amounts of deaths.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to you as a concerned citizen and a high school student about the ongoing debate of the Electoral College versus popular vote for the election of the President of the United States of America. I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place to ensure that every vote counts and that every state has a voice in the election.

The Electoral College is a time-honored tradition that was established by the founding fathers of the United States. It was created to ensure that every state has a say in the election process, as opposed to just the states with larger populations. The Electoral College also ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process, which is critical in a country as large as the United States.

The Electoral College also helps to prevent fraud in the election process. It makes it much more difficult for fraudulent votes to be cast, as there are multiple layers of protection in place to prevent fraudulent votes from being counted. This is especially important in a country as large as the United States, where there are many different states with many different voting laws and regulations.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a degree of stability to the election process. It ensures that the President is elected by a clear majority, which helps to prevent confusion and chaos in the election process. This is especially important in times of crisis, where stability is critical to the functioning of our democracy.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place to ensure that every vote counts and that every state has a voice in the election. The Electoral College helps to prevent fraud, provides stability to the election process, and ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process. I urge you to support the Electoral College and to vote against any efforts to abolish it.

First off, let's talk about the advantages of working in a group. ð¤ When we work together, we can bounce ideas off each other and come up with way more creative solutions than we could on our own. Plus, it's way more fun! ð We can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and support each other when things get tough.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College system, rather than switching to election by popular vote, is crucial for protecting our democratic principles and ensuring a fair representation of all states within the country.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President through a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. The process involves the selection of electors, their meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The allocation of electors is based on each state's Congressional delegation, providing representation for both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is that it ensures certainty of outcome. Due to the winner-take-all system employed by most states, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents disputes over the outcome of the election, as the candidate who receives the majority of electoral votes is declared the winner. In contrast, a direct popular vote could potentially lead to prolonged disputes and recounting of votes, as seen in the 2000 election.

Another significant benefit of the Electoral College is the need for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This requirement encourages candidates to campaign across various regions and build a broad coalition of support. In turn, this helps to ensure that the winning candidate has national appeal and can effectively represent the interests of the entire country. Without this requirement, there is a risk of a candidate with only regional appeal winning the presidency, which could lead to feelings of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system places importance on swing states, thereby granting more attention to the issues and concerns of those states. Campaign efforts are concentrated in toss-up states, which leads to increased engagement and thoughtful voting among their residents. This ensures that swing states, and the diverse perspectives they represent, play a significant role in deciding the election outcome.

The Electoral College also helps to restore balance to the political influence of large and small states. While the Senate provides representation for small states through equal representation, the Electoral College allows large states to have a greater say in the election. This balance is crucial for ensuring that candidates do not solely focus on the concerns of heavily populated areas but also consider the interests of smaller states.

Lastly, the use of the Electoral College system avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This prevents additional complexity in the election process and ensures a clear winner is determined.

While there are arguments for switching to a direct popular vote, it is important to note that such a change would undermine the principles on which our electoral system was built. The Electoral College helps to maintain a balance of power between states, encourages broader national campaigns, and ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions of the country.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides essential benefits including certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, focus on swing states, balance of power between large and small states, and avoidance of run-off elections. By preserving the Electoral College, we can uphold the democratic principles and ensure fair representation for all states within our great nation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College and continue to support its retention in our presidential elections.

DA994B5C3784," Self-reliance is the ability to rely on one's own instincts and ideas. While some people may value self-reliance, I believe that it's important to seek guidance from experts and authorities when making important decisions in life. It's not always necessary to make decisions on your own, as experts have experience and knowledge that can help guide you in the right direction.

One example of when seeking guidance from experts is when dealing with a medical emergency. When I was sick at home with a lot of pain, I initially refused to go to the hospital, but after talking to a doctor, I realized that I needed to seek medical attention.

DF9E11F7A06E,"Ralph Waldo Emerson is well known for his musing that ""a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."" To him, it meant that life should be an ever-evolving journey of discovery rather than settling for what one already knows. Many people take this statement as an invitation to push past their comfort zone and take a step into the unknown. Although this message may be motivating, there are a few who disagree with Emerson's viewpoint. 

It can be argued that people can still grow and develop without trying something new. Taking time to reflect on the lessons already learned can lead to personal growth that foundations have been laid for. A person can also develop new skills within an already familiar subject, such as furthering the understanding of mathematics. 

Despite this, attempting something beyond what one has already mastered can be incredibly rewarding. By pushing beyond preconceived boundaries, people can open themselves up to fresh creative ideas and make incredible breakthroughs. In addition to this, people may develop transferable skills that can be applied to a variety of contexts. Finally, mastering something new may give a person the inspiration and confidence to attempt further feats.

E3097287CBD1,"Sure, I'll give it a try! Here's my essay on the advantages and disadvantages of traditional in-person educational instruction versus distance learning instruction:

As an 8th grader, I've had the opportunity to experience both traditional in-person educational instruction and distance learning. While both methods have their pros and cons, I believe that in-person instruction is more beneficial for students.

One of the main advantages of in-person instruction is the ability to interact with teachers and peers face-to-face. This allows for better communication and collaboration, which are essential for learning. In a classroom setting, students can ask questions, participate in discussions, and work together on projects. This face-to-face interaction helps to build relationships and create a sense of community, which can lead to better learning outcomes.

Another advantage of in-person instruction is the ability to get immediate feedback from teachers. When students are working on a project or assignment, they can ask for help and get immediate feedback from their teachers. This helps to identify any mistakes or areas where they need to improve, which can lead to better grades and better learning.

On the other hand, distance learning has its own set of advantages. One of the biggest advantages is the flexibility it offers. Students can complete coursework on their own time and at their own pace, which can be especially helpful for those who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas. This flexibility can also help students who may need to take breaks or who have difficulty with traditional classroom instruction.

However, distance learning also has its own set of disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is the lack of face-to-face interaction. Without the ability to interact with teachers and peers, students may feel isolated or disconnected from their learning. This can lead to a lack of motivation or engagement, which can negatively impact their learning outcomes.

Another disadvantage of distance learning is the potential for technical issues. When students are relying on technology to access course materials and complete assignments, technical issues can arise. This can include problems with connectivity, compatibility, or software glitches, which can be frustrating and time-consuming to resolve.

In my opinion, while distance learning has its advantages, in-person instruction is still",1,llama2_chat,Task: Research and compare the advantages and disadvantages of traditional in-person educational instruction versus distance learning instruction.

llama_70b_v1240,"Summer projects are a great way for students to continue learning during the break. I think that these projects should be student-designed. This way, students can choose a topic that they are interested in and that they will enjoy learning about. This will make the learning experience more enjoyable and meaningful for them.

For example, if a student is interested in science, they could design a project that involves conducting experiments and collecting data. They could then analyze the data and present their findings in a report or presentation. This will not only help them learn about science, but it will also give them the opportunity to develop their research and critical thinking skills.

On the other hand, if a teacher designs the project, it may not be as engaging for the student. The student may not have a choice in the topic, and they may not be as motivated to complete the project. This could lead to a negative learning experience, and the student may not learn as much.

Furthermore, student-designed projects allow students to take ownership of their learning. They can choose a topic that they are passionate about, and they can design the project in a way that is meaningful to them. This will help them develop their creativity and problem-solving skills, as well as their ability to work independently.

In conclusion, student-designed summer projects are the way to go. They allow students to take ownership of their learning, choose topics that they are interested in, and develop important skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving. These projects will be more engaging and meaningful for students, and they will help students continue learning during the summer break.",1,llama_70b_v1,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

Pushing Beyond Our Limits

Have you ever felt like you're stuck in a rut, like you're not reaching your full potential? I know I have. It's easy to get comfortable with what we know and what we're good at, but sometimes we need to push beyond our limits to grow and develop.

When we challenge ourselves to do things we're not used to, we learn new skills, gain confidence, and discover hidden talents. For example, I used to be really shy and introverted, but I decided to join the school play. It was scary at first, but with practice and determination, I was able to overcome my fears and perform in front of a big audience. I discovered that I had a talent for acting and it helped me become more outgoing and confident.

Moreover, pushing beyond our limits can help us develop resilience and perseverance. When we face challenges and obstacles, we learn to problem-solve and find ways to overcome them. This helps us become more resourceful and independent, which are important skills to have in life.

However, it's not always easy to push beyond our limits. It can be scary and uncomfortable, and we may feel like we're not good enough or smart enough. But the truth is, we are capable of more than we think. We just need to have the courage to try.

In conclusion, pushing beyond our limits is important for personal growth and development. It helps us discover new talents, gain confidence, and develop resilience.

I, PROPER_NAME, think it is best to keep the electoral colles, but here is why. Some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the consititution is restored. The candiate must have trans regional appleal, meaning he/she must be all for each region & not just one, (South, Northeastern, etc.).  From this the residents of the other region are likelt to feel disfranchised-- to feel like their votes do not count, and that with no regard for their interests, the president is not really the president.

As a citizen I would say that if the president, only did what half of the regions had said, then I would not be satisfied with what he is doing. When you go into office, you go into office for everyone, not just one region, but ALL regions. Wether or not the president haave a trans-appeal, each region does not have enough electoral votes to elect a president on their own anyway. Some say the electoral college is unfair. outdated, irrational, because they favor most daily assertions without much basis in reality. However the lectoral college, can be unfair. Most arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much base reality.

To feel as if the president is not on your side, i dont imagine that being any fun, that to me would be like rewarding one child and not the other for the same action. We all are equal, wether by race, color, or age. We are all human, and we demand to be treated equal, if we dont get equal, keep trying until you do. Its always too early to give up.

FEF2E1612F55,"Dear senator,

What are the chances in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states? Does the Electoral College work?

First of all, What is the electoral college? The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the selectors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president,and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

What's wrong with the electoral college? Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all systemin each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on the tight races in the ""swing""states. It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The bestÂ  arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elactions are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
6B2FD789B8C8," In today's fast-paced world, it is becoming increasingly important for individuals to have a work-life balance. This balance is crucial for maintaining overall well-being, productivity, and success. One way that some businesses have attempted to achieve this balance is by implementing a four-day work week. While this model may not be feasible for all businesses, schools could also benefit from adopting a similar approach by extending the school day.

One of the main benefits of a longer school day is that it would provide students with more time to relax and recharge. This is particularly important for young students who are still developing and need time to process information and engage in activities that promote growth and development. By having more time to relax, students can also reduce stress levels and improve their overall well-being.

In addition to benefiting students, a longer school day would also provide teachers with more time to relax and recharge. This is particularly important for teachers who often have to balance teaching responsibilities with family and personal commitments. By having more time to spend with their families and engage in activities that promote well-being, teachers can reduce stress levels and improve their overall well-being.

Another benefit of a longer school day is that it would provide students with more time to engage in activities that promote personal growth and development. This could include volunteering, exercising, reading, and other activities that help individuals to grow and learn. By providing students with more time to engage in these activities, schools can help to foster a culture of personal and professional development.

Furthermore, a longer school day could also help to improve academic performance. By providing students with more time to study and engage in other academic activities, schools can help to improve grades and test scores. This could be particularly beneficial for students who are struggling academically, as they would have more time to receive additional support and guidance from teachers.

In conclusion, a longer school day could provide numerous benefits for both students and teachers. By providing students with more time to relax, recharge, and engage in activities that promote personal growth and development, schools can help to foster a culture of well-being and success. Additionally, by providing teachers with more time to spend with their families and engage in activities that promote well-being, schools can help to reduce stress levels and improve overall teacher satisfaction.

7D94F809823A," In recent years, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. From online shopping to social media, technology has made it easier than ever to complete various tasks. However, some people argue that technology has a negative impact on our lives, limiting our ability to interact with others and causing negative emotions. While technology can be beneficial in many ways, I strongly disagree with this statement.

Firstly, technology has made it possible for us to communicate with people from all over the world. Social media platforms, for example, have made it possible for us to connect with people we may never have had the opportunity to meet otherwise. This ability to communicate with others has opened up new opportunities for collaboration and learning. Additionally, technology has made it possible for us to access information from all over the world, allowing us to learn about different cultures and perspectives.

Secondly, technology has made it possible for us to complete various tasks more efficiently. Online shopping, for example, has made it possible for us to purchase items from the comfort of our own homes, saving us time and energy. Similarly, online banking and financial management tools have made it possible for us to manage our finances more effectively. These technological advancements have made our lives more convenient and efficient.

However, it is important to note that technology is not a replacement for human interaction. While technology has made it possible for us to communicate with others online, it is important to remember that face-to-face communication is still crucial for building and maintaining healthy relationships. Additionally, technology can be damaging to our health if we rely on it too heavily. Excessive use of technology can lead to eye strain, poor posture, and even addiction.

In conclusion, while technology has made many aspects of our lives more convenient and efficient, it is important to remember that it is not a replacement for human interaction.

622ECD91DA0C," The idea that first impressions are set in stone is a common misconception. While it is true that initial judgments can be difficult to change, it is also possible to alter these first impressions with further interaction and understanding.

For example, you may meet someone who has a lot of tattoos and you may have a negative first impression of them. However, as you get to know this person better and learn more about their background and personality, you may find that they are not the person you initially thought they were. In this way, you can change your first impression of someone based on their appearance.

It is also important to remember that people are complex individuals with their own unique experiences and struggles. You cannot judge someone solely based on their appearance or what others have said about them. Instead, it is important to take the time to get to know the person and understand their perspective.

In addition, it is important to recognize that everyone has their own problems and challenges that they may not be aware of. You cannot assume that someone is struggling with a particular issue simply based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, it is important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding.

It is also important to recognize that first impressions can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the situation and the person's mood. For example, someone may have a bad first impression of you if they are having a bad day or if they are in a bad mood. In this way, it is important to be mindful of how you present yourself and the context in which you are interacting with others.

Also in the text it said that when a student is confused or bored it can tell that they are so the computer will give them a problem they understand.

Also the computer know the percentages of your feeling the computer can tell you that your 80% happy and that your 10% mad and your 10% bored.

The computer can also tell if you dislike the ad its showing so it wont show anything similar to it but if it shows that you like the ad the computer will put another ad similar to the one you smiled or laughed at. Dr. Huang and his colleague made this kind of computer so that we humans can have better computers and better ways to communicate with each other.

Maybe if we had a bunch of fun volunteering projects kids could do through school it would make it easier for them to see volunteering doesn't have to be just like picking up trash (which is a good thing but honestly no fun) you could go to a pet shelter and play with the animals. Or I always that it would be fun to train service dogs for the blind or something like that. Or go to a soup kitchen and feed the homeless, that's what I do.

This program can be used in classrooms to find out when a student is bored or confuse, this can help teachers chage their lessons to something that can keep a students active and focased on there studies. As long as the software can only read emotions, read if a student is lying or not and make help make lessons more active, I am for its use in schools.

This program can only read six basic emotions- happiness, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and each are associated with different characteristic movements. The way it reads your emotions is by constructing a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles in order for the program to read each emotion. In class this can be used to find confused and bored students and then help the teacher change the lesson so that they can understand it better or become more focased on the lesson. This can help effectively raise grades for students who are prone to becoming confused and bored.

Now this can also be used to figure out if a student or convict is lying or not. Muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. Now if someone is fake smiling or keeping a strait face while lying the program can use that to help notify people if someone is lying or not.

The program can help make classes and students, more active and controlled. When knowing if a class is confused or bored can make a big diffence because the lesson or teacher can then be changed to the students likeing so the class can continue on focased and active. Which helps students whom are prone to get distracted.

As long as this program can help students in these ways than schools should invest in this program to keep their students active in their lessons. So then schools wont have to continue constanly be trying new things to figure out how to keep their active and focased. ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

F5D85379A614,"Over the last two decades, cell phones have become very popular. Today, almost everyone has a cell phone, especially if they are old enough to drive. Cell phone use while driving has become a big controversy over the last few years and many people have faced the consequences of texting, calling, or searching their cell phones while operating a vehicle. With that being said, there are several reasons why people should not use their phones while driving. These reasons can be classified into a couple of different categories, including safety and legal reasons.

The first reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in injury or death for the driver or someone else. This could pose a safety hazard and would therefore fall under the safety category. Statistically, there are 1.6 million car crashes that are caused by texting and driving each year. Almost 390,000 injuries each year from accidents involve a cell phone or other device. Also, 1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the U.S. Therefore, there is always a risk that an accident will happen as a result of cell phone use and could harm anyone involved in the accident.

The second reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in property damage for the driver or someone else, which could pose a safety hazard but could also result in someone pressing charges. Therefore, this could be classified under the safety category and the legal category. As mentioned above, crashes due to cell phone use while driving are very common in the United States. It can cause damage to other vehicles, houses, and or company buildings. Whatever your insurance doesn't cover you have to pay out of pocket and these damages can get really expensive. Any insurance claim could also cause your monthly payments to go up.

The last reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it is against the law in many states such as Georgia, which would fall under the legal category. On July 1, 2018, Georgia passed a Hands-Free law that basically says that anyone driving a motor vehicle on a highway in Georgia is not allowed to hold a phone with any part of their bodies. A first-time offense for using a cell phone and driving is $50, the second is $100, and the third is $150. Each offense after the third one is also $150 each. Every offense is a misdemeanor that would go on your permanent record.

There are multiple reasons why you should not use your phone while driving. This distracted driving can lead to car wrecks that could cause harm to you, to someone in your car, or to anyone else involved in the accident. An accident could also cause damage to your car, to someone else's car, or to homes, buildings, and other property damage. It is also illegal in many other states so if you are caught you could be fined up to $150 and it would go on your permanent record. Because of these potential safety hazards and legal issues, it is best to not use a cell phone while driving a vehicle.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

The Seagoing Cowboys program is in need of help from other herders.

Why would anyone want to do this? With the program, you are able to help out other people, do things you typically would not do, and have fun.

I think it is beneficial to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you are able to help out people.

It is important to help people because not only does it benefit them, it benefits you as well by bringing joy in to your life.

In the text it states that in 1945,

World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.

This is just one reason why this program is beneficial.

Another reason why I think that joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is beneficial is becuase you get to do different things in your free time that you would not normally get to do.

In the text it says that they got to tour many places.

My final reason why I think that joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is beneficial is because you get to have fun.

In the text, it says that while they were unloading the animals, they played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading and even whittling.

These are just a few reasons why I think that people who join the program will have lots of fun.

In conclusion to all of this, I think the Seagoing Cowboys program is beneficial to all.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
3448f48efed1_04112023,"Limiting car usage has numerous benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. Reducing reliance on personal vehicles can positively impact environmental sustainability, public health, and urban infrastructure. 

One of the key advantages of limiting car usage is improved environmental sustainability. Automobiles are a major contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. According to Passage 1, transportation accounts for over a quarter of total U.S. carbon emissions. By driving less and utilizing alternative modes of transportation like public transit, biking, or walking, individuals can significantly lower their personal carbon footprint. This reduction in vehicle emissions would help mitigate the impacts of climate change. Limiting car usage would also lessen other forms of pollution like smog and toxic particulate matter from tailpipes, creating healthier air for communities.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage promotes public health. As noted in Passage 2, sedentary transportation like driving encourages a more sedentary lifestyle with negative health outcomes. Opting for active transit like biking or walking whenever possible allows individuals to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. Regular exercise through active transportation can help reduce risks for obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers. On a systemic level, less congestion and more physical activity would benefit public health outcomes for entire urban populations. 

Finally, reducing car dependency can positively impact urban infrastructure and city planning. According to Passage 3, personal vehicles consume a disproportionate amount of urban land through roads, parking lots and driveways. By utilizing alternatives to driving, cities would need fewer roads, parking spaces and related infrastructure. This opened up land could be repurposed for parks, affordable housing or other public uses that improve quality of life. Active transit would also lessen traffic congestion, reducing commuting stresses and improving pedestrian and cyclist safety.

In conclusion, limiting car usage through individual behavior changes and shifts in societal priorities would create widespread environmental, health and infrastructural advantages. Minor reductions in driving, even if adopted gradually, could make significant impacts if embraced widely. Overall, curbing car dependency represents a practical strategy for building a more sustainable, healthy and livable future.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,7
12E285708DA2,"''Are you kidding me, you actually think that figure on mars was created by aliens?'' ''Yeah I do, if it isn't aliens then who or what made that face on mars.''

''I dont know how that got there, but i'm telling you now it wasn't made by aliens.''

As you can see the three different photos showing the figure on mars was just a misunderstanding. In the 1976 photo it looks blury, but in 1998 and 2001 photos you can see it more cleary. In the article it states '' The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.'' So that means the clouds made it look like a face.

Also during 1976 the pixels on the camera could have been bad so it could't take clear pictures. In the image 3 it shows it more clearly, so that means technology has gotten better. According to the article it says ''Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That proves that the camera in 2001 was better then the camera in 1976.

Nobody will ever know if aliens made that figure on mars that looks like a face.

It could have been a butte or a mesa. For example in the passage it states ''There must have beem a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

4206A326928C,"I believe that when you participate in one or two extracurricular activities,you should be set for a good college in the near future. Activities such as sports,student counseling ,and working on the year book. any of that can give you a better G.P.A,and will also give you extra things to do right after school.

When colleges see your records from the past years,from middle school,through high school,they want to see one of your biggest achievements,good grades and to see if you have any other hobbies outside of school as a daily routine or to see if you are working really hard as the student.

Colleges love to see a person working hard for something important,like an education. They like to see kids who give off effort for what they are doing,they also see and look into kids that can go pro in any sport in the future and people who are advanced in academics and learning.

Doing other activities can set a healthier mind set,a healthierÂ body,and can help you set personal goals in life that you wish to achieve, along with a good planner you need when going to college. Also by doing all this you can set a good prime example for a younger sibling of yours.

So out of this i'm saying,by doing the extra activities given to you can really help set aside a goal in your life and me reading this i think that the principle should make kids in middle school do extra activities after school to get in the habit of for high school cause its really going to help them with a better future when going for a university.",0,persuade_corpus,,9

E6A0D625F9C3,"Knowledge is a powerful tool that can lead to the creation of real things and financial success. Throughout history, people have used their knowledge to invent new products and services that have changed the world. In this essay, I will explore the idea that knowledge creates real things and can lead to financial success by analyzing examples of knowledge being used to create inventions, people making money from those inventions, and the idea of knowledge being powerful.

One of the most well-known examples of knowledge being used to create an invention is the story of the Wright Brothers. In 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright successfully flew the first powered airplane. Their invention revolutionized transportation and opened up new opportunities for travel and commerce. The Wright Brothers' success was due to their knowledge of aerodynamics, engineering, and physics, which they used to design and build their aircraft.

Another example of knowledge being used to create an invention is the development of the internet. The internet was created by scientists and engineers who used their knowledge of computer science and engineering to develop a global network of interconnected computers. Today, the internet has become an essential tool for communication, commerce, and entertainment, and has led to the creation of countless new businesses and industries.

People have also made money from inventions created using knowledge. For example, the Wright Brothers' invention of the airplane led to the development of the airline industry, which has generated billions of dollars in revenue over the years. Similarly, the internet has led to the creation of new businesses and industries such as e-commerce, social media, and online advertising.

In addition to creating real things and generating financial success, knowledge is also powerful. Knowledge is the foundation of all scientific and technological advancements, and has the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing problems. For example, knowledge of genetics has led to the development of new medical treatments and cures for diseases, while knowledge of renewable energy sources has led to the development of new technologies that can help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.

In conclusion, knowledge creates real things and can lead to financial success. Throughout history, people have used their knowledge to invent new products and services that have changed the world. The Wright Brothers' invention of the airplane, the development of the internet, and the creation of the airline industry are just a few examples of how knowledge has been used",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,1
58B7F73691D2,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" technology is used to read the emotional expressions of people called the Facial Action Coding System, I think that it is a very useful thing because with this you have so many advantages like being able to tell if a student likes a lesson or is bored with it.

When using Facial Action Coding System their are many good reasons to use it for example paragraph 6 says ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similiar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next add will be different. also classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, and could modify the lesson for the student. FACS works by whatching 44 major muscles in your face to see how they move to determine your expression.

Although this is a great tool to use when trying to teach students it is probably very expensive to have it installed into computers for students nationwide. Also some poeple may not like the fact that they are a computer is able to read their emotions and may reject this tool. For some students it may not even help them and would rather talk to a teacher for help rather than use a computer.

Even though there are some down sides to using Facial Action Coding System it is still a very good tool to use in the classroom or anywhere needed. FACS can classify six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness just by seeing the the movements of your facial muscles.

I think that using this tool is a great way to improve several things and by looking at my examples I have shown that using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a very valuable tool.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
6A83BE6517EE,"Every day people wake up, get ready, and go to work or school. The way they get there can vary but for the most part, people drive cars. That's about to change. Helping the enviroment and becoming more relaxed are advanatages for limiting car usage.

By reducing car usage, emmitions produced from automobiles can be reduced and help the enviroment. When cars reslease gas into the air, it causes smog which traps the gases and inhibits them from being able to escape the atomosphere. In largely congested cities smog can be as harmful as 147 micrograms of particulate matter as seen in Paris, France (paragraph 17). Paris enfored a partial driving ban due the amount of smog and just after one day of reduced driving, the smog clears enough so they didn't have to enforce the ban another day (paragraph 19). Passenger cars are resonsible for 12 percent of greeenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the United States. (paragraph 5). This staggering statistic can open your eyes to how much cars really effect the envrioment. If just once a week you didn't use your car, you could reduce greenhouse gases drastically. In the United States today, recent studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, and are driving less. (paragraph 29). Since 1995, the number of miles driven per person dropped almost 9 percent (paragraph 32). With lesser people buying and driving new cars, gas emissions could change drastically within a few years and could help our evrioment exonentialy.

When you do not drive a car to from places every day, you become a more relaxed person. In Vauban, Germany- residents have given up cars almost all together, only 30 percent of residents owning cars. In this Suburban town, it seems comman for mothers to own a minivan to ship children back and forth all throughout town; Heidrun Walter feels other wise. She has given up her automobile to get around town and ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walter states. (paragraph 3). For the past three years in Bogota, Colombia they take a day out of the year where only taxis and buses are permitted, the Day Without Cars. Even when dark clouds circled around the city and rain splattered down onto the heads of people, they didn't revert back to their cars. A businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (paragraph 24). This day has become so popular, two other cities in Columbia joined in as well the celebrate the day where people do not use their cars. People do not need to meet with other people in order to go to work or hangout with friends anymore; they can be in their own homes using the technology they access see their friends and continue to do their work.(paragraph 35). Without having to commute to an office, people feel less stressed and more relaxed being able to do their work in the comfort of their own home.

People used to accossicate cars as the best way to get from place A to B without thinking about the consequences it can have on the planet or on yourself. You have to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. What can you do to help change the world?

E52ADC86DFFC,"The saying that âfirst impressions are almost impossible to changeâ is one that often rings true in many situations. While the truth of this statement largely depends on the individualâs personality, experiences, and expectations regarding the particular person or situation they are encountering, it often holds true that a personâs initial impressions of something or someone can be hard to change. For example, if a person first sees another person they deem as unapproachable, unfriendly, or unkind, it may be quite difficult to convince them to give that person a second chance. This becomes especially true when the negative first impression is based on physical appearances, pre-existing prejudices, or any type of prior knowledge of the person/situation in question.  

On the other hand, there are also instances when first impressions are not necessarily set in stone and can be changed with deliberate effort and the willingness to look past oneâs initial judgment. As humans, we are capable of recognizing our own biases and can learn to consider anotherâs opinion without jumping to conclusions. With the right attitude and a readiness to learn and understand, it is possible to modify oneâs first impressions and develop a more accurate evaluation of the person or situation in question. 

In conclusion, while first impressions are usually hard to shake off completely, it is definitely not an impossible feat. It takes an open mind and patience to change oneâs opinion and create a different perspective, but with the right attitude it is achievable.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Write an essay providing examples and reasons to support your opinion on whether or not it is true that first impressions are almost impossible to change.,5
F1329DA98283,"How much can we accomplish if we are always doing? Thomas Jefferson once wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I think he is right, if you think about it, the more you do, the more you will get and learn.

Over time, we've seen how many people had accomplish their dreams and goals, because they were always trying and working hard for what they wanted and what they needed. If we are always working hard, we can achieved what we want and even more, I think that's what Jefferson wanted to said with his words, the more you learn and do over your life, the more you will get, people will need you, and because they will need you, they would do whatever they can to get you.

Let me put you an example, think about your job, imagine you work in a restaurant, and you start as a cashier, and then you start to learn more, like you start to work in preparation, and then you put your hands in the kitchen, over time, you learn the system of the restaurant, how it work and everything; next thing you know you are the manager, but then you get tired and you quit your job, so then you can open your own place, and thanks to all you did in the restaurant now you have the experience to run your own place, and even better. Everything you get in your life will be thanks to all you try and learn, because even though sometimes things get difficult, it will always have a reward at the end.

This is like when we were kids, and our parents made us do things that we didn't like, for example, when I was a kid I hated to do my reading and writing homework, because I didn't know to do it, but now that I think about it, thanks to all the homework I did, now I know how to read and write in Spanish and English, because even though I didn't want to do my homework, my parents push me to do it, to learn and to be better every day. When I was a kid, my grandma always told me to said ""excuse me and thank you,"" at some point I did it because my grandma told me to do it, but now I see that my grandma though me something a lot of people forgot to do. Everything we learn make us better everyday.

Some people may believed inactivity is also something good; sometimes doing nothing, is doing more, and is okay to just stop everything and take a break once in a while, but just wait to see if things work by their own is not the best, if you want things to work in your life you have to work hard and never stop, because if you don't work for what you want nobody else will do it for you.

""It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing,"" Thomas Jefferson was right it is wonderful to see what we can do if we never stop.

The first impresions is when you current know at someone or something. It is the first opinion that you mind create, but this impresions or idea can change when you start to know better. When we current know a person, our mind create a idea that can be false or true, but is something that only can know with the time.

The change can affect or can benefit, that means that sometimes we thinks that is good and bad, thinks that is bad and is good. A example of affect is when we buy a car, and these is look like beautiful for autside, but when a mechanical check inside descover that have many damage. A example of benefit is when somebody told you something bad of other person, and when you talk with that person you descover that is false.

All these can have influence when you change your impresions of someone or something. For example, when we are angry all is look like bad or annoying. Other example, when we make a autocorrection of something that we believed that was bad or incorrect.

9C6132E41DDE,"Working alone and working in groups both have their advantages, but I believe that working alone is preferable for students. While working in groups can provide a sense of collaboration and support, it can also lead to distractions and decreased productivity. Working alone allows students to focus on their work and take responsibility for their own learning, which can lead to better academic performance and personal growth.

One advantage of working alone is that it allows students to work at their own pace. When working in a group, students may feel pressure to keep up with their peers or to compromise on their ideas, which can lead to decreased productivity. Working alone allows students to take the time they need to fully understand and complete their work, without feeling rushed or pressured.

Another advantage of working alone is that it allows students to take ownership of their learning. When working in a group, students may rely on others to do their part, which can lead to a lack of accountability and responsibility. Working alone allows students to take responsibility for their own learning and to make their own decisions about how to approach a task. This can lead to a greater sense of personal ownership and pride in one's work.

Finally, working alone can provide a sense of privacy and focus. When working in a group, students may feel distracted by the noise and activity of their peers. Working alone allows students to create a quiet and focused workspace, which can lead to increased productivity and better academic performance.

In conclusion, while working in groups can provide a sense of collaboration and support, it can also lead to distractions and decreased productivity.

8E0A4CFAEA9C,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I strongly believe that students should not be allowed to have their cell phones out during school hours. Students will be able to focus better, students won't be late to class, and students will not distract others.

To start off, students should not be able to have cell phones out during school hours so they can focus better. If a student is on their cell phone during class they will not be learning anything and will most likely fail. Education is very important because if you are well educated you can get a scholarship into college and have a wonderful career. But if you are not well educated you will not get any of those things and you will most likely end up getting paid minimum wage.

Furthermore, students should not be allowed to have cell phones out during school hours so they won't be late to class. If a student is tardy twice to class they will receive a detention and the next tardy after that will be a referral. Those will affect your discipline record and won't get you into college either. At school, cell phone use is just not necessary and shouldn't be tolerated at all. Also, if your are late you will have missed the class instruction and as well as some academic material needed to pass that class.

Last, students should not be allowed to have cell phones out during school hours because it can distract other students from their work. I remember this time when my class was taking an important test and one of my classmates cell phone rang and that student got a zero on that test. If a students phone rings during class another student could be distracted and waste time off of that assignment and also lose credit because the work was incomplete.

But I think that the limited amount of car usage would be great for the earth. My reason being is that car's make people excersize less, causes smog , bad for the enviroment.

To begin with, i think that limited amount of car usage is good for lazy people. I mean people will waste gas just to drive 3 minutes to a store when you could walk to save gas. It really makes no sense that a average person could be so lazy. You can be doing two good things at one time. By just walking for your health and saving up on gas,The text says,""Many experts expect public transport serving suburs to play a much larger role.

Next, I think it is a good idea because it wont cause so much smog which is a bad thing for the air. According to the text,""Paris has banned driving due to smog Paris enforced a partial driving bad to clear the air of the global city"". The last thingwe need to do is be breathing in dirty air and pretty much gas. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. Twenty seven people had there cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

Also, My final reason is that it is bad for the enviroment. Luckily The text says,""President Obama's ambitious goals to curn the united states"". Its about time some one point out the wrong honestly in my opnion if i was president i would ban driving to unless your like traveling to a far out state or your work is really far. I think that is should not be allowed.

So to sum it all up, I think that a limited amount of car usage would be good for the enviroment. And have a good impact on the world. Once again my reasons for it is that make's people excersize less, causes smog , bad for the enviroment. So my fellow citizens think about what you are doing to the world and how it not only effects us but how it also effects you.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

I think you should let us have cell phones in school. Cell phones could be useful in times of needs. Like if they have a person in the school, who shouldn't be there, We (The Students) could call the cops incase if the teacher doesn't have no device to make calls with. There wouldn't be anyone else there to make the call

When Its school times we can just turn them off, so that they won't distract the other kids from learning. We all know phones can be distracting when your phone come on, but its just a little distraction. It doesn't mean that their just going to forget the subject all the sudden.

People just know that when kids have cell phone during school time all were going to do is text during class. Its not true because there wouldn't be no point of school if your just going to text during class the whole day.

Actually, when you're texting, the phone will show you that's your making errors and you will eventually correct yourself. That is almost like the subject English. In ELA, don't we correct sentences and stuff like that? Its just like texting your friends. You have to send them messages with correct spelling.

So all I say is that we should just have cell phones during school. It can help us in the future one day.

CFBCF638F69D,"Summer is the time of the year most people enjoy. Students usually enjoy this time the most. However, there is one thing that can completely ruin it. Summer projects, something most kids would cry if they heard they had to do them. Most students show hatred towardsÂ them because it takes away from their favorite time of the year, summer! Most students forget or just chose not to complete them. Summer projects were created to keep students learning during long breaks. Teacher's usually assign these students topics. However, I believe if you give students the responsibility of choosing their own projects they would strive to complete them and mature mentally as young adults should. Student-designed projects see more completion, interest, and improvement than the average assignment. I, as a student, would want control over my project. I typically do not do as well with teacher topics as well as some of my other fellow students.

When teachers design their summer projects they use topics that fit into the lesson plan or that interest them personally. This is not fair to the student. If a student received a topic that they hated they would, more than likely, fail that project. There are a lot students who would toughen up and do the project, but most students are not like that. They will put in minimal effort towards the project just enough to pass if that. This effects grades and does not show a students true ability to perform outside the learning environment.

Humans grow in controlled situations. We as the students should be given that opportunity to grow by controlling our project. If students chose their own topics there would show a lot more effort in completion of the project. This improves the want to learn, has a better effect on grades, and learning mentality improves tremendously. Students would take more time for better results and show select skills taught by teachers, which is what teachers want to see.

I believe student-designed is the way to go. Giving us the power also gives us motivation to do it. I strive when I can do research on things I like or have a slight interest in. It is a completely different experience when you can learn about what you want to versus being in a classroom forced to learn about boring topics. For example, the American Revolution or chemical equations. By giving us topics were at an automatic disadvantage with a 32% higher chance of failure.

In other words, students have better performance with self-liked topics. Teacher-designs typically get less attention and a lot more failures from students. Finally, if you want better results from your students give them a little power every now and then. We strive in those situations made by ourselves contrasted to the ones picked out for us.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
B6B85CE5C8F5,"When it comes to trying to be someone, is it better to improvise or follow the script all the time?

Everyone needs to have their own individuality and be original instead of trying to be something else because that way you learn more about yourself. Also, you are acknowledging different methods about how to be better than yourself. And one of the most important things, you could make a good influence in someone else's life and teach him/her how to find their path in their own way. No matter what happens, you always have to follow yourself.

When you learn more about yourself it means that you do not just learn things that you already know about yourself, you also learn new things that you did not know about yourself. For example, one day you are going to the basement of your house which is really big and put some good music. While you are listening to your favorite songs from your playlist, you are dancing according to the tempo and doing the dancing moves that you usually do. After dancing for a long while, suddenly you let the music take control over you and you make a back flip without practicing it before. You are very surprised because you did something that you did not know you could do and after that, you keep practicing that move and perfectioning it and it comes out natural. That is how you learn more about yourself.

You are acknowledging different methods to be better than yourself. This means you will do whatever is right in order to become a better person. For example, Robert Downey Jr used to have a terrible life by consuming drugs and other things that got him in trouble with the law. He even went to court for all the messy things he did. After a long time taking bad decisions, he finally decided to make things better for the people who cares about him and specially for him. It took him over 5 years for him to get back on his feet; with his own effort and the support from his family and friends, he started to make a good difference for the world. Right now, Robert is one the best actors in Hollywood, he has an excellent life with his wife and kids on his side, and is a great influence for millions of people. That is how you acknowledge different methods to be better that yourself.

Some people say that you are copying someone else when you try to be yourself. However, they are wrong because you actually are listening to those tips that you have heard and following them under your own perspective. That way you are definitely writing your own script but at the same time, giving the deserved credit to the person who gave you those tips. For instance, when you are trying to get a girl that you met in a party but you have no idea of what to do in order to get her attention. You ask your friend for some advice to accomplish your goal so you do not go through a bad experience. He tells you what to do exactly and shows you with some women at the party and now you have some ideas of what you can do. So before you reach out to that girl, your friend tells you ""be yourself all the time"" and you get the courage to talk to her. After following those examples in your own way, the girl started to have deep feelings for you and everything worked out a lot well and make some influence to some of your friends who need that kind of help. That is how you follow your own script with your own terms.

In conclusion, it is very important that you have be yourself all the time because it shows that you do not need somebody in order to be somebody. You learn about yourself so you can get to know your own person more than you can know about an anime character. You acknowledge new ways to become better than yourself like if you were in a videogame, you are going to the next level slowly. You make a good influence by doing things as right as possible and you give people some benefits out of it. To be yourself you have to do what your gut tells you to do if you think it is going to give some benefits in some way.",0,original_moth,"Task:

D948703E8026,"Adopting a 10 p.m. weekday and midnight weekend curfew for teenagers is a somewhat divisive issue, as it has both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, after-hours access to teenage hotspots would be restricted, and fewer late-night incidents involving minors would be reported. Furthermore, research suggests that teenagersâ brains may be wired to operate better when they receive sufficient amounts of sleep. With a 10 p.m. curfew, concerned guardians can be more relaxed about knowing that their children are getting enough rest and are safe at home. 

On the other hand, implementing a curfew could be perceived as the city council being overbearing and intrusive to the lives of minors, violating their freedoms and liberties. Furthermore, the enforcement of this curfew may be difficult and costly. Teenagers could also be discouraged from engaging in extracurricular activities and after-school programs that might satisfy their educational and/or creative needs, since these activities often run past 10 p.m. Even worse, the curfew may be seen as an invitation for teenagers to break the law, thus leading to further crime and legal issues.

e96c53a6,"What would it be like to live in a society without the use of cars? Well some cities and even countries have begun to limit car usage such as VAUBAN, Germany where ""70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars""Source 1. There happens to be many advantages to limiting car usage such as: less pollution, less stress, and better cities. The positives of limiting car usage are very great and would have a positive effect on any city willing to set up these limitations.

The first advantage of limiting car usage is the effect it will have on the environment. According to Source 1, ""cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"". All this pollution and emission not only effects the environment but also leads to ""intensifying smog""source 2 which is not only bad for the environment but also bad for people. The use of cars may not be the only source of emission, but it is ""the second largest source of America's emissions""source 4. Many cities have already realized this and have begun limitations on car usage. Just think if all cities put a limitation on car usage how much fewer the percent of emissions would be and how great of an effect it would have on the environment.

Another positive of car limitation is its impact on cities, towns, and comunities. Bogota a city in Colombia participating in the limitation of car usage has seen the positive effects on there city. Bogota ""has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" which means more people biking which means less people using cars which means healthier peoplesource 3. This city also has seen an increase in the building of parks and sports centers, restraunts, shopping districts, and smooth sidewalks. Limitations on cars also leads to an improvement of the town's people, because people such as Carlos Arturo have used the limitations as ""an opportunity to take away stress""source 3 or vaughn's Heidran Walter who just feels less tense and ""much happier""source 1. Not only will these limitations positively effect cities but positively effect the overall mood of the people too.

There is a long list of advantages of limiting car usage. The advantages include: a healthier environment, improved cities, and happier people. Limitation has already started in many cities arouend the world, because these cities see the many advantages to limiting car usage.",0,train_essays,,1

BCAE5B0783CF,"The way we tech is constantly evolving, technology is a big part of that evolution. Technology has helped us make learning become faster and less reliant on teachers. Technology can also help with leaning outside of the traditional classroom. Something that could be a big help for the schools allowing for students to attend classes from their own home. Attending classes at home isn't a new idea, it has been around for a few years now in certain school districts, not to mention with homeschooling. Students can benefit from this if they're sick and or injured where they really can't go to school, or kids who work better in better environmentsÂ than the traditional classroom, or even the people who just don't want to go into school to do classes they can do from the comfort of their own home.

People get sick or injured often, sometimes it can be so bad they're put on home boundÂ which is when they aren't supposed to leave their home to go to school normally. In those cases the students could benefit from taking online classes. Online classes allow kids to work at a pace that is comfortable for them and if a student had a question they could have a call with their teacher to clear anything up they didn't understand. Another thing that is beneficial is being able to have a group call to do classroom specific learning, like calling the student to work with their classmates via the call, or calling together other kids in similar situations to recap with them what happened in their classes.

Classrooms are for most people a great way to learn a topic, others can have difficulty learning in such an environment. With the rise of mental health awareness in the past few years, and being able to identity kids who might be special needs, some schools haven't done enough to make those kids comfortable in a learning setting. Some kids might find it easier than others to work in a classroom, the other kids who find it more difficult should be able to take classes in their homes. This innovation could make it so more kids could be integrated into the public schools, especially if we hired teachers for their needs and allowed then a safe place for them outside of the normal classrooms. Something like this could be a huge step forward into more open and accepting schools.

Unlike the other two points this is a bit more up to the parents and school. Students who may not want to work in classes should be able to have a choice to work from home. This would be very close to home schooling, but it could allow the kid to be more involved in their school. An example of how this could work is one day a kid could go to school for a certain amount of classes and the next day take all their required classes online. The classes could be taught by teachers with the county or teachers specifically hired for such a thing. This would allow kids to have more free choice with how they receive their education. This is seen in some counties around the state, where special centers are created for kids who want to do something other than traditional schooling.

All these reasons are why potentially having online classing and video calls from home as a form of education could be really beneficial. Not only will it give the kids more options on how they learn but also create a change to your typical classroom. If you were to offer this to most students today they'd agree because this could be the future of the school systems in America which have been the same for decades. Schools around the world have been constantly changing the ways they teach to help better adapt to how the students learn best. This change might also raise the rate of graduation and lower drop out rates in our schools. Change is inevitableÂ and we should go with it instead of allowing our teaching methods get stuck in the past.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

D875C4365BC3,"Attitude: The Powerhouse of Personality

Attitude, a term that is often used in our daily lives, holds immense power in shaping our personality and influencing our experiences. It is the way we view things, the way we react to situations, and the way we interact with others. In this essay, I will delve into the definition of attitude and its impact on a person's life, exploring both the English and Spanish perspectives.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, attitude is defined as ""a way of thinking or feeling about something."" It is a mental state or a point of view that determines how we approach life's challenges and opportunities. In Spanish, the term ""actitud"" holds a similar meaning, emphasizing the idea that our attitudes can greatly affect our interactions with others and our overall well-being.

In my own life, I have experienced the power of attitude firsthand. Growing up, I had a negative attitude towards school, often viewing it as a chore rather than an opportunity for growth. As a result, I often found myself disengaged and unmotivated in class, leading to poor grades and a lack of interest in learning. This negative attitude not only affected my academic performance but also impacted my relationships with my peers and teachers.

However, as I grew older and gained a better understanding of the importance of a positive attitude, I began to shift my perspective. I started to view school as a chance to learn and develop new skills, rather than just a burden. I began to take initiative in my studies, asking questions and participating in class, which led to improved grades and a more fulfilling educational experience.

The impact of this shift in attitude was significant. Not only did my grades improve, but I also found myself feeling more confident and motivated in all aspects of my life. I began to apply the same positive attitude towards other areas, such as sports and extracurricular activities, which led to greater success and satisfaction.

In conclusion, attitude plays a crucial role in shaping our personality and influencing our experiences. By adopting a positive attitude, we can open ourselves up to new opportunities and experiences, while a negative attitude can hinder our growth and success. As the saying goes, ""attitude is everything,""",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Research and analyze the definition of ""attitude"" and its impact on a person's life.

B44F645BFD65,"Why We Shouldn't Use FACS Technology in Classroom

FACS technology shouldn't be used in classrooms, and there are several good reasons as to why. Some of the things that people value the most are their money, a good education, and privacy. Implementing FACS technology can disrupt all of these things that people value.

First of all, the author of this article, Nick D'Alto, never even mentions the cost of this technology. Seeing as this technology isn't even fully developed yet, it would presumably cost millions of dollars in research to even get a fully developed working product. When new technology comes out, it is usually more expensive then anything else on the market. A school is the last place that should be using its resources for an emotion reading system. Most schools are lacking funding and resources, which is leading to cuts in many music and athletic departments. Another pretty well known fact is that schools spend less money on cafeteria food then JAILS do. If a school is getting additonal funding these are the types of things that they should be spending it on, not useless emotion readers.

This goes into the second reason, which is effectiveness and practicality. How do we know that what this computer is saying is actually correct. Sometimes, there are some things that advanced technology just cannot solve. A computer may sense a sad or confused look on a student's face, but that doesn't necessarily tell you WHY they are sad or confused. Dr. Huang from the article says that based off of the look on your face, the computer could modify the lesson. First of all, if a teacher is teaching a lesson, it probably wouldn't want a computer modifying what he or she wants to do. A teacher shouldn't modify the whole lesson for the entire class, just because someone has a certain look on their face, for reasons that may not even be school related. Modifying a lesson for students who aren't even struggling could potentiall ruin the way they learn, and how quickly and effectively they learn and understand concepts. If a teacher senses that a certain student is confused or not paying attention, they could always talk to them after class and fix the problem, which is a much more effecient and effective way of doing it.

A third reason that this FACS technology shouldn't be implented is for privacy. While the author does list some useful applications for this technology, such as surgeries and video games, common computers for everday use is not where it should be used. One reason that people fear this advanced technology in their own computers is for privacy. Many students probably don't want a camera in their school laptops constantly scanning their faces to see what kind of emotions they have. Many students would see that as creepy and intrusive, and would probably complain to the adminstration to remove it.

People value many things in life, but some of the most important are their money, a good education, and and their privacy. Having this FACS technology in schools can ruin all of these things, which is why using this technology in a classroom is not valuable.          ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
A28E9B475935,"My mother always said, ""You will never learn if you stay at home, go to school to learn more things."" Math, English, history, and science are some classes that students needÂ to learn. If students take classes from home, then student will not learn so they will not benefit from it. Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes atÂ home because student will gain lessÂ exercise, students will get less social communication, and student will be less focus.

Many claim, students will benefit if they are able toÂ attend classes at home because they will feel more comparable. However,studentsÂ will not learn anything even if they feel more comparable at home. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home.

To begin, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes atÂ home because students will gain less exercise. For example, Generic_Name, whoÂ attend classes at home before, said that he will get less exercise, now that he goes to school he gets more exercise than before. To further detail, two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, both attend classes at home before, they would both say that they would gain very littleÂ exercise before going to school. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes atÂ home because students will gain less exercise.

Additionally,students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. For example,

Generic_Name, a girl who use to attend classes at home, would not communicate much with other students at first, after some time she is able to communicate with other students. To further detail, Generic_Name,Â would talk very little to other students because he use to take classes at home, after a while he would talk to other students. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication.

Lastly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will be less focus. For example, Generic_Name ,a student who attend classes at home, had to difficult time focusing on the lesson at home, some later she began to understand the lessons. To further detail, Generic_Name had a terrible time focusing on the lessons when he toke classes home, he said that his surroundingÂ was very distracting. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from at because student will be less focus.

To concluded, student will gain lessÂ exercise, have lessÂ communication experience, and will be less focus on lessons are reasons why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. These three argument state why students will not benefitÂ if they are able to attend classes from home. If students attend classes at home then student will not learn a home.

Then and working with a group is more beneficial. reasons being said are more people more ideas, getting help from teammates, and will be less mistake because there more than one person to get help. For example playing in a team sport working with teammates is better than trying to do every thing alone, same thing with a big project.

Just like the saying two heads are better than one. defiantly when working on a project. Being alone there going to be mistake because no one will correct you on the paper.

Not only that if a person is stuck on something the group with help out to solve it together, also it will save a lots of time trying to work by yourself.

Being in a team that the PE teacher assign you, will be hard trying to play alone in a group or team. Working by your self is not helping the team or people skills. In the long run getting a job there will be times when needed to work with co workers or bosses, doing group projects or playing for a team will benefit that. Because it helping on people skill. That learning in experience knowing not everybody is the same.

Working alone helps but I feel in a group is more beneficial. There no motivation being alone it attend to be boring. Therefor more mistakes could happen, limit to some ideas and knowledge, and can't get help because every one is working alone. Doing work in a group helps students be wake, reasons for that is there someone to talk to also it will be less work and save good amount of time. Students attend to dose off or stress when it to much work on their hands.

In conclusion I prefer working in a group feel more beneficial then working alone. It will defiantly help in school if a student is doing a project or playing for a team. Also in the long run With jobs, family, neighbors, or starting a protest will help if being in a group.",0,original_moth,Task: Compare and contrast the benefits of working with a group to working alone.

It is help for to the world and if every one does it and can help earth but a lot of people don't have the time to do that some people have work or outside school activities and that can get in the way of doing community service. also the little free time that some people have they want to spend it on there self. Not on doing some thing that requires more work because than that person can get stressed out.

I think some people should do it like the people that don't really have any thing to do in there life, or the people that have a lot of free time. Because that will have them busy once in a wile. also doing can give you better mental health by you caring about things like the earth and wanting to help out with people.

Well going back to having the principle making kids have to do community service. I think that is not needed for kids because it will give them stress if they really don't want do it. And some kids that are bad that are forced to do this might make mess even more to try to feel cool because he is doing community service or he might knock down garbage cans and stuff like that.

If each student can give back a little bit of time out of their day or weekend, our society would be a nice and clean place to live in. If people didn't do community service, our society would be a dump. there would be trash every where. It wouldn't be safe for children and baby's.

Or the students could help at a soup kitchen or tutor younger children in elementary school. It would be better for the younger children so they can get a better education and succeed. At the soup kitchen, students could serve meals to homeless people and the less fortunate.

In my conclusion, I think it would be best if it was required to perform community service. Everyone would feel better about themselves if they helped the community.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
B6B85CE5C8F5," When it comes to trying to be someone, is it better to improvise or follow the script all the time?

It's important to be true to yourself and embrace your unique qualities, rather than trying to fit into someone else's mold. By doing so, you learn more about yourself and develop your own individuality. Additionally, by acknowledging different methods for self-improvement, you can make a positive impact on others and inspire them to find their own path.

When you learn more about yourself, you discover new aspects of your personality and abilities that you may not have been aware of before. For example, one day you may decide to try a new hobby or activity that you've never done before. As you immerse yourself in this new experience, you may find that you have a natural talent or affinity for it. You may also discover new interests or passions that you never knew you had. This process of self-discovery is an essential part of personal growth and development.

By acknowledging different methods for self-improvement, you show that you are willing to put in the effort to become a better version of yourself. This may involve seeking out advice or guidance from others, or taking risks and stepping outside of your comfort zone. For example, if you're looking to improve your public speaking skills, you may take a public speaking course or join a local Toastmasters club. By embracing these opportunities, you can gain valuable feedback and support from others, as well as develop your own unique style and approach to public speaking.

It's important to remember that being true to yourself doesn't mean that you can't learn from others or draw inspiration from their experiences. In fact, by seeking out mentors or role models who have achieved success in areas that interest you, you can gain valuable insights and guidance that can help you on your own journey. However, it's important to approach these relationships with an open mind and a willingness to learn and grow, rather than simply trying to replicate someone else's success.

In conclusion, being true to yourself and embracing your unique qualities is essential for personal growth and development. By acknowledging different methods for self-improvement, you can make a positive impact on others and inspire them to find their own path. Whether you choose to improvise or follow a script, the most important thing",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

93F44C7E955A,"The Facial Action Coding System is a coding program that can read emotions, some say this could help in the classroom to tell if students are ingaged in the lesson. This system was created by Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe, leaders in their fields of expertise.

The usage of the Facial Action Coding System in schools to determine if a student is getting bored, tired, or angry at a lesson could be very useful. If a student were to get angry or bored during a lesson they are more likely to not pay attention and if you are tired you may not retain the information as well. If your computer could sense this and alert the teacher or change the lesson accordingly then it would give students a better working enviroment and a better chance of doing well in school. This 3D construct could also help teacher's understand their students better and help them learn more efficiently. This can also see through a fake smile and know the students real emotions which is important in case the student is trying to fake it through the leason when they really need help. According the the professional Dr. Huang, he predicts that, ""A classroom somputor could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then is would modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

So in conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can read emotions and see the real emotions present. This could lead ot improvements in the classroom so that teachers and the computor can alter the lesson as needed to the specfic student and their needs. This is a good idea because it will improve the work enviroment created for students. ",0,persuade_corpus,,8

27C714014E17,"Sometime staying home from school can feel great; It gives you time to fully wake up and enjoy your morning. Going to school can feel tiring because you do it 5 days a week. Some students would say they would rather stay home than actually coming, or maybe even working from home is better then being in school. Mostly because classes could be boring, you barely learn, or hard to focus on with all distractions in the room. Most schools allow you to work online and video conference with teachers for work. This could benefit you in many ways. Attending classes from home could help provide extra help and fitting doing your work into the day, improve knowledge, or being able to focus more in a quiet environment.

You ever needed extra help in a class but the teacher was too busy to assist you cause they're working with others. A video conference call would help that a one on one call, or class conference. More time for repeated instructions and more time to work on problems than rushing through them. Being able to record the call for later references on work and being able to not be distracted by friends. Fitting your work into your day meaning your able to work in the morning or midday. Manages time for your online school classes cause it could be at the same time everyday. You would still be learning the same thing as everyone else just a little different cause your home.

Benefits you by improving your knowledge. Makes you learn faster by understanding the information. Lots of online help meaning more websites to figure out how to do the work. Better ways of spending your time then to sit in a classroom and just talk to others and barely get work done. It would grab the attention of students because being on the computers could be fun and depending on the lesson it could be something for them to engage in and want to learn more. That makes students do their work more, when its more fun. A quiet place gives you your space that is needed to work and an calm environment. Gets you more focus because everything could be heard better without over talking.

Some disadvantages about taking classes from home would be the same for being in school taking classes. Like you would need to turn work in on time for proper grading, the connection for your computer could go out or be messed up, or even it would be hard to learn or wouldn't feel the same asÂ being in a class. Despite my reason taking classes at home are bad it's still a good thing that could benefit you in the end. It still has it ways of being challenging. Whos's to say it has to be easy to get better at it. The more you conference the better you get at asking for help and interacting with others, such as the teacher. Also multiply ways of getting it done and strategies.

Taking your classes at home would be the best benefit here. Basically you could take your time for work help understand things. Improve how much you get to sleep rather than to wake up early in the day. More space and quiet time to listen and learn. Students would say working at home is better than being at school. Although our friends would be there at school and we would be at home it still helps us get what we need done finished.

Who or what created this ""face"" on Mars? Was it aliens, or just nature doing its thing? The answer has been debated ever since it was discovered and the truth has been found. Although there's proof out there like the picture that was taken ten times better than the Viking's pictures, skilled scientist themselves don't even think it could be made by aliens, and there are similar landforms on Earth some people still find ways to argue. These people might say ""the markings were hidden under the haze, but just as much as that could be true it could also be wrong. This ""face"" was created by none other than Mother Nature herself.

To start, the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001 were much clearer than the original Viking pictures and unmask the face for what it really is. In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it states, ""...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos."" To illistrate, the article is saying that this new picture was so much better and much more revealing. The day this picture was taken (April 5, 1998) was completely cloudless. This means that there couldn't have been any alien markings hidden somewhere. Garvin said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size..."" He's hinting that even small things that show us there was civilization there could've been seen in this picture. To conclude, the new picture was proof to the world that this was just a landform.

Not only did a picture tell us this was no sign of alien life on Mars, but so did skilled scientists. When the picture was first taken, ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" We all know that scientists know their stuff so why doubt them? Their first intsinct was that it was just another landform, so why can't we all just agree with them and get on with our lives to worry about something more important? Even the caption for the picture (when it was released for everyone to see) noted that it was just a huge rock formation. So why can't we just see this ""face"" for what it is?

Lastly, there are landforms on Earth just like it. They're called mesas or buttes. Garvin says that "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of Mars."" If these landforms can naturally occur on Earth can't they also occur on Mars? Garvin sees that this landform is just like something we have at our own home.

Some people might say that when the picture was taken of the ""face"" in 1998 that it was probably cloudy that day and some alien markings were probably just covered up by the clouds. They must have done a lot of research because normally April is a cloudy time on the Red Planet, but that day was completely clear and ""sunny"". These people might just be the kind who believe in the supernatural and say that they've been ""obducted by aliens"". There is much more proof to this face being a natural landform compared to it being a alien made landmark. Where one side would say that ""scientists don't believe there is a chance of this"" the other side would say it was cloudy the day that picture was taken. Overall, there is no excuse for the fact that this is naturally occuring.

All in all, this face is a natural landform that has nothing to do with extra terrestrial life on Mars. There is proof behind it like the picture taken in 1998, the fact that actual scientists don't think there's any chance of it being alien related, and there are landforms like this one on Earth called a butte or mesa. All of these things proove that not only was ""the Face of Mars"" just a natural forming landform. Will you know the real cause of something like ""The Face of Mars"" next time you see one?

A3AF3030682D,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it would be nice to be able to bring our phones to school and only use them at lunch or any other free time we have. We should be able to have the phones on in school just not aloud to have them on where you could hear it. But, having the phones in school and being able to use them whenever we have a free period is a good idea. I think this policy is better because what if someone or a family member has to tell you something very important.

I mean sometimes parents don't like to call because they know they student is in school so they'd rather text them. Instead of calling them because maybe they don't want they news broadcasted on the intercom. I don't think having the students not bring their phones to school is a good solution. Either way you put it they are going to bring their phone , or whatever else technology they have.

So I think letting the students be able to bring their phones is a good solution , because you are letting them use it at a certain time of the day maybe more because students may have a free period twice a day. Well all I'm saying is that you should take a good look into letting students bring there phone to school at least they wouldn't have they phone out only the time there aloud to use it. Like when you see teachers on there phone it's like oh ok i could use my phone to. But when they see the student use there phone it's a problem. i don't find that to be fair.

The other policy I personally believe is not a good solution , because either you put it students are going to bring there phone. You will see there phone out more than ever. And if you ask for it you wouldn't get it. They going to ignore you and act like they can't hear you with all the music they are listening to.

A81E2C81BCAB," In my opinion, Albert Einstein's statement, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge,"" is a valid perspective. Imagination is a powerful tool that allows us to envision possibilities and create new ideas. Unlike knowledge, which is acquired through education and experience, imagination is entirely unique to each individual and is under their complete control.

I agree with Einstein's quote because, while knowledge is essential for success in any field, it is imagination that enables us to see beyond the present and imagine a better future. Imagination is the driving force behind innovation and progress, and it is what sets apart successful individuals from those who struggle to achieve their goals.

Einstein himself was a prime example of the importance of imagination. His groundbreaking theories in physics were born out of his ability to envision new possibilities and challenge traditional ways of thinking. It was his imagination that allowed him to see beyond the limitations of his time and make discoveries that continue to shape our understanding of the universe.

In addition to its role in innovation, imagination also plays a crucial role in personal growth and development. By imagining what we want to achieve and the obstacles we may face, we can prepare ourselves mentally and emotionally for the challenges ahead. Imagination also allows us to learn from our mistakes and improve upon our past experiences.

While knowledge is essential for success, it is imagination that truly sets apart those who achieve greatness. As Einstein himself said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" By harnessing the power of imagination, we can unlock our full potential and create a brighter future for ourselves and the world around us.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

895FFC078777," The idea that we should always do something rather than waiting for things to happen is one that has been echoed by many successful individuals throughout history. This mindset can be seen in the way that entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs went about building their businesses. They didn't wait for opportunities to come to them, but instead actively sought them out and worked tirelessly to make them a reality.

This approach to life has many benefits. For one, it helps to reduce stress and anxiety. When we have a clear plan and are actively working towards our goals, we don't have to worry about what might happen if we don't take action. Additionally, doing something can lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, which can be incredibly motivating.

Of course, it's important to remember that not all tasks are equally important or urgent. We need to be able to prioritize our work and focus on the things that are most pressing. However, even in cases where we may not have immediate deadlines, it's still beneficial to take action and make progress towards our goals.

Using video imagery the new emotion- recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painting face of Mona Lisa. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day.

DBC60BDBC49E,The school board shouldn't add one and half hours to school each day. To begin one reason i think they shouldn't is that a lot of kids who play sports or clubs after school might not be able to because they don't have time to learn about how life is and how difficult it is and people's life difficulties. One example is that some kids play videos and since they dont have lots of time out side of school they might just play video game instead of sports and if you give them more time out of school more opportunities students will have. secondly Students will be more tired and less focus because if students have more time in school the more earlier they will have to sleep and most students don't fall asleep early also students have homework since they well most likely be tired from school they might take a nap and there might either wake up to late to do homework or not have time to finish all there homework. Thirdly more students will not want to be in school and may drop out from either too much stress or they just don't want to be in school because the longer time there in school the more tired they are and less time they have to do what makes them feel relaxed or not have time to do what they love to do. students also might not have time to make friends because there focusing on school and it might ruin there social skill and conversation with strangers out side of school. Lastly less amount of time they have to spend with there families because they would have to go to school for extra time and as soon as they get home they have to do homework and honestly by the time there done there going to be most likely tired to do anything beside resting or sleeping. Also some students have younger siblings to take care of after school so that would put more stress on a student and either a family would have to pay for a baby sitter or some families don't have money to pay for one so parents might take there student out of school just to take care of there sibling and so the extra time in school wouldn't help him.

A2EF5BCC488B," Some individuals believe that when they master something they've never mastered before, they will grow as individuals. This notion is echoed by author Ralph Waldo Emerson in his quote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.""

For example, consider the development of a child. As they learn to walk, they will then move on to talking, and from there, they will continue to grow into toddlers, learning about letters, numbers, sharing, and easy words to pronounce. As they progress to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing. Eventually, as they grow into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills, reading, and even apply for jobs. Similarly, when I began my journey in automotive technology, I was initially intimidated by the tools I would need to use, such as wrenches, ratchets, and safety equipment. However, through continuous practice, I have become an expert in using these tools.

Another reason why Emerson's quote holds true is that if you continue to practice at something you've never excelled at, you will eventually excel at it. This sense of accomplishment will bring joy to the individual. For instance, when I was in elementary school, I used to eat a lot, but my family was impressed by my ability to finish almost everything on my plate. As a result, I grew taller than most of my family members, and this continues to be true today. Additionally, in elementary school, I learned the basics of mathematics, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. While it was challenging at first, I persisted in my studies, and now I am able to excel in this area.

However, it's important to note that if individuals continue to practice something challenging but do not seem to achieve it, they may feel upset and defeated. To remedy this, it's crucial to keep practicing and not give up. Emerson himself said, ""If you try your best or master at something you've never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it."" By continuing to practice, individuals will most likely achieve their goals and feel a sense of accomplishment.

In conclusion, Emerson's quote holds true that if individuals try to do something beyond what",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

But, not only was he taking care of the people and helping them, he was also helping the animals. I think he also liked taking care of the animals himself.

When people think of a Cowboy, they see someone wearing cowboy boots and riding a horse.

They also see a farm with a whole bunch of animals.

If someone is a cowboy, they normally like animals and taking care of them.

Like also liked the trips coming back. They played baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that also helped pass the time.

You also got to visit unique places.

Luke got to go to Greece, China, and even toured an excavated castle in Crete.

He also marveled at the Panama Canal, during his trip to China.

Since Luke didn't just go once, he must have enjoyed going on the trips and helping people.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy can open up a new world to you. Not only does it let you visit new and unique places, you get to help animals and people that are in need of it.

It sure was like that to luke.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
453771E00335,"When people ask for advice, typically 90% of them ask for multiple answers. Multiple answers is better than just one piece of advice. Because one piece of advice Is not enough to wrap your mind around it may be good advice but It just doesn't sink in. If you get multiple pieces of advice It sinks into your mind better because you have multiple things to think about instead of just one. Multiple pieces of advice is the best because It gives you more options, It gives you better options, and It just penetrates into your mind better.

First, multiple pieces of advice Is just out of the park better because It gives you more options. It gives you more opinions, because lets say you went to your uncle and he said something about what you should do, then you went to your dad and he said something different on what you should do. You have to different opinions on what you should do. Those two different opinions could be worded differently but they could mean the same thing. You could just like one more than the other because of how It's worded differently. That's why It's good to have multiple opinions because you might like one more.

Then, It gives you better options. Lets say you went out with your friends and you told them to give you ideas on how to ask the girl you like out. You asked one of your friends and he said something incredibly unwise, then you asked your other friends and they said something the complete opposite and It was a good idea. You went with the better option because you don't want to mess It up and not be able to date her. That's why It's important to have multiple answers because you want to have the best option possible.

Lastly, you want to have the best option sunken into your head. When an option Is stuck in your head you are less likely to forget It. Here's and example say you played the same song over and over for one week, even though you didn't listen to that song for another two weeks you will still most likely remember it because you listened to it over and over. Now that song is stuck in your head and you wont forget It. That's why It's good to get things stuck In your head so you dont forget them.

Typically 90% of people ask for multiple options of advice. This Is the best because you have more options, you get better options, and It penetrates into your head. Because of these the best option Is to ask for multiple pieces of advice because you don't want to end up forgetting anything or messing up.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

We have become so very dependent on our cell phones and always being connected that we cannot seem to put them down.

We sit down at the dinner table and do not talk with our families but our ""friends"" on social media. Not being able to separate our connection with our phones, laptops, tablets, etc. is potentially hurting us by never being able to step away from our devices. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. According to www. edgarsynder. com ""Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds.

a30c3204,"Dear Mr. Senator, Freedom to vote for authority figures in America had been an ideal image of government all across the world. However, is our privilege to vote really honest and are the results of elections really in our hands like we think they are? The Electoral College System undoubtedly should be abolished because Americans have the right to have full control over who is elected President and, although some may believe that Electoral Colleges avoid the occurrence of a runoff election, runoff elections may be avoided with much more reasonable methods.

Clearly, election should be determined by popular vote, and not the Electoral College because Americans earned their right to have full control over the representatives in their government. According to Source 2, ""state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people."" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selection of people to make the final decision of millions Source 1. The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to allude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions?

Unquestionably, the Electoral College is not a sound system for presidential election in the United States. In Source 3, Posner states that when there is an unclear plurality in the results of an election, the Electoral College makes it much simpler and more efficient by reducing the number of voters, eliminating the inconvenience factor. This statement appears as a faulty reasoning to have an Electoral College because it is absurd to remove americans right to vote. Maybe, rather than restricting our rights, the result of a runoff election could be resolved by an Electoral College, but the initial vote should be made only by the citizens, fairly. Depending on the defenders to make the final decision of the leaders of our great country is an overlycautious effort to avoid a tie, which could be easily resolved.

You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutionalright to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcomePlumer 13, 14. Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider. Thank you.",0,train_essays,,6
1FAD2EA2E1C7,"Dear Florida State Senator,

I personally believe that the electoral college should be abolished. It can be unfair to the people. At most, there could be a tie between the electoral votes,Â causing the people to wonder and worry who will become president. Lastly, the candidates of the electoral college simply do not spend any timeÂ in the state that they know haveÂ no chance of winning. Three reasons that IÂ believe the electoral college should be abolished are the following: the idea of having the electoral college is simply unfair to the people, many people worry that there will be a tie in the vote, and candidates do not spendÂ any time in the stateÂ that they know will not win.

The electoral college is simply unfair to the people.Â Over sixty percent of voters would rather have a direct election. Instead of getting to vote for president, you have to vote for the electors who get to vote directly for you. To make it even worse, the senator's vote could change at any time. ThisÂ often leavesÂ people not wanting to vote again.

Another major problem with this idea is that there could possibly be a tie.Â Then, the election would be given to theÂ House of Representatives. Now, state delegations wouldÂ have to vote. Because of all the complications that this would leave, the people may not not get who they vote for. The election can always change with just a few votes.

Lastly, the candidates that the people vote for do not spend any time in the states that know will not win. The candidates only focus on the ones that they think will.Â During one election in 2000, seventeen states were not visited by the candidates. Even some of the states withÂ the largest media markets did not see their candidates.

In conclusion, IÂ believe that the electoreal college should be abolished. It is simply unfair to to the people. It can cause problems such as there being a tie in the vote. Lastly, the candidates do spend any time whatsoever in the states with no chance of winning. The three reasonds why IÂ believe the electoral vote should be abolished are the folowing: it is unfair to the people, it can cause problems in the vote, and the candidates spendÂ no time in the states with no chance of winning.

64FD220F0DF7,"Emotions are a vital part of human life. Although they are sometimes overlooked or seem to not be present simply by looking at someone's face, they are used every day. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" introduces information regarding a technology which is able to detect the most common emotions. While this invention is widely seen as incredible, if not revolutionary, the Facial Action Coding System's presence is not valuable in classrooms.

The Facial Action Coding System does not have much value when it comes to using this technology to read students' emotinal expressions. The technology itself, while advanced in certain ways, is not that much more effective than a teacher's or students's abiltiy to distinguish feelings. The author, in his article presenting the many positives of this technology, addresses the idea that the system is able, from a 3D model it has built, to analyze the msucles of the face, matching their activity to certain basic emotions. The technology's ability to recognize emotions based on facial features and human behavior is something that humans have been doing automatically for centuries. The specific muscle structure is not necessary to determining one's feelings, as their use show noticeable changes on the face and are visible to the naked eye. Although this might be quicker, the technology would not have much value for classroom situations, as teachers could easily, while paying more attention to their students, notice the same details, identify changes in emotion, and alter their ways of teaching accordingly. Overall, the human's ability to identify basic emotional expressions would render this technology rather unvaluable in classrooms.

Similarly, the purely scientific origin of the Facial Action Coding System decreases the value this technological innovation would have for students in a classroom. While it might be successful in identifying the emotions of students, the Facial Action Coding System relies purely on the muscle behavior and structure, as mentioned in the article, meaning that no other factors would be taken into consideration. Many factors other than emotion, such as fatigue, can alter a student's appearance or behavior. The coding system would most likely, as a result of these underlying factors, as well as the very limited amount of emotions it can perceive, make the technolgy unvaluable when comes times to read student's emotional expressions. The generalization of emotions detected would produce false or unaccurate results, rendering the program useless in classrooms. The Facial Action Coding System, due to its computerized nature and lack of human perception, would not be a valuable addition to classrooms.

The lack of privacy this new technology brings makes the invention unvaluable. While some may think this to be a good way to improve student's lives throughout the school day, this facial recognition would raise many questions and controversy regarding student privacy. As the author states in the article, the Facial Action Coding System could be implemented in computers with the purpose of regulating ads and personalizing them to someone's preferences, likes, and dislikes. This is not only unnecessary, but would mean having a constant stream of visual information regarding students being sorted and analyzed. If this were implemented in classrooms, a number of parents and students alike would find this to be an intrusion of privacy, resulting in complaints, debates and overall unnecessary problems added to the education system. While this innovation might be somewhat useful or bring more attention to student's feelings, the excessive problems and controversy it would create makes the student emotional expression detector technology unvaluable and not a good addition to school.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The technology, although it could properly analyze the muscles and facial structure of students in classrooms, could easily be matched by a teacher, does not take in all possible factors, and would conjure up many questions regarding privacy in schools. While this program would have little to no value in classes, it could provide help to investigative work. Emotions are extremely versatile and human expressions, although they share some similarities, widely vary based off of each person and circumstance.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
113000585851,"Dear Senator,

There has beeen some recent heat on the topic of the Electoral College. I believe that it is only fair to keep the Electoral College. Although some voters may be upset with the fact that they don't define who wins the presidential election, it is best that way. If there was no Electoral College people with no actual idea of whats going on would vote, and that could have a negative affect. Also if there was no Electoral College there would be an unfair amount of votes in larger states. The last reason is Swing States, which is also a very important part of the voting process.

First and Foremost, the Electoral College may make voters feel like they have no input on the election, but really they decide who the Electoral voters choose. Without Electoral voters, there would be indecisive people voting for a candidate they know nothing about. For example, many young voters base their votes off of popular opinion, not what they think is actually right. If there was no Electoral College, the Nation could be in a lot of trouble because many votes would be casted off of popular opinion. So it is good to have some control over what happens and who becomes president, but I think having the full decision to vote for whomever, and have it count, is overdoing it.

Secondly, I believe that having the Electoral College is great because, without it larger states would have more of a say on who becomes president. This would be very unfair to the smaller states for an obvious reason, population. Even though a few states might have a bigger population that doesn't particularly mean that everyone in the state will vote. There are still ""independent voters"". For example, as stated in paragraph twenty-one, the election voting in Florida was very close and relied a lot on popular votes. Florida ended up getting twenty-nine electoral votes, compared to Wyoming who only got three electoral votes. State size does matter because larger states will typically always get more attention from the presidential candidates than smalller ones.

Lastly, The Electoral College is a very important part of our voting process becaue of Swing States. As stated in paragraph twenty, voters in toss-up states are ""more likely to listen to the campaign and the competing candidates"". These voters know that their votes wont make much of an impression on the election, but pay the most attention anyways. People claim that the most involved voters should be able to decide the elections. Although they don't have much of a say it is nice to know that people do care about the elections and do pay close attention to what is going on.

To conclude my previously stated reasons, I believe that having the Electoral College is a crucial part of the system. Because without it the nation would have so many voters that only cast their votes based off of popular opinion. Also without it larger states would have more of an affect on the votes than the smaller states do. Finally, Swing States are a very important part of voting because voters who know what is going on and actually pay attention do have one of the biggest affects.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
D92E4A5DAA55,"Have you ever struggled in a certain activity, or just wanted to join a new club.

Many students often feel that way and don't know what to do, but there are many after school clubs that help out in that regard. Students who are struggling in certain subject could stay after school with a teacher to help in that situation. Many schools also provide sport clubs so that students interested would join, and possible lend them a scholarship into collage. Students who participate in extracurricular activities are more likely to make stronger bonds with others. With so many benefits to staying after school, I believe that students should stay after school in at least one club.

There are many instances in which students struggle to keep high grades up, and don't know what to do. There are many extracurricular activities that may help in that scenario. Students can find clubs in which they can get help by teachers to do work there struggling to finish.

If a student missed a day of school and can't catch up, teachers can stay after and show them and important information that they missed. Tests can bring stress to students , and even make them panic a little, when that happens students can request thatÂ teacher help them and even give tips on how to relax and focus. Trying to juggle so many things at once can be difficult for most students, but teachers are there to help out those in need.

Sport clubs are one of the most popular clubs in some schools, and for good reason. Clubs like these offer students a chance to play the sport they like and represent the school at the same time. Sport clubs also give participantsÂ the opportunity to hang out with friends and create new ones along the way. In some rare chances collages may offer them a fully paid scholarship if they see the student overall success, and while it even rarer some professionals may be interested and ask them to join there team. Sports clubs offer students many opportunitiesÂ to get a head start in life and even get them interested in new hobbies.

Students coming to a new school for the first time might be timid or feel alone during the first few day, so why not ask them to come to after school. Extracurricular activities offer new students the change to make new friends and even help strengthen old ones. Many group of friends often hang out after school to just hang out or relax from the stressful day. Many clubs also relate to specific peoples interest, so people can meet others who are interested in their hobbies. Every person is unique and some may struggle to make new bonds, but after school activities can help them meet people who share the same hobbies or help steanthen bonds

After school clubs are some of the key factors in schools. They help them keep high grades, Gives students the chance to do there hobbies like sport, and may even help new kids to make bonds or steanthen them.

EB5924FBD25C,"As an 8th grader, I believe that extending the school day by two hours can have numerous benefits for both students and teachers. Firstly, it can provide more time for students to learn and engage in extracurricular activities, which can help them develop their interests and passions outside of the classroom. For example, students could use the extra time to join a sports team, club, or volunteer in their community, which can help them develop important life skills and character traits.

Additionally, an extended school day can provide more time for teachers to deliver high-quality instruction and provide individualized support to students who need it. This can help to bridge the achievement gap between students and ensure that all students have access to the education they deserve. Furthermore, an extended school day can provide more time for teachers to collaborate and plan together, which can lead to more effective teaching strategies and better student outcomes.

However, there are also some drawbacks to consider. Some students may have work or other commitments after school, which can make it difficult for them to attend an extended school day. This can lead to conflicts and stress for these students, which can negatively impact their academic performance. Additionally, some teachers may struggle to balance their workload and personal life with an extended school day, which can lead to burnout and decreased motivation.

One potential solution to this issue is to add an extra school subject for students. For example, students could have the option to take a class in a subject area that they are particularly interested in, such as coding, art, or music. This can provide students with more opportunities to explore their interests and develop their passions, while also providing them with additional academic support and challenge.

In terms of the educational benefits of adding an extra hour to each school subject or an extra school subject for students, there are several potential advantages. For example, adding an extra hour to each subject can provide students with more time to practice and apply what they have learned in the classroom, which can help to reinforce their understanding and improve their retention of the material.

The students have a chance to be creative and have fun with the project. It gives them an opportunity to pick something they really love learning about and it helps the teacher get to know them better.

They're most likely to put a lot more effort into the project. For example, you were just assigned a project and the topic on it was something you absolutely hated you're not going to want to do the project or put much effort in it and you're going to get bored with it.

As the article explains, Venus may also hold clues about Earth's early history and even the possibility of primitive life. These are questions that could reshape our understanding of planetary science.

Moreover, the author notes that studying Venus allows us to push the boundaries of engineering. Enduring the brutal Venusian environment requires developing ever more robust probes, heat shields, and mechanisms able to function under intense pressure and heat for lengthy periods. Such technologies could enable hardier satellites, space stations, and even human missions to more extreme environments elsewhere in the solar system. Each exploration of Venus thus furthers not just our scientific knowledge but our ability to explore some of astronomy's deepest mysteries.

While the hazards cannot be overlooked or underestimated, the potential benefits of Venus exploration according to this article justify continued efforts to overcome these immense challenges. The scientific questions it could answer and engineering capabilities it could foster make studying Venus a profoundly worthy pursuit that promises remarkable rewards, as the author successfully argues. Venus may not be hospitable to life today, but it offers humankind an immense laboratory to expand our understanding of planetary processes and push the limits of discovery.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,4
665A2D50F034,"If you needed somebody's advice and you ask multiple people how do you think that would give you a better choice? Some people like to ask one person for advice but its good to ask multiple. One of my friends got in trouble and he aid you are the only one I asked for help and I said ask more people so you can get more opinions. And everyday sence then i been asking multiple for there opinions. I think that multiple opinions is good because, it makes us think about it, the people that we asked could tell the out come, it helps us do the right thing.

The way I think that getting multiple opinions helps us think is. When you go home you spend time on trying to fix it and you think about all the advice you get. And when you think about all the advice it make you want to do some of it. What I do when I know i'm going to get in trouble I ask people what I should do and when they tell me i do the right thing. Thinking about what the people said helps me get all the stress of my mind so I can say what happen and don't get in trouble.

When I ask the people for advice I also ask what was the out come and they tell me. Asking for the out come can help to because it lets you know that they did the right thing so I can too. Knowing the right or wrong thing to do is good but I feel like asking for the out come is better. Would you rather know the out come or know that its right. Its a lot of advice you can ask for and getting the out come is going to make the advice better.

When getting advice it help us do the right thing. Like one time I asked for advice it was good and it help me do the right thing. My friend once told me some good advice and I used it and it help me do the right thing. Doing the right thing help doing good in life and if ypu don't do the right thing you would proubly have a ok life. All of the advice

I get I use it so I can have the best life ever.

I think that multiple opinions is good because, it makes us think about it, the people that we asked could tell the out come, it helps us do the right thing. Thinking about what the people told you give me a lot of self control. When I ask for advice I ask for the out come so I know if its the right thing to do or the bad. I think that asking for advice is the best thing to do it helps us do the right thing. How do you think getting advice from multiple people help us make a better choice.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
DEC50B420484,"Working with a group versus working alone has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. While some people prefer to work alone, others find group work to be more beneficial. In this essay, we will compare and contrast the benefits of working with a group versus working alone.

One of the biggest benefits of working with a group is the ability to share ideas and perspectives. When working with a group, individuals can bounce ideas off each other and get feedback on their work. This can lead to more creative and innovative solutions to problems. Additionally, group work can help individuals learn from their peers and gain a different perspective on a topic.

Another benefit of working with a group is the ability to divide and conquer tasks. When working on a group project, individuals can take on different tasks and responsibilities, which can help to speed up the process. This can also help to ensure that all aspects of the project are covered.

On the other hand, working alone has its own set of benefits. One of the biggest benefits is the ability to focus solely on the task at hand. When working alone, individuals can work at their own pace and without distractions. This can lead to more efficient and effective work. Additionally, working alone can help individuals to develop their own ideas and perspectives without the influence of others.

Another benefit of working alone is the ability to take ownership of the work. When working alone, individuals are solely responsible for their work, which can help to develop a sense of pride and ownership. This can also help to motivate individuals to work harder and produce higher quality work.

In conclusion, working with a group and working alone both have their own set of benefits. Working with a group can lead to more creative and innovative solutions, as well as the ability to divide and conquer tasks. Working alone can lead to more efficient and effective work, as well as the ability to take ownership of the work. Ultimately, the choice between working with a group and working alone will depend on the individual and the task at hand.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,6
1EAC5810BA06,"""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""(1) This process where a selection of electors meet and vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes in Congress is a way of election that has been in the roots of this great and prosperous country since its begining. Is this way of electing really all that fair? Does it let the entire population get a fair say in who thay want to run the country? While some people may argue that this system allows the people on the commity of electors that actually want to have their fair say in who becomes president, but first you need to think about; they whole american population barely has any say at all in the election and we change this tradadition.

It is time for a change, becuase when a United States citizen votes, they actually arent even voting for president at all. They are mearly voting for a commity of electors to elect the next president for them. Also, is the the commity of electors that actaully wins the elections, and not the popular vote. This is why they call this commity of electors the swing vote because you could win the poplular vote by 78.9 percent and still lose the election because you lost the commity of electors votes. This senerio has happened a few times in our history. For instance in 2000 canidate Al Gore won there popluar vote but lost the presidencey thanks to the commity of electons from the electoral college. Some people may argue that this is a long tradtion in our country and must be kept. Yes this is true, but there are some very crusial factors against this.

I understand that this election process was put forth but our founding father and some people do not want to just throw it away. While I understand this; however, there are flaws in this process that must not be over looked. It does not include and take into count the whole population and it can lead some canadits to lose even when the whole country voted for them. So we need to do something about this process of election. We must find a new way that included and takes into count the population of the United States. Not just a commity of electors.

The Elector College has been is the building blocks of this country since its begining, but becuase of some of it's flaws it must be changed. This process does not include the entire count of the votes by american citizens. It is like our thoughts and ideas of who should be president do not even matter in the votting process. The Electoral College may be a deep tradition in our country since its begining, it must be changed if our great nation is going to be able to prosper and grow.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
3DFB9606E5DE,"I am against the deselopement of driverless cars. Its great learning how to drive. Especially when some one you love is teaching you. It creates great times and memories for the both of you. I am against the developement of driverless cars because they can malfunction and become cause harm and because its good for people to learn things on their own.

Driverless cars can malfunction and become dangerous for the passengers in the car. They may seem great at first, but then what will happen if it breaks down or something spontanious happens that the car is not programmed to recognize? The world is very unpredictable. It would be good to have a human and alert pair of eyes on the road.

Its good for people to learn to drive on their own. Just like the text says, "" ...so far, Google cars aren't truely driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadblock or accidents."" Humans, or passengers, need to know how to do those things until that is programmed. Also learning to drive is a great way to bond with family members or a trusted lisenced adult. It creates memories. I know this from experience. When I turned 15 my mother wanted to teach me to drive. Our relationship was on the rocks around that time but her teaching me to drive only made us smile, laugh, and reminisse on me alonost killing us. Once i learned to drive I felt like i had accomplished something worth while. I felt I had purpose on the road. Thhats a great feeling.

Some may argue that driverless cars are a good thing and that they may be safer. That is true in some cases but not all. I believe driverless cars would be perfect for events and a large amount of passengers. For example, prom, a driverless limo would be perfect. There may be drinking involved that may be the safest way back for the promgoers, but what if theres a road block and all of the passengers are drunk? Then what?

I am against the deveopement of driverless cars because at times it can be very dangerous also its great learning to drive. Personally I love driving. Many other people do too. Also many other people are too young to drive and cant wait to learn. If technology does everything that child that dreams of getting behind the wheel of their dream car just has to watch as a passenger.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
93FD96ADB996,"Human emotions have been around about as long as humans have. For milenia humans have been able to convey feelings through facial expressions for many hundreds of years. Peole have also figured out ways to fake or force emotions if they feel it necessary and have been doing so for hundreds of years. While classrooms are newer but feel boring to most,they are a big part of life. Classrooms might be boring, and while it has become possible to use new technology to make learning fun, but this begs the question, is it practical?

Computers are newer and facial recognition is on the rise but is the facial recognition software fit for a classroom? Facial recognition software might be available,but as the article mentions,personal computers can't handle the software. How are schools supposed to use something that requires a larger computer with only a small amount of money to spend? The article also doesn't mention how costly the software itself is so it could be too costly for schools. Most schools simply do not have the kind of money required for this new technology.

The new software could be used to make lesson plans more fun but is that practical. Ignoring how the schools would get this new software,the practical use of it has a cost of its own. Changing lesson plans to be more fun may sound practical,but what about the cost and different types of learning? There are different types of learning,auditory,visual,hands on,and probably more types of learning,but how are schools supposed to cater to those who like to learn differently than the rest? The methods of putting these other types of learning into effect would be far too costly for most schools an would probably require even more software and other technology.

The costs of practical facial expression recognition software usage are big but ignoring that, will people accept a comuter watching their facial expressions? Though the article mentions about facial expressions and analyzing them, it fails to take into account how people feel about this. According to the article,this software could be used to tell if a student is bored,but would students be comfortable with a machine that could tell how they were feeling just watching them as it taught? Many students would feel uncomfortable being watched constantly especially by a computer that could analyze how they were feeling. Not to mention the fact that for some forms of learning the computer might be forced to move around with the help of other technology to give examples which might make students more uncomfortable.

In conclusion while facial reading software seems like a good idea,maybe it isn't. The software wouldn't be compatible with school computers. The cost of replacing the computers and putting the new and more fun learning techniques into practice would be very costly. Many students would feel uncomfortable with this new technology and some things students are forced to learn simply can't be made fun easily. While it might seem like a good idea on the surface,some things just aren't practical.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
darragh_claude_v7_538,"The Promise and Pitfalls of Driverless Cars

Driverless cars are set to revolutionize transportation, but several issues remain unresolved. While autonomous vehicles offer safety and accessibility benefits, technological and social challenges could prevent widespread adoption. On balance, a carefully regulated rollout of driverless cars merits support given their long-term potential. 

Undoubtedly, removing the human element from driving can reduce accident rates. Data indicates that over 90% of crashes stem from human error due to distraction, judgment lapses or other fallibilities. Driverless sensors and reflexes promise consistent alertness with no lapses in focus. This allows such vehicles to avoid rear-end collisions, swerves into other lanes and crashes due to drunkenness or drowsiness. Especially for the elderly and disabled, autonomous mobility can greatly expand independent living.

However, significant technological obstacles to full autonomy persist. Sensors struggle with convoluted traffic intersections, interpreting ambiguous situations and responding appropriately to anomalies. Software glitches could potentially cause accidents that algorithms were not programmed to anticipate. While technology continues advancing, overreliance on automation may outpace its actual capabilities in complex road conditions. Public acceptance may also lag behind engineering feasibility if people distrust autonomous decisions they cannot directly influence. 

Additional issues involve allocating moral responsibility during crashes that algorithms, not individuals, caused. Lack of consensus on prioritizing safety versus passenger preference further complicates regulatory and legal frameworks. For driverless cars to reach their potential, experts must resolve open questions around accountability, data protection and oversight in a transparent manner that reassures citizens. 

On balance, with prudent safeguards and managed expectations, autonomous vehicles offer transformative long-term economic and social impacts that justify continued pursuit via pilot projects and progressive legislation. Concerns over technology and responsibility are valid but surmountable through careful testing, collaborative standards-setting and public engagement. By incrementally expanding automation under comprehensive oversight, policymakers can maximize benefits while mitigating foreseeable challenges. Doing so responsibly could herald a future of cleaner, equitable and smarter transportation.",1,darragh_claude_v7,"In the article âDriverless Cars are Coming,â the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

3B0D96456EF0,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. It is not created by some aliens. If it is created by aliens, why is it the shape of human, instead of their leader, and why is it not detail enough? So I say that this ""Face on Mars"" is not created by aliens, but a natural landform.

Some of the scientists in NASA believed that the Face was created by the aliens, so went there and took the same picture again. The image shows that it is a natural land form and there was no alien monument. But not everyone was satisfied, because the picture was taken during a cloudy time. Then we went to Mars to look for the same thing again, and it came out good. The picture was clear and detailed. The 2001 picture show it is familiar to human shape but it is the shadow that makes it look more like a human mask.

There is a common landform on Earth that is similar to the face of human face. Though the human face landform is on Mars, that does not mean that aliens created it. We went to space for two more time to prove that it is not aliens' creation. The ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
250C23C66629,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author explains both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. The author talks about from what the driverless cars have in store from the areas the driverless cars need help on. In the end, I am more than sure I am against driverless cars.

One reason why I am against the making of these cars are that the word ""driverless"" in the word driverless car, isn't true. The car is not one hundred percent driverless. The car will alert the driver when needed assistance. Such as heavy traffic, construction zones, and accident scenes. The narrator states, ""In fact, none of these cars developed so far are completely driverless."" As you can see, the car doesn't live up to it's name.

Another reason why I wouldn't approve driverless cars are that they aren't as safe to a human being in control of wheel. Technolgy is not that advanced to where it doesn't have glitches and issues. It still do. Not saying us humans don't, but wouldn't you rather be in control insteading of trusting a certain thing that is not one hundred percent accurate? Even traffic laws stated that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not what the claim to be. Their not guarnteed driverless and they aren't safe. From not even being real to their name to having issues. I hope I won't see a driverless car on the road anytime to see.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
6CE97E45BF79," The past few decades have seen technology evolve at a rapid pace, making it possible for humans to achieve goals that were once thought unattainable. While some argue that technology has a negative impact on people's lives, the fact is that it helps to make communication easier and improves the overall quality of life for many individuals.

One of the main arguments against technology is that it encourages people to become more isolated and less social. Some experts have suggested that people spend more time on electronic devices than interacting with others face-to-face. According to a recent study, the average person spends at least 10 hours a day using social media and watching videos.

However, technology has made it possible for people to connect with others around the world, regardless of their location. For example, many people use video conferencing tools to communicate with family and friends who live far away. This has made it possible for people to maintain relationships that would have been impossible in the past.

In addition, technology has made it possible for people to work and complete tasks more efficiently. Online shopping, for example, has made it possible for people to purchase goods and services from the comfort of their own homes. This has saved people time and money, and has made it possible for them to focus on other aspects of their lives.

Overall, technology has had a positive impact on people's lives, making it easier for them to communicate with others and improve their overall quality of life. While it is true that technology can be isolating, it has also made it possible for people to connect with others in ways that were once impossible.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

Some school offer learning distance to attend classes from home, by online or a video conferencing. This is a good thing to students if they have health problems, can get a better sleeping schedule, and students will feel safer at home then school. But some people will say thatÂ staying home will make them lazier and not do the work, but that's not the case here. We want the students to focus on their goal and if this is the way then let it be.

There are a lot of kids that have health problem that need to be check every couple of hours or need to take pills every couple of hours a day, if not check they could be in trouble and send to the hostile. At home the parents can help them to remember to take there pills or do their daily check up at home or to the doctor office. Appointments is another problem that we all face and hate. There are times when you can't get the time you want, so you will not miss any school hours, that doesn't work all the time. But when you are taking online classes you don't need to worry about that, you can just take the class later that day or take your computer to the appointment since they take forever to finish and work on it there.

Sleep is very important to health, because it will make you feel ready to do stuff and help you focus on your work better. When you tell your kids to go to bed or your kids are old enough to go to bed all by them self, half the time they don't go to sleep right away. They might be on their phone all night or they have a sleeping problem that takes time to fall asleep. When this happens they don't want to get up in the morning, late or miss to the school bus and fall asleep in class. Taking online classes from home will let you pick the time you want to do the classes, so that you will have energy to finish them easierÂ and not past out ever second of the day.

What is the most important thing in the world, yourself, your life, your kids, or family? It can be anything, but when you are a mother or fatherÂ your kids safely is more important then your own. School should be a fun time, learning cool stuff you didn't even know about and a safe place to feel comfortable of being yourself, not being scared to go to school because another kid is bullying you, or a teacher is sexual to you. Parents will do anything to protect their kids. So when your kid is not feeling safe in school, the best thing the parent or kid will think about is take online school, if the problem at school is too much to deal with. They will feel more clam, comfortable and safer taking the online classes at home.

Therefore, those are the reasons why online classes are benefit for people that are too sick to go to school, a better sleeping schedule and most importantly being safe.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

A80542F83A7C,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. It would help the students who had a bad experience at school. Students who are in their comfort zone will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. Some may argue that student should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students that are at home will most likely be distracted, and will not finish their agenda. Some students will have a hard time teaching their selves. Also it would not give the students, the chance of experiencing what it is like in school.

It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. Every students grew up differently, and also some other students have had a bad childhood experienced and it reflected on how they act in their current life, by giving them a chance to study where they are comfortable at would give them a chance to show what they can really do, because not many students have that many option or chances to show their full potential. They can not do that by having to stay in school, and force them selves to socialize to other students or teachers it would all just be a distraction.

Also, it would help the students who had a bad experienced at school. Students who experienced getting bullied at school can caused them to stop going or the will to study and be successful in life. Bullying even nowadays still have so much impact on why some schools are really not on their high standards. And it showed that students are highly affected by it. It showed that it is a nightmare to some students, but now having the online classes will pull them away from that and really focused on their studies.

Furthermore, students who are in their comfort zone, will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. By having that comfortless and being in your zone of learning, will highly benefit you to show your potential. Being in the right environment also help students focused. Students who is really serious about being successful and have that high standards are more likely to be successful. Family can also motivate them, to keep on pushing even though it might be hard for them but having your family by your side can really motivate you to keep on pushing.

Therefore, i really believed that, students should really have the option to take online classes or video conferencing. by just having that it would benefit lots of student, who are having problems being socialize to other students or teachers. it would help the students who had a bad experience in school. And it also would benefit the students who are in their comfort zone, and being able to focused and having that chance would increase the chances of more students will be successful.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
AF9AAA672210,"When you go shopping or are picking something out you often ask for multiple peoples advice. Why do you do this? Well it's mostly because you want the reassurance from others. It is a natural thing that we all do. For instance last September my sister went homecoming dress shopping. She brought a bunch of people so we could all give our opinions. But at the end of the day does it really help? Well here is how it went and why I think multiple opinions help someone make a better choice.

The first person my sister asked for there opinion was our Grandma. After a while of my sister coming out in dresses the first thing I noticed was my Grandma always asking ""Well what do you think of it?"" before giving her opinion. I think this is a very good way to give your opinion without hurting any onesÂ feelings. You are asking how the feel about the dress before you put your thought in. But there are some disadvantages to that. Let's say she walks out of the dressing room in a dress my Grandma really doesn't like and she asked my sister how she feels about it and my sister says she loves it. Then you have a hard decision to make. Do you say you like it so you don't hurt her feelings or are you going to be honest and say you don't like it with the possibility of making her upset. Ultimately I know that even if I don't like to hear that they don't like it I would rather someone be honest with me then just lie and say they like it. And luckily that is what my Grandma did. And as a result even if that is not what my sister wanted to hear I could tell she was thankful for the honesty and took into consideration what my Grandma thought about the dresses.

The next opinion my sister asked for was my mom. I knew even before this trip started that my mom was going to have a very strong opinion on each dress. And I was not mistaken. Each dress came with a ""thats too short"" or ""that shape does not flatter you and the color is to bright."" I could easily tell this was overwhelming my sister and stressing her out a lot. And that is one reason why getting multiple opinions can be bad but again sometimes after my mom said that my sister would look in the mirror and realize well maybe it is too short. I think this is one thing that happens a lot. You will put on something you like and when you show it to someone they point out something you maybe didn't think about or realize. One example is when I was at Target one time and I picked out a shirt that I really liked and when I showed my mom she remembered that I already had that shirt. If she had not been there I would have never known that and I would have gotten the exact same shirt I already had. So even though my mom can be brutally honest at least she can point out a lot of things you didn't notice and help you pick the right dress at the end of the day.

The last opinion my sister got and the most important one was Beyonce. She has been a family friend for a while and my sister has always really loved her fashion sense. So when Beyonce heard that my sister needed to go dress shopping she was more then happy to come along. Her job was to help my sister pick out the dresses to try on and then give her opinion. Her way of giving her opinion was just to first point out all the things she liked about the dress and then something that my sister maybe want to consider. I think Beyonce was the best at giving her advice because she has to do it all the time with her music and what she wears for all of her performances. I think it can be very hard to get lots of opinionsÂ and not be overly influenced and not listen to your own opinion. So you have to makes sure even though you listen to everyone'sÂ advice you also listen to yourself and not just go along with whatÂ everyone says. But At the of all of this after Beyonce had given her final opinion and everyone had all agreed on a red dress that flared out at the bottom and had little white flowers. My mom agreed it wasn't too short and it was a nice color and my Grandma said it was absolutely beautiful and finally Beyonce said she was Grammy winning ready.

After this very long and tiring journey I came to the conclusion that ever opinion is important ans really can help you make the best decision. I would highly recommend getting an opinion from everyone you can but make sure that you listen to your own opinion too. It can be especially hard with really big decisions and so for those I would still get a lot of advice from others but also take time to consider each option and like about the pros and cons.Â    Â  Â  Â    Â  Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

EBCC0B6D36D0,"The Importance of Jobs and How Technology Affects Our Ability to Get and Perform Them

Jobs are an essential part of our lives. They provide us with a sense of purpose, a means of earning a living, and a way to contribute to society. However, the way we work and the types of jobs available to us have been greatly affected by technology. In this essay, I will explore the importance of jobs and how technology has impacted our ability to get and perform them.

First and foremost, jobs are important because they provide us with a sense of purpose and direction. When we have a job, we are able to focus our efforts and energy on a specific task or set of tasks. This sense of purpose can be incredibly fulfilling and can give us a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Additionally, jobs provide us with a means of earning a living. This is especially important for young people who are just starting out in the workforce and need to support themselves.

However, technology has also had a significant impact on the types of jobs available to us. Many jobs that were once done by humans are now being done by machines or automated systems. This has led to a decline in the number of jobs available in certain industries, such as manufacturing and transportation. At the same time, technology has also created new jobs in fields such as software development and data analysis.

One of the main benefits of technology in the workplace is increased efficiency. With the help of computers and other tools, we are able to complete tasks more quickly and accurately than ever before. This can lead to increased productivity and profitability for businesses, as well as more free time for workers to pursue other interests.

Another way that technology has affected our ability to get and perform jobs is through the rise of the gig economy.

3ee17c7f3d55_04112023,"Dear Principal, 

I am writing to you regarding the school's cell phone policy options of Policy 1 or Policy 2. After considering both options, I believe that Policy 1, which allows students to bring phones to school but requires them to be turned off during class time, is the better choice. Here are three reasons why:

First, having phones accessible during free periods like lunch allows students to stay connected with friends and family outside of school. Many students rely on their phones to coordinate after-school activities or communicate with working parents. As long as phones are turned off during academic time, they do not disrupt learning. 

Second, a total phone ban under Policy 2 may be difficult to enforce. Students determined to use their phones secretly would find ways to do so regardless of rules. Policy 1 establishes clear guidelines that are easier for both students and teachers to follow. Unexpected issues could be addressed immediately instead of becoming distractions.

Third, phones are a reality of modern life that students need to learn to manage appropriately. Policy 1 teaches students responsibility by allowing phones with restrictions. They learn balance between schoolwork and communication. A total ban may delay students' ability to integrate phone use into their daily lives productively. 

In summary, Policy 1 respects that phones are part of students' lives outside school while also protecting classroom learning time. It establishes a reasonable approach that considers students' needs and school priorities. For these reasons, I believe Policy 1 is the best cell phone policy option for our school. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your consideration.

4C5C238144A3,"The Electoral College has been used for years. I agree that we must keep it this way. Yes, It is possible that the outcome of the popular vote that the people have chosen is not in agreement but it has been the best way of selecting a President. It is highly unlikely that when the people vote for certain selection of the candidates group of electors will change their mind. It has happened before but It's rare. I suggest that the electoral college stay, and not change the election because It has not only been used for years, but also some of the citizens may make a mistake in who they vote for, and atleast with the Electoral College we can make sure we have the right President.

Each Candidate has their own electors and it take 270 of electoral votes to choose a President and since they are from the same group, they wouldn't choose someone else. It has happened in 2000, as it says in the excerpt. This system has been used for years, why change it now. The Electoral Collge has worked this way for years, the founding fathers came up with it as a good process. It is completely fair to all. The people get to select their candidate and the electors know what their responsibilities are. The citizens aren't completely able to control the electors ideas but they might have a bit more knowledge on the subject.

'Some citizens may get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate' excerpt from passge. This refers to the fact that we may have chaos if we let the people decide directly who is our President. We need an insider to review our peoples choices and make sure that it is the correct one, and what better way than to have the Electoral College do it. It depends on the state and the candiddate's political party, In which you chose. The People will get what they asked for, their has been times In which it that is not always the case, but the electors usually make the decision the people has asked for.

As said in the passage ""In defense of the Electoral Collage"", Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and the trust is rarely betrayed, This system is the best one yet. Our people are well informed but not always, If we take out the Electoral college, we are leaving our country in their hands and people make mistakes sometimes, with the electoral college we have various people making the right decision.

It's like when an author writes a book, they don't get it published right away, they have people to make sure their spelling is correct and they make many other different corrections. It's the same with the Electoral college and the way the president is selected. As my state senator, I suggest we keep this system.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
llama_70b_v1223,"Standardized testing is not a good measure of student ability. They are too much pressure on us students. We have to sit there for hours and answer questions that don't even relate to what we learn in class. It's not fair.

For example, last year I was taking a math test and I got a question wrong because I didn't understand the way the question was worded. It was a hard question and I knew the concept but I didn't know how to do it the way they wanted me to. It was frustrating.

Also, standardized tests don't take in account different learning styles. Some people learn better hands on, some people learn better visually, and some people learn better through listening. But standardized tests are mostly multiple choice and that's not fair to people who learn differently.

Another thing, standardized tests are too long. We have to sit there for hours and it's exhausting. It's hard to focus and it's hard to do your best when you're tired.

I think that teachers should be able to make their own test based on what we learned in class. That way, they can make sure that we understand the material and they can also see how we learn best.

36820FEFBDCA,"Dear Mr./Ms. Senator,

I think it would be a good idea to change the election by popular vote for election of our president. It would be a good idea for a few reasons. One it doesn't fully represent the people, (or general population.) For example, Persident Obama in the 2012 election only recieved 51.3% of the population vote. However because of the Electoral College, he was able to become the president of the United States. And us, the voters, well we aren't even voting for our president. According to source two,

The Indefensible Electoral College , "" Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" So us the people aren't even voting, do our votes really even count? Say i live in a state like Maine, then i only have 4 electoral votes, oppose to a big state like Texas, who according to the map in the third source have ""38 electoral votes"". My vote really doesnt even count. Because of the amount of votes your state gets in the upcoming election relys on the population. But every state only gets one final vote. so say Wyomming gets just as many votes as Texas, who represents 35 million voters. Do you see how this is unfair? And then theres the ""Disaster Factor"", This can destroy anyones chances at becoming president. It happened in the 60's it happened in the 2000 election, it can happen anytime. The Disaster factor is when repressentatives vote for whom ever they please. When this happened in the 60's rasists almost succeded in a plan to bump President Kennedy from the office. they were going to replace all the electors with different people to go up against Kennedy. The electors can bassically do what ever they please, considering we voted them in. They casn defy us as much as they please. In the 1968 election, just a mere 8 years after the would be catastropy of the segragationists, a tie, yes a tie, almost occured. It was about 10,000 votes away form a ""deadlock tie"". According to the second source, "" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" They basically told the swing voters to take it off their hands and vote for who they pleased. These are just a few of the reasons why The Electoral College is Outdated and needs the be repalced.

The concept that people choose their own paths in life is one that has been widely discussed for centuries. Many people believe that we are responsible for forming our futures, while others feel that our lives are determined by external factors. There are various elements that need to be taken into consideration when discussing this topic. For example, the effects of relying on other people for decision making, the correlation between confidence and decision making, the difference between listening to others' opinions and making your own decisions, and how all of these factors can affect a person's path in life.

9145AB74E1DA,"I don't think it's a good idea to work from home they're a lot of kids that would just take advantage from working from home. Kids would rather be at home then have to go to school at seven in the morning. They're different kinds of people out there who would stay at home just because they didn't feel like getting up so early in the morning. Other kinds where kids put effort into going to school. I don't think working from home is a good idea for school students.

There are some kids that can't really work at school, but then they're others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. School may be difficult but that's why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help. Some people are visual learners like right infront of you that's is why i think kids shouldn't work from their homes. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner that's is why working in school is the better idea.

I'm not saying saying it wouldn't benefit the kids who are doing their work online i'm just saying working in school is easier. I'm saying some students wouldn't benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. They're a lot of reasons is to why I don't think working from home or working online is a good idea. You never know who your going to meet online. Some kids don't have internet access so they wouldn't be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you.

My opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, they're at home. Learning at school is way more helpful then learning online you always have someone there to help.

1FD55698D1E5,"Summer is already a time where students want a break from school and adding a summer assignment will make students less motivated to do it. If students are able to design their own summer projects they'll have more motivation, use their own creativityÂ and avoid procrastination.

First, students tend to always procrastinate with a lotÂ of homework assignments,especially over big breaks. This can lead to not doing an overall good job on a project, which can then lower students grades. When I was in my freshman year of high school, I had a summer assignment due by the first week of school. I had to read any book that my teacher had put on a list. The list was of super boring poetry books that I had nothing in common with. I had to pick a book so i finally picked this random book, Fly. I didnt want to read this book so I waited until the last week of summer break to read it. Little did I know that I had to write an essay, create a poster about the book and create a short film about it. I was up every night that week trying to complete it last minute. When I got to the first week of school I had received a 78 on the project. This was not the best I could of done, but because I waited last minute I got a low grade. If I had a book that I was interested in this would all of been avoided.

Next, creativity is something that people lack nowadays, they always rely on others to create something for them such as projects, work, etc. If students are challenged to use their own creative minds to create a project it will help them for the future when they need to do these things for jobs. I am someone who hates being told what to do and how to do something, so being able to design my own project will make me want to do it even more. I had a project that I got to design for my chorus class that I was in my sophomore year. I got to create a schedule for elementary school choirs, that was the topic I got to choose myself because it seemed interesting. I did my own research and found the perfect teaching plans for an elementary school choir class. It was such a good project because I was able to create exactly what I was passionate about, but it was still related to the class I was in. The elementary school across the street from my high school liked my ideas so much from my project that this year they use it for their lesson plans.

Lastly, students already have very little motivation to do anything in the summer time. All they want to do is have fun and not have to worry about school projects. Teachers expect us to want to do everything that they assign and thats not always true. If they want to keep students motivated and to do something well done, then teachers should have students do their own work. Forcing us to do something also makes students not motivated. In my sophomore year, I had a few teachers force us to do assignments that were very boring and it made me not motivated to do it at all. If I was able to design my project I would of been happier and not have felt forced to do it. I would of enjoyed working on the project and I would of done my best on it.

It is nice when teachers come up with ideas on assignments because then students will have deadlines to complete it by, its more organized and teachers dont have to worry about students going off topic, but having students pick what they want to do will make a better project overall because students will be more motivated to do it, turn it in on time, not procrastinate and use their own creativity inside of their summer projects.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

If I haven't told you what their names are, I'll tell you right now! My brother's name is Generic_Name, and my sister's name is Generic_Name, My name is Generic_Name. My siblings are pretty annoying, but I still love them. It was really sunny, and warm, Then this cute guy came, and right away I text my friends about it.

My brother somehow started playing with Generic_Name. Generic_Name told me he already knew Generic_Name. He had a really cute little sister, and she's two years old, and her name is Generic_Name, and Generic_Name is ten years old.

I asked Generic_Name what his brother's name was, he told me it was Generic_Name. When Generic_Name told me his brother's name, my heart started beating really fast, I was really happy that I would do anything in this world.

Generic_Name comes up to me, and says hi, I was really nervous, me and Generic_Name were talking while are siblings were playing. We got to know each other, and now we're best friends.

I'm so glad I met Generic_Name! We have so much things in common, we both like the same sport, which is soccer. The saddest thing is that we don't go to the same school, I go to Generic_School, and he goes to Generic_School. We got each others instagram, snap chat, and our phone numbers.

We all wanted to hang out again, but tomorrow It's going to rain, and It's going to be really muddy, and wet outside. We got home, and we ate dinner, we all took a shower, and did our night routine. I had so much notifications from my friends, I totally forgot i sent them a text, I told them everything that happened. We had school tomorrow, and me and my friends were talking about it, but Generic_Name didn't seem as happy, as we all did. She told me she needed to talk to me, but in secret. So we went to the library. Generic_Name told me she knew Generic_Name, and she told me so much bad thing about Generic_Name. Generic_Name is Generic_Name's ex girlfriend.

I was very upset, and started crying, I went straight to my house, and Generic_Name came with me too, she's my best friend, and she's always there for me, when I really need her the most, I told Generic_Name what Generic_Name told me. Generic_Name told me that all those bad things she told me about Generic_Name aren't true, she did that, so I would stop liking Generic_Name. I called Generic_Name that I needed to talk to him, so I gave Generic_Name my address.

Generic_Name came over, I told him everything that Generic_Name told me, he told me she was lying, because she's jealous of me, and she liked him, but Generic_Name didn't feel the same way as Generic_Name did.

Generic_Name told me that he liked me since the time, he made eye contact with me. I really didn't expect Generic_Name telling me that, I thought he would never like me. I don't trust a lot of people just my best friends, and my most favorite teacher, because the people that care about you the most, are the ones that want the best for you, they're not jealous of you, like Generic_Name was. Girls shouldn't change over a guy that doesn't feel the same way as you do, and boy's shouldn't either! God has someone waiting for you!

If you really trust someone, don't loose their trust! A lot of people can give bad or good experience to you, but you have to see who's being a bad friend to you, and who's being a good friend to you. There are a lot of people that can give you bad influence, and a lot of people can give you good influence. Be careful in who you trust, there are several people that are there for you no matter what. If there is something wrong with you, talk to the person you feel more confident talking to, you can talk to your mom, dad, your principle, counselor, dean, or anyone you truly trust.

There's always a time where you accept some bad friendships, that give you bad influence, but it's okay. I did to for accepting my friendship with Generic_Name, if she really was a good friend, she would of told me she wants the best for me, and not lie about something that isn't even true, When someone lies to you, it's hard for you to gain their trust. You have to learn your lesson to the people that lie, your realize how you loose friends by just lying.

Me and Generic_Name are now dating, we are focusing in school, because school is important, and no matter what others say, me and him are going to be happy, and no one will ever change that.

88ECDCC89475,"The Importance of Individuality and its Role in Achieving Great Accomplishments

Individuality is a unique quality that sets each person apart from the rest. It is the essence of what makes us human, and it is what allows us to achieve great accomplishments in life. Throughout history, there have been countless examples of individuals who have used their individuality to make a difference in the world. In this essay, I will explore the importance of individuality and how it leads to the greatest achievements.

Firstly, individuality allows us to think outside the box and come up with innovative ideas. When we are not constrained by the expectations of others, we are free to explore our own thoughts and ideas. This is what allows us to come up with new and unique solutions to problems. For example, Albert Einstein was a prime example of individuality. He was not afraid to challenge the status quo and came up with groundbreaking theories that revolutionized the field of physics.

Secondly, individuality allows us to pursue our passions and interests. When we are true to ourselves and follow our own path, we are more likely to find fulfillment and happiness in life. This is because we are able to focus on what truly matters to us, rather than trying to fit into someone else's mold. For instance, Steve Jobs was known for his individuality and his relentless pursuit of innovation. He was able to create products that were not only functional, but also beautiful and unique.

Lastly, individuality allows us to overcome obstacles and challenges. When we are faced with adversity, our individuality allows us to find unique solutions and approaches to overcome the obstacle. This is because we are able to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions that others may not have considered. For example, Elon Musk has faced numerous challenges in his career, but his individuality and determination have allowed him to overcome them and achieve great success.

In conclusion, individuality is a crucial aspect of achieving great accomplishments in life. It allows us to think outside the box, pursue our passions, and overcome obstacles. Throughout history, there have been countless examples of individuals who have used their individuality to make a difference in the world. By embracing our own unique qualities and approaches, we can achieve great success and make a positive impact on the world around us.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,6

I respect that you want us to take community service to help the environment. And I am willing to spend my time to do it. This is a good way to help mother nature and the Earth. Other people may think that this is absurd work. They are just too lazy to stand up for themselves and finally do something right for the community. They have no reason to object this kind of offer! If they object, then they have no reason to be an American citizen. That may be harsh , but that is the truth. No matter how harsh this objective is to help the community, I will gladly do my best. after all that is said I will take part on this community service that you provide for the school. I believe with my honest heart that two thirds of the students will accept your kind offer. They are willing to take part on this amazing community service that you are holding for us. You have made a perfect decision to give out community service for your students. Before there were community service, the Earth was a piece of trash. But, since people and students are taking action, they are finally cleaning the mess. Now, the Earth is becoming to clear up. Therefore we could smell the fresh air instead of the polluted air. We still need to take part to make the Earth 100% fresher and cleaner for us to smell. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Your student",0,persuade_corpus,,6
D87F1B0CE93F,"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" By saying this I believe he meant people should never be lazy but to always be working towards something. Not doing anything and waiting for something to happen is not realistic. Working hard to get something feels so much more cherish able. Being able to out figure a way to accomplish something can help benefit others.

I believe we always accomplish more if we are always doing something whether it be small things or big things, we always have to keep moving forward. By moving forward we get to discover new things and see a change. Working towards a goal helps us to become more aware and understanding of the world around us. By always doing something we are always moving forward no matter what it is. Not doing anything is bad because you are just wasting your time and sometimes other peoples time too.

An example of being active and it helping/benefiting someone is if a person gets good grades so they can get into a better collage. By working towards getting better grades the outcome is getting into a good collage. Working towards a goal is beneficial and an accomplishment.

Inactivity doesn't serve a purpose at all but maybe in small aspects it does. It all depends on the type of situation. For example if someone is having a bad day you can't change their mood they have to do it themselves so in this situation you can't do much for them. By not being active accomplishments aren't being met rather someone else doing it.

Actively working and trying to accomplish something is most ideal. Never attempting to do something is bad. Always try your best even if you feel like you can't. Trying is always the best option because at least you attempted to do something. Things can get done if we are always doing.",0,original_moth,"Task: Consider how being active and working towards a goal can be beneficial.

3D04759D458C,"Many people may argue that the landscape in the picture taken in 1976 was a landscape made by aliens. These people think the landscape was created by an alien because the picture resembled a human head with eyes, nose, and a mouth. In fact, this image became so popular in the next 25 years, that it started to show on books and magazines. Some people still think that the landscape was created by aliens. However, the Face was created by aliens has been proven false because the of the new data and research over the next 30 years showed that it was just a mesa.

Scientists examined this photo to actually prove if the landscape was actually made by aliens or not. After research, our NASA scientists and I proved that it was just a mesa which are common around Cydonia. To become more factual about this, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and took more pictures of the Face. This occured in 1998 with better cameras than the first ones taken in 1976. The picture became 10 times clearer than the first picture taken which led to our conclusion that it was indeed just a mesa.

In response to those who still believe that the Face was created by aliens, our data has shown that is not. We even took more photos in 2001 showing clearly that the Face is just a normal mesa. There were no human features in the pictures that were taken in 2001 unlike the ones from 1976. Our scientists and I ensure you that this is just a regular mesa which are common to find. The Face from 1976 just had shadows that made it look unusual. ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

Diverless cars will be safer that regular cars. When diverless cars advance to the point that they can operate without human intervention, the cars will opperate without error. Humans are imperfect. No human has perfect judgement. A computer program running the car will make less errors that a human.

Driverless cars will be cheaper than modern cars. As our techology advances, the cost of new technology will decrease. In the aticle, It is mentioned that a radar small enough to fit in a car cost two hundred million dollars. A radar today costs a fraction of that. Since techology is advancing, previously new techologies are becoming cheaper. This will make driverless cars more affordable.

Driverless cars will be cleaner that modern cars. The technology withing the car will allow it to plan the most fuel efficient routes and use less fuel. this will lead to a smaller carbon footprint per car.

06E5ACD7F079,"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" focuses on the complex software that can analyze a face and even read emotions. The author claims this could be very useful in teaching, for being able to acount for the student's emotions could very well help the computer adapt and change the lesson more efficiently. While this could be true, there are a lot of questions that should be asked before this technology can be implemented, such as it's effectiveness and privacy.

The sixth paragraph says how the computer can know if you're happy or sad, and gives an example ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad may follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This seems to be very helpful, but what if said person was smiling about something else? what if the person remembers something funny that happened the other day and suddenly they notice they keep getting uninteresting ads that pop up? There would be no way for the computer to tell if it was really the ad that made the person smile. Another issue is how it is used in class. Paragraph six states ""A classroom computer could recognize if a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" How would the computer tell what degree a pupil is confused? If a student looks a little confused, the computer may read this and respond as if the student was very confused, thus wasting the student's time with more help than they need. One more way to look at it is the privacy violations the software may bring. What if a student is opposed to a teacher being able to technologically and truthfully read the students emotions? does the computer take a log of the faces of the students? There is too many suspicious questions in regard to the morality and safety of the use of such software.

Would you like to be part of the Seagoing Cowboys program? If you don't, I am going to tell you about a text I read about a man. In this text, it says that a man named Luke Bomberger was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime.

It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA, a relief and rehabilitation administration. UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and his friend Don signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. In the text it also says that Luke went on cattle-boat trips. He also got to go to many places across the country. He also found time to have fun on board, ecspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That oppotunity of a lifetime is good to have because you could experience adventures you have never experienced before, and that is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

On one hand, having additional time spent in school would give students more time to understand the material and complete their work, leading to improved grades. Furthermore, longer hours may discourage them from skipping school, leading to higher attendance records. On the other hand, lack of proper resources such as textbooks, additional staff, and educational materials may lead to lower quality of education and limit students' ability to truly benefit from the additional school hours.

94131A88E955,"Year-round education versus traditional school approach: which one is better? This is a question that has been debated for a long time, and as an 8th grader, I think it's important to weigh the pros and cons of both methods.

One of the main advantages of year-round education is that it can improve learning retention. When students have more time to learn and review material throughout the year, they are more likely to retain it. This is especially important for subjects like math and science, where concepts build upon each other. For example, if students don't have time to review what they learned in the fall, they might struggle to understand new material in the spring.

Another pro of year-round education is that it can reduce student effort. When students have more time to learn and review material, they don't have to cram as much information into a shorter period of time. This can lead to less stress and more balance in their lives. For example, if students have more time to focus on their extracurricular activities, they might be more motivated to participate in sports, music, or other interests.

However, there are also some cons to year-round education. One of the biggest drawbacks is that it can disrupt school board schedules. If students are in school more frequently, it can be harder for parents to schedule appointments or events around their children's schedules. This can be especially challenging for families with busy schedules or those who live far away from school.

Another con of year-round education is that it can lead to more tests. When students are in school more frequently, they are likely to have more tests and assessments. This can be stressful for some students, especially those who struggle with test-taking. While it's important for students to learn how to manage their time and prepare for tests, too many tests can be overwhelming and take away from the learning process.

In contrast, the traditional school approach has its own set of pros and cons. One of the main advantages is that it provides a consistent routine for students. When students are in school for a set amount of time each day or week, they know what to expect and can plan their schedules accordingly. This can be especially important for students who have a hard time managing their time or who have a lot",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

falcon_180b_v1_846,"Dear principal,

I am a ninth-grade student and I am writing about the proposed policy to only allow students with a grade B or better average to participate in sports and other activities. I understand that you want us to focus on our studies, but I think this policy is not fair because it will discourage many students.

Firstly, not every student is good at all subjects. It is unfair to punish a student who is good at sports or other activities because of their grades in other classes that might not be their strengths. For example, a student may be an excellent athlete and have an A or B in Physical Education but struggle with Math and Science, resulting in a grade C. This does not mean they should not be allowed to participate in sports or other activities, as it may be their passion and a way to relieve stress.

Secondly, sports and activities can also help improve our grades. Being part of a team or club can help us learn time management skills, which can help us balance our academic studies better. It can also give us an incentive to do well academically, as we will want to keep playing or participating in activities we are passionate about.

Finally, this policy will also hurt students who are involved in sports or other activities as it may lead to them losing interest in school. If students cannot participate in sports or other activities, they may feel disconnected from school and may not see the point of attending, which can result in poor grades.

I hope that you will consider these points when deciding whether to enforce this policy or not. It will have a big impact on our school community, and I hope that you will make the right decision for us. Thank you for your consideration.

BDA166D1989A,"As an eighth-grade student, setting goals is an important aspect of my life. However, the level at which I set my goals can have a significant impact on my personal growth and development. In this essay, I will argue that setting goals to a higher level benefits me more than setting goals to a low level.

Firstly, setting goals to a higher level allows me to challenge myself and push myself to achieve more. When I set goals that are too easy, I don't feel like I am growing or improving. However, when I set goals that are challenging, I am forced to work harder and develop new skills. For example, when I set a goal to read 100 books in a year, I was able to learn new genres and expand my vocabulary. This experience not only helped me grow as a reader but also taught me discipline and perseverance.

Secondly, setting goals to a higher level allows me to gain more experiences and knowledge. When I set goals that are too low, I am not challenging myself to learn new things or try new things. However, when I set goals that are challenging, I am forced to step out of my comfort zone and try new things. For example, when I set a goal to volunteer at a local animal shelter, I was able to gain valuable experience working with animals and learn more about animal welfare. This experience not only helped me grow as a person but also taught me empathy and responsibility.

Counter-argument: Some people may argue that setting goals to a low level is beneficial because it allows them to build confidence and self-esteem. However, I believe that setting goals to a higher level can also have this effect. When I set goals that are challenging, I am able to achieve them and feel proud of myself. This feeling of accomplishment can boost my confidence and self-esteem. For example, when I set a goal to get an A on a difficult math test, I was able to achieve it and felt proud of myself. This experience not only helped me grow as a student but also taught me the importance of hard work and determination.

In conclusion, setting goals to a higher level benefits me more than setting goals to a low level. When I set challenging goals, I am able to push myself to achieve more, gain more experiences and knowledge, and build confidence and self-esteem.

First, when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, they snapped a picture that was ten times sharper then the orginail photos from the Viking, and it turned out just to be a natural landform. But people were not satisfied, they were saying that the camera on board had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face, maybe the alien markings were hidden by haze. So they looked again, ÂItÂs not easy to target Cydonia,Â says Garvin. ÂIn fact, itÂs hard work.'' said Gavin, but on a cloudless day, they looked again and found nothing but the landform again.

Second, When Gavin travled out to Mars he said that the landform reminded him of a natural landform in the American West. In the article, Gavin said ÂIt reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.Â Gavin looked at the face many times, even during the cloudly days and the cloudless days and he sees the Face as a landform, and there are pictures from a advanced camera to prove it.

Once the scientists released the photo of the Face to the world for all to see, thats when the problems started coming in. People and a few scientists were starting to believe it was actually a alien face, but most since the Martian mesa are really common around that area then why are people worrying? Its just a landform, not only did the Viking air shuttle take the pictures but also an advanced camera did.

C41E40F2D803," Do you know how many career options are available to you when you enter high school? Most new students in high school begin to consider what career they would like to pursue after graduation. While some argue that students should not commit to a career at a young age because it can put pressure on them, I believe that students should commit to a career at a young age to better prepare for the future and have more time to choose a career they truly enjoy.

One of the main reasons why students should commit to a career at a young age is that it allows them to better prepare for their future. By committing to a career, students can begin to research and understand the requirements and expectations of that career. This knowledge can help them to make informed decisions about their education and future goals. Additionally, students can begin to save money to pay for college and other expenses related to their chosen career. This can help to alleviate some of the financial stress that comes with pursuing a career.

Another reason why students should commit to a career at a young age is that it allows them to have more time to explore different career options. By committing to a career, students can focus their efforts on researching and understanding the different aspects of that career. They can also take advantage of resources such as career counseling and internships to gain a better understanding of what they want to do. This can help students to make more informed decisions about their career path and increase their chances of success.

In conclusion, committing to a career at a young age can provide students with many benefits. It can help them to better prepare for the future, have more time to explore different career options, and make more informed decisions about their career path. While it is understandable that some students may feel pressure to commit to a career at a young age, the benefits of doing so far outweigh any potential negative consequences.

Many people use their cellphone daily, for some their cellphone is a part of their life, it helps them to communicate with others and ;their phone keeps them connected to news and events all around the world. On the contrary phones may be a distraction when a driver is behind the wheel. When someone is driving they should be aware of their surroundings at that point in time.

Reasonably, people need to set their phones aside while they are operating a vehicle. The chances of an accident are increased when the driver has a phone in hand. Your eyes must remain on the road and with the hands on use of a cellphone, it is not possible. Drivers need to practice safe driving and be attentive behind the wheel. Safety always comes first, especially on the road.

Countless car accidents have happened because a driver was more into their phone rather than what was happening on the road. Once you realize you may crash the vehicle when you look up from your phone it is often too late. If a driver puts their phone down when they are behind the wheel, they will be more attentive. An aware driver has a significantly lower chance of an accident in comparison to an unaware driver.

Subject: The Benefits of Keeping the Electoral College
 
Dear [Senatorâs Name],
 
I am writing to you today to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in place for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves important purposes and should be preserved. In this letter, I will present arguments in favor of the Electoral College system, drawing evidence from various sources.
 
One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Judge Richard A. Posner argues that disputes over electoral votes are less likely to occur than disputes over the popular vote. He states that because the winner-take-all system is used in most states, even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide victory in the electoral vote for that state (Posner, 2012). This system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote exceeds their share of the national popular vote, reducing the likelihood of contested election results.
 
Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the concept of a president who represents the entire nation. As Judge Posner suggests, a presidential candidate must have broad trans-regional appeal to win the electoral vote. This prevents a candidate with only regional support from being elected and ensures that the president will be accountable to the interests of people from all regions of the country (Posner, 2012).
 
Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign across different states, including swing states. Bradford Plumer points out that candidates tend to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain (Plumer, 2008). This means that voters in swing states receive more attention from candidates and may be more informed and thoughtful in their voting decisions. In turn, this ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who are well-informed about the candidates and their policies, have a greater influence in deciding the election.
 
Moreover, the Electoral College system balances the weight of large states against smaller states, addressing the potential imbalance created by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Judge Posner argues that the Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates because winning by a similar margin in a large state yields more electoral votes than in a small state (Posner, 2012). This allows candidates to address the concerns and interests of both large and small states, preventing an imbalance in representation.
 
Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections can complicate the election process. Posner (2012) highlights that the Electoral College method selects a clear winner, even if the popular vote results in a plurality. This ensures a more straightforward and conclusive outcome, reducing the uncertainty and potential for prolonged election disputes.
 
In conclusion, the Electoral College serves important functions that benefit the nation as a whole. It provides certainty in election outcomes, ensures that the president represents the entire country, encourages candidates to campaign in diverse states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While some argue for a popular vote system, the Electoral College remains a crucial component of our democratic system. I strongly recommend preserving the Electoral College to maintain its numerous benefits.
 
Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I hope that you will take these arguments into account as you make decisions regarding the future of our presidential election system.
 
Sincerely,

4FDC96B8E462,"Many European countries have been making a move towards limiting car usage in efforts of halting pollution, adding exercise to everyday life, conserve resources, and improve safety for others. An example of this phenomenon is Vauban, Germany, where suburbs are not allowed to drive vehicles. Doing this has helped improve society by bringing people closer to each other and removing the stress of traffic. Other people create a holiday for this, Car-free day, where people can only get around by public transportation and walking. As countries become more urbanized, there is a lesser need for cars to get around as the city is closing in on us.

Various countries have been making cities more dense and bring stores and businesses closer to neighborhoods, with the idea of Smart Planning. This idea is making communities more compact, like Vauban's 5,500 residents living within a square mile. With this, the need of cars is drastically reduced, creating a stress free environment that is less polluted and clean. Also, to dicourage the use of cars, there are only parking garages on the edge of town and barely any parking spots, leaving more room for sidewalks and housing developement. People began to walk socialize along the way, allowing exercise and social benefits.

Car pollution has been a major problem ever since the first cars were made. In the Paris, the smog became so thick, they had to partially ban driving. Even license plates one day, the next odd license plates. Congestion was down 60% after 5 days of intense smog. This pollution was due to the French government subsidizing and favoring Diesel fuels. In this time, all public transits were free of charge and people walked to get to where they needed to be. However, delivery companies lost revenue, but exceptions such as plug in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying 3 or more people.

In America, the reccession has had a devastating effect on some people, many couldn't afford to drive due to gas prices, and sold their cars. ""A study last year has found that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009"". This means that Public Transportation, car-pooling, and pedestrian are becoming a more commonly used way of getting from A to B, and are more affordable.

Companies like Ford got together at the Mobile World Congress and laid out a business plan for a world in which vehicle ownership is impractical and undesirable. Their chairman, Bill Ford, proposed partnerships with telecommunication companies. They want to make cities that are more based on pedestrain, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportion. Doing this, they think it will save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.

The world changes slowly, and these ideas might never catch on. Today, there is a lesser need of cars as cities become more urbanized and as we start facing an environmental problem. Better city layouts are being made to reduce the need for vehicles by bring businesses closer to neighborhoods. People are sponsoring no car days, smog reduces, and people find that they don't need cars to get around.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
998E0F68318B,"Distance Learning: the Solution

While walking the halls of a high school building during the winter, one can hear sneezing, coughing, and the constant blowing of noses. Students walk the halls half dead and slouched over. They come to school sick because missing a day of school can be catastrophic to their grades. In the past 40 or so years, most high school students have gone from taking one or two AP level courses, to six or seven. These fast paced classes can do wonders for a grade point average, or they can ruin it. AP classes are so fast paced, missing a day of school means missing vital learning time. By the time sick students get back on their feet, their class has probably moved on to another unit. A solution to this problem? Distance learning. Providing students with a way to take classes from home would reduce the amount of sick students in school and help them to stay on task, no matter their location while giving them more time to do the things they enjoy.

Schools have become cesspools for diseases like strep, the flu, and colds. Students come to school sick because they believe they have to, and in some cases they are right. Missing school means makeup work, which is a task most students would want to avoid. Having double the amount of work while simultaneously getting over an illness causes sleepless nights of stress and anxiety. As a way to avoid makeup work, students have started to come while sick. The sickness will spread throughout the school and cause outbreaks, more students will come sick to keep up with schoolwork. The best way to stop this is through distance learning. Through video chats students will be able to keep up with their learning and work while sick or injured. Distance learning will keep kids at home and the spread of germs will be stopped. Students will also no longer have to stay up late to teach themselves difficult material. Distance learning is the best solution to the epidemic of sick students in schools.

More time. That is something very student wants. Colleges are no longer looking for just good grades, they want someone who made varsity in their sport, is well rounded in their club choices, works a solid job, and has given back to their community. If you look at the average day of a high schoolÂ student, you will see they start with morning club meetings, usually at 8 A.M, then at 9:15, about seven hours of school. At 4:03 P.M. most will go to athletic practice for three to four hours, they'll get home at 8 or 9 P.M. and then sit down with two to three hours of homework. They'll sleep at 12 A.M. or later and wake upÂ at 7 A.M. the next day to do it all over again. Most will volunteer or go to a part time job over the weekend. So when exactly does a student have free time? The answer is easy. Never. Distance learning will solve that. Almost all students have a study hall during the day, an hour and a half to just do homework, through distance learning that study hall turns into an opportunity. Students could grab food with their friends, get ahead in their classes, hold club meetings online, or even get some rest. The format of distance learning allows students a more flexible schedule, they can sit in on a video chat while cleaning their room. Distance learning will help students to free up time out of their day and make them less stressed.

Some parents may argue that distance learning will cause students to become lazy and socially awkward. Attending school from home means students can sit in bed in their pajamas and work on assignments, and the lack of interaction between students will cause them to lose their social skills. Both of those ideas, however, are false. Most high school students do not put in the effort to dress nicely for school everyday already, they would rather be comfortable then look nice. Through video chatting, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers, everyone needs social interaction and distance learning takes that into account. Many students find it easier to learn while sitting at a desk or table, both of which are very common in any household, therefore, students lazing around in bed while learning is highly unrealistic.

Distance learning is a solution to the large amount of sick students and high levels of stress. By giving them more free time and a place to work on school from home, distance learning allows students to have a more enjoyable school experience. Many students will agree that there is just not enough time in the day to get all their work done, distance learning will provide them with a way to adequately keep up with studies while giving them time to work on other tasks. Schools have progressed to become more difficult as time has passed, causing the systems to become outdated. Students are unhappy with the way schools are currently run, its time for a change.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
937CDD403137,"Driveless cars can be very dangerous. The reasoning to make these cars is kind of crazy to think about, waking up in the morning knowing that you don't have to drive all the way to work. Sounds pretty good right? But there are some downsides that come in to affect when concerding getting one such as the accidents they could cause, the money it takes to make, fix and to buy, and the history of drivless cars such as what companies that made them so far and if they have been sucsesfull or not.

One of the main reasons that driveless cares shouldn't be made anymore is the risk of accidents. That is where the technology kicks into play like passage 4 states ""Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars, but how much smarter did the cars need to be?"" This is th first question that comes to mind when thinking about these cars. Is there a way that these cars become to smart on thier own which causes accidents to occour such as the car taking over the sterring from the driver or when it is driving its self is it going to know when to brake or not.

The biggest reason why drivless cars should not be made is the money. This car could not be afforable in our world today with all the upgrades and new technology. Plus it would be way more money to get a ""smart car"" fixed then it would be to buy one, but the big factor of the money issue would be making them and how much it would be to put all that technology and software in to the cars and all the body work and sensors it would just be way to much money for the ordinarary man to afford.

Last but one of the key factors into why this ""driveless"" car should not be made anymore is the history of these vichles. Passage 3 states it best ""Many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads."" This is why when manufacturers of Google who made the first smart car said that it would be nearly impossible to make anymore smart cars unless there is something done to the roads.

All of these reasons are just a few of why the production of these driveless smart cars should stop. They would not help us in the world as much as they think they would.                  ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

Do you want an adventure? Maybe you should try something called seagoing. Seagoing would be a fun and educational trip where you get to help others, and make a diffrence in the world. The following reasons are why you should try seagoing.

In the text in paragraph number two it states that, ""It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left to ruins."" From this piece of infomaion you can tell that people in Europe are facing hard times and that is why it is important to help those people. Furthermore, in paragraph number, eight it talks about how the cowboys also found time to have some fun. For instance in the text it says, ""The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table- tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.""

From this sentance you can tell the cowboys did not only work but had fun as well. Not only this but in paragraph number five it talks about the sights of Europe and China. For example in the text it states that,"" Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

Also in the last paragraph it talks about how great the learning experince was. I know this because in the text it states that, ""It opened up the world to him. I'm grateful for the opportunity, he say's. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" For this piece of evidene I can infer that the trip was not just to see the sights and have fun but to get a learning exerince out of the trip. Many people may disagree with me and argue that the trip is not necessary. Why?

Well many people would say this trip is dangerous. For instance in the article, paragraph number seven it states that,""He slid down a slippery ladder on his backside."" This piece of information could be why people think this trip is to dangerous.

From the previous examples I think that is why you should go this trip. Rember this trip is not for realaxing, but for a learning, and hard working, once in a lifetime experince. Also rember that you can still have fun while working. ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
A1E09E155EF6,"After two tiring semesters of school, summer allows for students and teachers to finally take a break. Though this break is crucial to a students' success in the following year, it allows for them to lose vital information learned that school year. Through different assignments, such as projects, schools have found creative ways to combat this information lost, enabling students to retain and possibly learn new things during the duration of the summer. It is crucial, though, that these projects are teacher-designed. Teacher-designed projects will not only allow for the students to learn correct information, but they will also hold the students accountable for their work and enable a consistency in knowledge amongst the students' return.

Through teacher-designed projects, students will learn the correct information. With set rubrics and key points the students have to achieve, they are set on a clear, uninterrupted path to finishing their projects with precision and accuracy, aiding them in their retaining and learning of the correct information. Though many students are capable in designing their own projects, teacher-designed projects will simply enforce and guaranteed that the information learned and researched about is correct.

Teacher-designed projects will hold students accountable in their finishing by the deadline. By simply subtracting the component of the creation of the project idea, students are left with one less immense task in their finishing of their projects, aiding them in their immediate commencement. By making these projects teacher-designed, there will be no excuses, and or confusion, which will help in the students' completion of their summer projects on time. As opposed to a student-designed project, many students could be misled through not knowing and confused on what to do for a project, thereby leading many to be unable to reach the end-of-summer deadline.

By requiring the students toÂ complete a teacher-designed project, there will be a consistency in learning among them. Having a set topic, given by a teacher, to all of the students will allow for the equality and consistency in knowledge once they return to school from summer. Unlike teacher-designed projects, student-designed projects will lead the students many different ways, creating an imbalance in knowledge between each and every student. This will make it very difficult for teachers to plan their classes for the year due to the unknowing in what a student revised and retained during the summer.

In all, teacher-designed projects are significantlyÂ more effective and sufficient than student-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects will not only aid in a students' learning of accurate information, but will allow for the students to be equal in their knowledge in a certain area of study. Projects designed by teachers will also aid in a students' accountability of their work, leaving them with set, coherent guidelines and topics to follow. By the use of projects, designed by teachers, during the summer it will allow for a more effective and efficient school year.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
BC7CD211742E,"Life on another planet is something that is very hard to find scientific evidence for.

In the science world you always have to have many sources to prove something is real.

There were always claims that the Face resembling landform was made by alien people but where is the proof?

I am about to tell you how there is no reasonable explanation for the mesa on Mars being created by aliens.

First, I will tell you a little bit about me.

I am a scienctist and I worked for NASA when Viking 1 journeyed through space. Over the years, as more advanced photography have taken pictures of the mesa, it has led me to believe that the formation is not an alien artifact.

Also, the mount on Mars looks just like the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"".

Which makes me think it was just a coincidence that it looks like a face.

Next, the image from Mars Global surveyor in 1998 does not resemble a face to me at all.

The Viking 1 photo probably had bad shadows.

The face was ""formed by shadows giving illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"".

Further, the landform resmebles mountains and hills on earth; and other planets have mountains and hills too.

Moving forward, people think NASA is hiding something, but in reality finding other forms of life would benefit many studies and researchers.

""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

Finally, how come there is no other evidence of life on Mars?

Don't you think that aliens would have made other landforms?

In conclusion, life on other planets is very hard to prove.

We have many explanations for why the Face is a ""huge rock formation...which resmebles a human head."".

I hope in future years scientists find more proof leading towards that fact that the Face is a natural landform.              ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

One of the things I love about modeling is the ability to travel to different places and experience new cultures. As a model, you have the chance to work with designers from all over the world and showcase their creations to a global audience. This kind of exposure can be both thrilling and challenging, but it is also a great way to broaden your horizons and gain new perspectives on the world.

DEC50B420484,"Hey there! 

For this essay, I'm gonna compare and contrast the benefits of working with a group versus working alone. 

Working with a group has some pretty cool benefits.  For one, you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with way cooler stuff than you could on your own.  Like, imagine if you were trying to write a story, but you couldn't think of any good ideas. You could work with a group and brainstorm together, and before you know it, you've got a killer plot! 

Another benefit of working with a group is that you can divide tasks and work on them separately.  Like, if you're working on a project for school, you could divide the tasks among your group members so each person is responsible for something different. That way, everyone can work on their part and then come together to present the final product. It's like a team effort! 

But, working alone has its perks too!  For one, you can work at your own pace and take as much time as you need to finish a task.  Like, if you're working on a science experiment for class, you could work alone and take your time to make sure you get the results right. You don't have to worry about anyone else messing things up or holding you back. 

Another benefit of working alone is that you can be more creative and think outside the box.  Like, if you're writing a story, you could come up with some really unique and unexpected plot twists if you're working alone. You don't have to worry about anyone else's opinions or ideas, so you can just let your imagination run wild!

We were responsible for feeding, grooming, and exercising the horses, and it was incredibly rewarding to see them thrive in their new environment. Plus, the bond that forms between you and your horse is truly special, and it's a relationship that will last a lifetime.

The Seagoing Cowboys program also provides valuable skills and experiences that will benefit you long after the program ends. As a participant, I learned about teamwork, responsibility, and adaptability. Whether it was working together to navigate rough seas or caring for the horses in challenging conditions, I developed skills that will serve me well in whatever career path I choose. Plus, the program offers the chance to learn about maritime history and culture, which is fascinating and enriching.

Luke's experiences, as described in the article, are a testament to the incredible opportunities that the Seagoing Cowboys program offers. He rode horses on the beach in Japan, swam with dolphins in the South China Sea, and explored ancient ruins in South Korea. These adventures are not just exciting experiences, but they also provide a unique perspective on the world and its diverse cultures.

In conclusion, the Seagoing Cowboys program is an adventure unlike any other. It offers the chance to travel to new and exciting places, work with animals, and develop valuable skills. If you're looking for an experience that will broaden your horizons and enrich your life, then join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You won't regret it!",1,llama_70b_v1,"You have just read the article, 'A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.'

7f14b2a5,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight some of these advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased access to alternative transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the impact it has on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As stated in the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas where car dependency is high, it is possible to reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. This is particularly important as efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions become more urgent on a global scale.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a partial driving ban due to smog illustrates the detrimental effects of car emissions on the environment. The ban resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and smog levels. By limiting car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, cities can not only improve air quality but also create healthier and more sustainable environments for their residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the increased accessibility to alternative transportation options. The passage about Vauban, Germany, showcases a community that has embraced a car-free lifestyle. In this community, residents have access to a tram system and convenient walking and biking infrastructure. By designing communities in a way that prioritizes public transportation and pedestrian-friendly spaces, it becomes easier for residents to rely less on cars and utilize other forms of transportation. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a more active and healthier lifestyle.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, highlights the success of a car-free day initiative in reducing traffic congestion and promoting alternative forms of transportation. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can save on infrastructure costs associated with building and maintaining roads and parking facilities. Additionally, car-free initiatives can boost local economies by promoting the use of public transit, walking, and biking, which in turn supports local businesses and reduces the reliance on car-centric industries.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, increase access to alternative transportation options, and have economic benefits. As the passages demonstrate, this approach is being embraced in various parts of the world and can contribute to creating healthier, more sustainable, and livable communities. By prioritizing alternative transportation and designing communities with less emphasis on car dependency, individuals and society can reap the benefits of limiting car usage.",1,radek_500,,3

First of all, you gotta set those goals. Like, really set 'em. You know, like, ""I'm gonna be a doctor!"" or ""I'm gonna start a business!""  And then, you gotta work hard. Like, really hard.  You gotta put in the time and effort, even when it's hard. 

Now, I know some people might be like, ""But, how can I do big things? I'm just a kid/teenager/whatever!""  And I'm like, ""Well, you gotta start somewhere!""  You gotta start small, like, ""I'm gonna clean my room!"" or ""I'm gonna learn how to play the guitar!""  And then, you gotta keep going, like, ""I'm gonna get good at playing the guitar!"" or ""I'm gonna start a band!"" 

And, you know what helps? Having support from family and friends!  Like, they can be your biggest cheerleaders!  They can be like, ""Yeah, you got this! You're gonna do great things!""  And that can make you feel like, ""Wow, I can really do this!"" 

For example, did you know that Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, was actually fired from the company?!  Like, what?!  But, he didn't give up!  He kept working hard and pursuing his dreams, and look where he is now!  He's like, one of the most successful people in the world!

40C8F8E9E046,"Do the advantages of not driving a car outweigh the disadvantages? As cities start to give options for transportation like buses, terminals, and taxi's is it worth driving and spending money on gas. driving produces carbon dioxide which is bad for the air so some cities have banned cars for a day or even banned cars forever.

In the city of vauban, germany the residents have decided to give up their cars.

the city provides transportation with buses but most of thew stores or places to work have been placed in walking distance. as a result people started to ride bikes more which is a pollution free way of transportation. in the united states the enviromental protection agency is promotingÂ  car reduced communities and expertes believe public transportation serving suberbs will play a major role.

its horrible when there is so much pollution you have to ban driving for a day.

in paris they had to ban driving because there was so much smog that they had clear nthe air. as a result the smog was clear just after one day just because half the city of paris didnt drive. in the city of bogota, colombia they ban driving one day every year to promote alternative transportation and to reduce smog. the people of bogota like the idea of using alternative transportation because it relieves the stress of driving. but for the first time two other cities decided that they wanted to participae in it so maybe one day the whole world will participate.

the idea of not driving might be a shock to some but not driving only has positive outcomes towards the enviroment and the only people that would suffer would be car companies. so what if the world stopped driving for the day how would the planet be affected?

B4C5B9F3FB4E,"Will students learn more if they design their own projects? Some schools require students to work over the summer to assure they keep learning and can come prepared for a new school year. However, most of the time these projects are designed by teachers, making them boring and repetitive. Students will be able to plan and find a good solution to create a project that will be easy for them to finish. They will not just be learning about a certain subject, but they will be also learning new skills. While some people might think that summer projects should be teacher-designed; it is a better option if they are student-designed because it helps them work on creativity, teaches them to work as a team, and gives them the opportunity to learn their own way.

Students will work on their creativity, while thinking on ways of learning. Projects are made so students can develop what they are studying in a certain class, but these can be boring sometimes. This idea makes students work and think like teachers, by creating activities that will help them continue gaining knowledge. I can be creative when I am given the opportunity. Designing a project, is a fun way for me to think and come up with different ideas to create a project that will help me and my peers to learn.

Working as a team it's a big part of life. Everywhere you go, you will have to work with other people. This can be at school, college, work, if you play a sport, if you do theater, etc. Working as a team requires of many skills: being patient, a good listener, and supportive. Many students, around the world, focus on themselves and are too individualist, or they just don't know how to relate with other people. Most of the time, the main reason of this is that they are shy and introverts. Fun activities, like this one, will help them be more open about it, and will help them work with their peers since they want to achieve a common goal.

This is a good opportunity for students to learn their own way. Most teachers leave many activities for students to do over the summer, without caring that this is their only long vacation after an exhausting year. For example, these activities are hard and too long; it gets to the point that students can't have fun because they are stressing out in order to finish these projects. Students are limited by the activities made by teachers; and creating a project is the perfect opportunity for them to think about everything they've learned without making it too complicated to solve. Most important, they will have the freedom to create a project without getting limited by their teachers.

Some people might say summer projects should be teacher-designed because they have more knowledge than students; however, they should be student-designed because it helps them develop new skills while learning at the same time. Summer time it's supposed to not be stressful for students; therefore they shouldn't be worrying about doing a project that takes long to finish. If students make their own projects, they can start off by thinking how much time they will be able to focus, during vacation, to finish school work; and finally they will come up with the perfect project for them. Learning can also be fun, specially if students will contribute with each other for a good purpose.Â    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
1DEA97747B2D,"In 1848 Antonio Meucci invented the first phone. Five years later in 1854 Charles Bourseul devised a phone. More than a century later in 1992 the first touch screen phone was invented it was called IBM Simon. This led to an evolution of phones that lasted almost thirty years later. Along with this phone evolution cars have had a just as impressive evolution as phone. In 1885 Karl Benz invented the first car. A year later Gottlied invented the engines for the car. Now although both inventions are very impressive, important, and developed well over time shouldn't mean we use them at the same time. That is why in this paper I'm going to explain why people shouldn't use cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

We have all been guilty of texting or scrolling through our social media. Sometimes we catch our self just checking our phones without any alerts going off. In the process of doing this has cause an elevation of car accident leading to serious body injures or even death. This has cause text and driving to be illegal in all states in the U.S. The national Safety Council report that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6million crashes each year, nearly 390,000 injuries occurs. Over a million Family has had to say goodbye to a family member because our need for our pones. It has increased rapidly in teen drivers because they were born in a point where, we use phones for ever thing. This doesn't just affect the victim's family the driver family will also be saying goodbye to a lover one. On May 5, 2015 texting and driving becomes illegal. Even through texting and driving didn't become illegal officially unit 2015 people have been going to jail long before then. If a person is hurt badly in an accident the driver who cause the accident will get two years of jail time and five year's probation for assault. Drivers under eighteen face a Five hunderd dollar fine and a year of a suspended license. All these facts are why I strongly disagree with texting and driving.

Using phone while driven is something that can change if you are welling. This is something that everyone has a problem with but its time that we found the solution to it now. Even if it you are telling and showing your children the proper way to operation a motor vehicle without your phone. Teens you can help by telling your friend not to use their phone when you're in the car with them. Explain the severity of the solution if they don't stop then exit the car for you own safety.

DBB590C34361,"Going to school from home sounds like one of the greatest ideas to think of. There's no getting dressed or rushing to avoid missing the bus because all of the school work is online and can be done at home. It seems like a smooth and easy process. However, it could be very tedious, and for some, impossible. Students would not benefit from online classes/ classes at home because they they might not have the means to purchase a device to be able to take said class and because they can easily get distracted at home rather than at school.

One reason why students would not benefit from taking classes from home is because they might not have the money to purchase a device to do their work on. For example,some children are not financially stable at home, therefore they wont have a device to use to complete their tasks that they are assigned. This would mean that they would have to travel somewhere else to access a computer to do their work. Doing that defeats the purpose of the classes being at home because the student would have to go somewhere else to do the work. It would be smarter to attend classes at school because they provide you with electronic devices to complete your work on and there is no worry about purchasing a device to do work on.

Another reason why attending classes from home is would not benefit students is because it gives students a better chance to get distracted or procrastinate. For example, when most students come home from school, they watch TV, eat a snack, or take a nap. If students took online classes, they might end up getting distracted by the TV or eating. Some students also dont complete their homework at home because they procrastinate so much that its too late to do it. Attending classes at home just gives the student the opportunity to be lazy and complete their tasks only when they feel like it. Taking classes at school would be easier because students would not be able to get distracted by the TV or procrastinate as much and more work would get done rather than if they were to do it at home.

Some will argue that taking classes at home is beneficial because it eliminates getting ready for school. They might also say that it's easier because work can be completed at any time the student feels like completing it. However, some students might not be financially stable, and the only way they eat is when they're at school. Online classes could prevent some students from getting their well needed meal. As for the other reason, most jobs run on a schedule and have specific times that they prefer things to be completed. Coming to school will help equip students to be prepared for a job because at school, students run on a schedule and are expected to have things completed at a specific date just like a regular job does.

Attending online classes from home is not the best decision for many reasons. However, attending classes at school helps expose students to the world and to new things that they wouldn't be able to observe if they were to be at home everyday. It also helps students to adjust their lives to get ready for the ""adult world"" and to successfully obtain a job and be great at it. Also, As mentioned before, there's no hassle to purchase a device to complete work on because in school, all those things are provided for the student.

Although it would be nice to relax at home and take online classes, the smarter choice would be to attend classes at school to avoid procrastination and to avoid spending unnecessary money.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

darragh_claude_v7_935,"I disagree with the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurriculars can benefit students, mandating participation removes student choice and autonomy. 

Some key reasons for my position include:

- Not all students have the time or energy for extracurriculars on top of their academic course loads. Some need time for jobs, family obligations or independent study. Forcing activities could negatively impact their school performance or well-being. 

- Extracurricular interests vary greatly between individuals. A one-size-fits-all approach won't motivate all students and may result in token participation just to fulfill the rule. True engagement comes from personal passion, not requirements.

- Some students prefer focusing on academics without the added time commitment of activities. Their priorities should be respected rather than deemed inferior to a ""well-rounded"" profile. Not every path to success looks the same.

- Scheduling multiple activities can create conflicts that make balanced participation difficult. Unrealistic expectations will only lead to frustration on all sides. 

- Financial or transportation barriers exist for some that a mandate ignores. Not all families can support costs like equipment, travel or lesson fees. 

While encouraging involvement has benefits, requiring it removes student freedom and risks achieving the opposite of the principal's goal of engagement. A better approach would be providing diverse options and promoting each student's abilities to choose where their interests and circumstances allow. Mandates often do more harm than good when it comes to fostering commitment and learning outside the classroom.

9441e668,"Since the 1950's everyone's dream was to have a nice car but it is coming to a point in time where the car culture is coming to an end. You might be thinking that this is horrible and how will i get places without a car. No, it's not horrible at all, it's actually very beneficial in other ways. It can help people become free,less dependent,and it reduces the amount of greenhouse gases tremendously.

The first reason that limiting car use is a good thing is because it can help people become free and less dependent. It has caused people to not always be in a hurry and made them less stressed. In Bogota, Colombia they had a carfree day where people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. People felt so free and they felt they were doing a good deed so some got rid of their cars for good. Cars are becoming less popular in the world as we speak. For example from 2005 to 2013 the number of miles driven in the U.S.has reduced by 9%, which is equal to where the country was in 1995. Another example is that a study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. Also shopping centers are moving to places where they can be walked to rather than on a way off highway somewhere.""What intrigues me is that rates ofcar ownership per household and per person has started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" says Micheal siva who studies this trend at the University of Michigan.

The next reason is that increasing the use of cars will help the environment greatly. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe and 50% in the U.S. All of our development since World War 2 has been centered around cars and it hasn't helped the environment any. For example, in Paris they were going to have two no car days to reduce the smog. The first day they said that no one with and even numbered license plate were allowed to drive and odd would be the next. After the first day was over the smog was reduced by so much that they didn't even have to use the next day. This is just a small number of people. Imagine if everyone would participate even just for small periods of time.

In conclusion, now that you have learned that life without out cars can make you feel free, less dependent, and have the environment. Have you changed your opinion?

17643FC4CA90,"The worst feeling for a teacher is when their new class for the year walks in, and they barely even know what class they signed up for. Teacher designed summer projects provide students with an introduction to the the new material they will be learning for the year, and create a basis for the teacher to start off of during the beginning of the course. These projects assure that all students are on the same level, heavily reducing the work and stress put onto the teacher.

Most students nowadays will always look for the quickest and easiest way out. This leads to skipping over crucial learning aspects that are required thought the year. Furthermore, student designed summer projects wouldn't be nearly as effective as teacher created, due to how the students may be unaware of what they will be learning in the upcoming year. The students simply would not be able to create such a project that would be nearly as beneficial as a teacher created one. This concept can be show through diagnostic tests that students are prompted to take at the beginning of many courses. When tested on material about the class, the majority of students aren't even returned with a passing grade. The point of these tests are to show the improvement students make thought the year, and allow teacher to better understand what aspects of the class they need to go more in depth into. All being considered, students with a freshÂ mindset in any given class would not be able to create an effective summer project that would provide a strong lead wayÂ into the year.

All teachers have a certain amount of material they are supposed to cover thought the year, while in many cases they are given plenty of time to cover each topic of their course, time can becomes limited due to the extensive amount of time taken up at the begging of the year catching everybody up to speed on the basic foundations of the course. This can be greatly reduced if the summer projects that students are given, were designed by the teachers themselves. This allows the teachers to make sure everybody is on the same page at the beginning of the year, allowing a smooth transition into new content, and not wasting time on relearning the basics. This problem is present in many classes at the beginning of the year. An extensive amount of time is spent answering basic questions as to what the course is about, content from previous years, and basic fundamentals of the class that students should already know. All of these can be avoided by a well organized teacher created summer project because they know the course better than anyone else. Allowing teachers to create such a project would ensure both themselves, and the students are confident starting off the new year, and ready to learn.

Many students argue that student created summer projects would allow them to learn better because they will be able to pace themselves better. Many of people, including teachers, have found this to be true. Student created projects would ultimately allow them to create a fun project environment were they get to express their creative side, constructing a project that is both entertaining, and not as overwhelming as many teacher created projects, yet still covering material about the given course. This method, while at first glance may seem more effective, will not provide students with sufficient education and preparation that the teacher will have prepared for the year. By allowing teachers to create their own summer project for the students, it enables them to make sure all students are both prepared, and caught up with previous material that will set course for the challenging year ahead of them.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
darragh_claude_v7_791,"While summer breaks are intended to be enjoyable rest periods for students, requiring some structured learning activities can help prevent loss of knowledge and skills over the summer months. However, the type of summer project matters greatly in encouraging students' continued engagement with learning. 

Student-designed projects are more likely to inspire independent thinking and enthusiasm for learning compared to assignments strictly mandated by teachers. When given ownership over their work, students will be motivated to learn more about topics they find genuinely interesting. This leads to deeper understanding and better retention of information. By choosing their own areas of study, students can explore fields they are passionate about and expand their learning in a way that aligns with their individual strengths, curiosities and future goals.

Allowing students to have autonomy in shaping their summer work does not lessen academic rigor. With teacher guidance on establishing focused objectives and timelines, student-led projects can adequately challenge students while tapping into their natural drive to learn through self-directed study. Students may opt to delve deeply into an academic subject, investigate solutions to real-world problems, or undertake hands-on experimentsâall of which can stimulate higher-order thinking and foster lifelong learning habits. Presenting their work at the beginning of fall semester also builds students' communication and presentation skills.

Of course, fully open-ended summer assignments may not effectively address core curriculum. A balanced approach is optimal, where teachers provide a selection of options for topics aligned with class material but allow flexibility for students to target their specific interests and methods within those topics.

darragh_claude_v7_68,"Dear Principal Smith, 

I am writing to express my views on the proposed policy change requiring students to have at least a B average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. While maintaining academic standards is important, I do not think imposing such a strict grade requirement is the best approach. 

Requiring a B average would exclude many students who currently have a C average from participating in activities that they enjoy and benefit from. Sports and clubs provide important opportunities for learning skills, building relationships, and relieving stress. They also encourage exercise and good physical and mental health. For students who are struggling academically, cutting them off from these supportive activities could further discourage them and negatively impact their well-being. 

A C average shows that students are passing their classes and making an effort to keep up with their studies, even if they find some subjects more challenging. Participating in extracurriculars with a C average does not necessarily mean academics are being neglected. In fact, research shows that being involved in sports and clubs can actually motivate students to do better in school by teaching them important life lessons like discipline, time management and teamwork. These skills and experiences may even help improve a student's academic performance over time.

Rather than an outright ban for those with a C average, a more balanced approach could be to require students to maintain a C while also meeting regularly with guidance counselors or coaches to ensure their activities are not coming at the cost of their studies. Flagging any student who drops below a C for extra support may have a more positive impact on academic achievement than exclusion from enjoyable activities they value. 

In closing, while preserving academic standards is important, implementing an inflexible B average requirement risks doing more harm than good for many students. A less punitive policy that also supports and challenges students could achieve the goal of improved grades without unfortunate side effects. For these reasons, I do not think raising the bar to a B average is the best solution. Thank you for considering my views on this important issue.

959946A3FB03," The advancement of technology has allowed people to perform various tasks without any human interaction. While technology has its benefits, it also has negative effects on individuals' lives. One of the most significant drawbacks of technology is that it can lead to social isolation and a lack of interpersonal skills.

As technology becomes more prevalent, people are increasingly relying on it for communication and socializing. This reliance can lead to a lack of face-to-face interaction, which can have negative consequences on mental health and well-being. For example, individuals who spend too much time on social media may experience anxiety and depression due to the constant need for validation and attention.

Another negative effect of technology is that it can restrict individuals from experiencing the world around them. Technology can be used to avoid real-life experiences, such as travel and exploration, which can lead to a lack of personal growth and development. Additionally, technology can limit individuals' ability to form meaningful relationships with others, as it can be difficult to establish trust and intimacy through online communication.

Despite these negative effects, technology can also have positive impacts on individuals' lives. For example, technology can be used to connect people with others who share similar interests and hobbies, which can lead to new friendships and social connections. Additionally, technology can be used to access information and resources that may not be available in one's immediate surroundings, which can lead to personal growth and development.

In conclusion, while technology has its benefits, it also has negative effects on individuals' lives. It is important for individuals to strike a balance between using technology and engaging in face-to-face interaction and real-life experiences. By doing so, individuals can maximize the benefits of technology while minimizing its negative effects on their lives.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

3B1CE6EEA66E,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

To my understanding, it is a huge debate whether students should be required to perform some sort of community service or not. Not only does community service help the environment, your community, your neighbors, and the earth you live on, but is a great activity many students take part in, and i think that it should be required to all students.

In our world today, community service really make a difference. Our communities depend and prosper from people lending a hand to keep their environments safe. If more students were to perform community service, it would not only effect their living environment but also their learning environment. Our school is filled with many great students who love to help out, and i think community service will allow students to lend a helping hand.

There are many ways to help out in your community. You could help pick up trash in your neighborhood, or you could volunteer at a homeless shelter. You can have fun while helping out your environment. Students could help clean the area around their school, to keep it clean and make it more safe. Students could also volunteer at a local soup kitchen, to help make food for those who really need it. I think requiring students to do community service will not only educate students on how important it is to take care of their environment but it would also teach them to appreciate more of what they have, because seeing families or individuals who are less fortunate really makes you become more grateful for all the things you are supplied with.

Some students may not want to pick up trash or cook for the needy. Maybe some students prefer to work with animals. There could also be local pet hospitals, or animal pounds where you could help out at. Animals, also, need to be taken care of, and if all the animals living in your community are safe and healthy, it makes for a more safe and healthy environment for you to live in.

Community service really is a great way for students to help out and that is why i don't hesitate to say that it would benefit the whole school; the whole world. Whatever type of community service you do, it is still making the world we live in today a safer place for our present and for our futures.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
502A32AFDB6A,"Generic_Name used to be shy, but he joined basketball after school and made a lot of new friends and became so much more happier and gained a lot of confident as well. I agree that students should participate in an extracurricular activities because students can play sports they enjoy, get homework and tests done, and meet new people.

Most students like to pick sports as their extracurricular activityÂ because it is fun and students get to pick the sports they like the most such as basketball, soccer, volleyball, football,Â and floor hockey. Doing sports as your extracurricular activity can help you get into better shape and physically stronger. Students are usually stressed and want to go to bed after school but going out to run or playing a game can force their brains wake up. Playing sports can help with your sleeping because you've used up all your energy and in the morning you will wake up felling refreshed and energized.

We all have subjects were good and bad at and need more help than others. Staying after in a homework club or with aÂ teacher can make a huge difference to your learning and your understanding. If you stay after with a teacher they can help you one on one and talk to you through your work step by step, and it will show your teacher that you are willing to try and it will motivate the both of you to put an effort in. When you miss a day or two because you were sick it can be hard to catch up on all the work you've missed and the teacher can't sit with you one on one during class because they have to teach a new lesson toÂ the class, so staying after can give the teachers a chance to sit with you one on one so they can help you catch up. We all take tests but sometimes we don't have enough time to finish or had a hard time with the test and need more time but you can't miss your next class, but you can stay after and finish the test and refresh your memories and go over the notes you have. Staying with a homework club can let you work on work with your friends you are struggling with and work on group projects together.

Staying after in a club is a good idea because you can do activities you like to do such as art,Â chess, book club, computer arts, and music class. Some of the clubs may not be something you can have as your classes and you really enjoy doing them. When you stay after you can pick which activity you want to go to. Going to these clubs will allow you to meet new people with the same interests with you and you'll have something to talk about, you can make a lot of new friends too.

Having an extracurricular activity is good to be in and can benefit you in many ways. An activity that is enjoyable for most people is sports because you can play any sport you want and it can help get your energy out. Staying with a teacher can be helpful in many ways but it can help you get a better understanding, get tests done, missing assignments, and can help get you grade up. Another way extracurricular activitiesÂ can benefit is you is that you can make new friends and enjoy classes that aren't always available to you. In conclusion I agree that students should have an extracurricular active they enjoy because it can help then get into better shape, get homework and tests completed, and to make friends in classes that are fun and exciting.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
darragh_claude_v7_696,"Seeking multiple opinions when faced with an important decision or asking for advice is often a wise choice, as it allows the person to gather different perspectives on their situation and options. Getting input from more than one person can help provide a more well-rounded picture and reduce potential blind spots compared to just consulting a single source. 

Different people will look at a problem or choice through their own unique lens and life experiences. What one person sees as the clear best path forward may not be agreed upon by others. By consulting multiple individuals, the person asking for advice gains access to a wider array of viewpoints, insights, and ways of thinking about the issue at hand. This can help identify variables, constraints, or consequences that any single adviser might have overlooked alone. Considering different stances also enables the advice-seeker to evaluate how robust or widely-held each proposed solution may be.

Seeking multiple opinions further allows the advice-seeker to find commonalities or recurring themes across what different sources suggest. Ideas that multiple individuals independently flag as important carry more weight than one-off advice. Areas where most advisers converge likely represent wiser guidance than outlier or fringe opinions. The convergence of multiple perspectives helps validate strong suggestions and advise against more questionable or minority viewpoints. 

Finally, hearing varying opinions prevents the person from clinging too rigidly to the first perspective they heard or becoming narrowly focused early on. Keeping an open mind and weighing diverse viewpoints keeps more options on the table longer, increasing the chances of finding the best suitable choice given the complex realities of their situation. Cross-checking advice also protects against being misled by a poorly-informed or biased single source. Overall, the synthesis of multiple prudent counselors' insights provides a more thoughtful grounding for any important decision.

In conclusion, seeking advice from multiple reputable sources offers clear benefits when trying to make a major choice or solve a complex problem. It exposes the advice-seeker to a range of experience and thinking that a sole adviser cannot match, helping produce wiser, more well-rounded guidance.",1,darragh_claude_v7,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Explain why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Use specific details and examples in your response.",4
AF9939DC1EB2,"Many people want an education that is accessible to all types of students. Some schools are starting to offer online classes and video conferencing for students to get their education from home. More schools should start offering online courses because of students with severe social anxiety, students who get an extreme illness, and for students with gifted athleticism who need to devote most of their time to their sport.

Plenty of students have social anxiety but for some it comes worse than others. Some students walk alone in the halls because they just want to get from one class to the next with no interruptions, however, there are also students who do not choose to do walk alone because it comforts them. Social anxiety takes over their ability to want to talk to people and try and make new friends because of the fear of being judged or not accepted. With online courses they do not have to feel that sense of loneliness during school. They will be able to focus better and not have a constant fear of another student looking at them and making fun of them, they would not have to be scared of going to lunch and sitting alone, and their mind would be more clear from stress distracting them from their education. Students will be getting the same knowledge from an online course as in a physical school and they might be able to excel more than they would be in a classroom because of how comfortable they feel in their learning environment.

There are also ways to get kids who like interacting with people to still enjoy an online course. Students who get extremely ill and have to be out of school for a majority of the year but still love the face to face interaction with people can set up video conferences with teachers and get their education just as well as others. This is a great opportunity for students to stay on track with school when they are not able to attend school in a physical classroom. If schools do not offers these types of programs the school system would just be letting kids fall behind when they have no choice. No students want to stay back another year because they were got an extreme sickness. These video conferences and online courses can be the way to success for sickly students who need the little bit of extra help.

The one thing a student athlete could want is a little bit of help. Student athletes are working two lives, their school life, and their sports life. It is a completely different world for them and when it gets to the extreme some of them have no choice but to devote their whole life to their sport. Online courses might be their way to get the best of both worlds. Super athletes at a young age are offered a position on a professional team and asked to change their life so suddenly. They are not going to be regular kids anymore after that. The excitement builds up inside of them and they will take the great opportunity without even thinking of the consequences. If they get a career ending injury they will be done. Thinking their whole life is set for them to play a professional sport, thinking they do not need school anymore but as soon as reality hits them it is instant regret. Young athletes need to be prepared for the ""What if"" situation. Online courses can help them be prepared for these moments. They can fit an online course better into their schedule than going to a classroom for 8 hours of their day and still be getting an education. Most of a professional athletes day is training and recovery for the next day. Being able to spread out their classes and finding when it is most convenient for them to take online classes during the day would be a lifeline for young athletes. Playing a professional sport while being a teenager means giving up their normal teenage life but it does not have to mean giving up their education.

Some people may say online education would be too easy for kids and they need to be challenged in a classroom. At the end of the day an education is an education. Students can take that as seriously as they want to whether they are in a classroom, taking an online course, or having a video conference. The environment a student learns in is so crucial to the way they will be able to pass their classes to their best ability. More schools should start offering online courses and video conferences because of kids who struggle with social anxiety, students who get an extreme illness, and gifted student athletes who have to devote most of their time to their sport.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

5D5B9C621FF4,"I love us humans, and our little species-wide neural shortcuts. One example of a ""shortcut"" is face recognitioon. Our brains tell us what is human by looking at the face. The brain does have some flaws in this, though, because we tend to see faces where there isn't one. One of the most notable examples is the face on Mars. There is no way the ""face"" on the red planet was made by aliens, because as previously stated, the brain sees faces where there aren't any, the ""face"" is a common occurane on Mars, a mesa, and any alien proof would be seen in recent pictures. All of the evidence points towards the obvious conclusion, and the most likely scenario is probably correct, as Occam's Razor points out.

To begin, the brain tries to recognize faces, and it is really good at it. It says, ""Yep, that's a face!"" and that's because humans are social creatures. We need to recognize others that will be able to support us and stay together, because in ancient times, that, along with our ability to think and reason, was what we had going for us. As one source that I forget the name of stated, ""Pretty much the only thing we can outsprint by bodylengths per second is vegetables."" We could make tools and weapons to support ourselves, but to be effective, we had to team up. And that is why we see a ""man in the moon"". We see the face by craters. This is just the same thing, our brains being awesome at seeing faces, but not at recognizing the lack of a body to go with them.

Also, the ""face"" is a common occurance on Mars, a mesa. It is just a landform. This is shown by the NASA saying ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West."" The ""face"" is just a landform. The most recent picture shows the mesa in much more detail, and the face starts to fade away as the resolution increases.

As stated before, the picture resolution increases with each attempt at an image, and still no alien civilization! The article states ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" If there was above-ground alien civilization, we would have seen it by these pictures. The logical conclusion for the illogical is ""What if they are underground?"" and this is a valid point until you look at it more closely. To ""sculpt"" this landform, the aliens would have to dig out surrounding land, and that is hard, not impossible, but hard to do. And as stated before, use Occam's Razor. Also, they would most likely have to have some way to see humans, because the chances of aliens on a different planet in a different environment evolving similar faces to ours seems a little far-fetched. They would have some sort of visible, surface-bound satillite dish or something similar to recieve the signal.

Some might argue, ""Well, NASA is just covering up life on Mars."" and to that arguement, I say ""Good job! You are so close to logic!"" because while NASA could cover up the truth, they wouldn't do so. It would be good for business to discover some ""sentient alien life"" because the NASA budget would skyrocket! Everyone would want to know ""What they look like? Do they have a language?"" et cetera. Also, if they wanted to cover it up, no matter how much it would improve NASA, they have to release images publicly. If they managed to do some fancy photoshopping and release the images, there are people skilled enough to undo those photoshops and also, photoshopping leaves some computer traces around on an image, and there are plenty of free online sites that will spot those traces and show anyone where and how those touch-ups were made.

The most obvious conclusion is probably the right one, and all evidence points towards just a natural landform. The brain's ability to detect faces, the frequency of those landforms, and the ability to see alien civilization, if any exists, in more recent pictures proves the point of those who follow logic though the tinfoil-hat warriors try to say otherwise. Wait, is that a face in my soup?!",0,persuade_corpus,,3

One advantage of limiting car usage is that it is less stressful and it helps you save money. From source 1, Hedirun Walter said "" When I had a car I was always tense."" In the community you could own a car but you were not allowed to park wherever you wanted. You had to park it in large garages and you have to buy space for 40,000 with a home. So most people didn't have cars but they were saving lots of money. 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there cars to move to the community. Most of the people liked walking around the community or just taking the transportation they gave them. It peaceful and less traffic.

Another advantage is that it reduces pollution and also reduces global warming. From source 2, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" If they did not leave their cars at home they would have to pay a fine, 22euro 31. After they have had the cars off the streets ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the of france, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" The cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer to trap car emissions. They also blamed the diesel fuel...""A tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in france, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines.."" From source 3, Colombia had a ""carfree day"" where all colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the transportation buses to work. For 3 years they have been doing this being they wanted to reduce the smog. People who disobeyed had to pay 25 fines. "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""said businessman Carlos Arthuro. Since people have started walking or riding bicycles, they have improved the city by fixing the uneven sidewalks and making them smooth. Also since there is no traffic, "" new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" In conclusion, there are many advantages limiting car usage.

D58890A4F68C,"Dear Senator,

We the people, of the United States of America..... These are the first words written upon the Declaration of Independence. This is our very earliest document showing our democratic tendencies, and how we act as one. It also shows how we make decisions among ourselves as a people, as opposed to having other make decisions for us. This leads me to what I wish to discuss with you. Others do not vote for us. We vote for ourselves. We decide who leads us, who will help us get to a better place, who will decide what to do about the national debt, who will pass laws concerning immigrants and the minimum wage. We do. Not you, not the House of Represenatives, and most certainly not the Electoral College. Which is why there should be no Electoral College.

The Electoral College is a group of people whom elect the president(2). How many for each candiate there are is decided by us, the voters. But heres the thing- most voters think they're voting for the president. They dont even know what they're voting for! And even if some do, its easy to get confused and accidentally vote for the wrong candiate(10). While one vote may not skew the entire election, a couple thousand can.

Many who support the Electoral College will say that voting by popular vote is a bad idea becuase of the possibility of a tie(18). But in reality, it is just as easy to tie in the Electoral College. Its happened recently too, in 1888 and again in 2000(18).

This isn't the only thing thats broken about the Electoral College. The possibility that a president could win by popular vote, but lose the campaign due to the electoral vote is filthy. It is unfair to the people, and far from democratic. The Electoral College is an anachronism(15). It reminds me of the Roman Republic really, and we are not romans, and this is not a republic. Or, at least, its not supposed to be.

Something else that is unfair to the people. Due to the Electoral College canaditates only focus on large states, or swing states(13). Voters in small states, such as Wyoming, will never see the candiates and may see only one or two camaign ads. They can't get to know the candidates and make an informed decision. And even in the regional states, democrats should always be trying to convert republicans to their side and vice versa. But becuase of the large swing states, this rarely happens.

The possibilty of corruption among the Electoral College, is also a present danger. I'm sure you remember form history class how party bosses took advantage of naive immigrants. I can imagine republican electors being paid off or threatened so that they vote democrat. Can you really trust the electors?

According to a poll in 2000, 60% of people want to activate a popular vote system. Popular soverignty worked well for awhile when it came to the topic of slavery, why won't it work for us now? And why would anyone want such an outdated system like the Electoral College in place? Think upon my words Mr. Senator. The Electoral College needs to end.

These days limiting car use has more advantages than ever. Such advantages are that it helps reduce the amount of pollution to the environment, helps people save money, swell as it helps people become more sociable and less stressed.

The limiting of car usage has many advantages one would be that it helps to reduce pollution caused by fuel emissions. Using vehicles creates green house emissions which cause the Earth to become hotter and then global warming becomes a big problem. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."" by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive area in the United States. So limiting car usage reduces the amount of emissions produced greatly. Smog is also a great threat to the environment, smog is created just like fog except polluted air gets into the mix of warm days and cold nights. Then instead of getting fog there is smog a more dense unhealthy version of fog. Paris has had a rough time when it came to smog which according to ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer resulted from the fact that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France.

Saving money is a big plus to the restriction on car use. With more buildings and shopping centers being built closer to suburban area makes walking a good way to save money. Andrew Selsky author of the article ""carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" made a comment on the situation in Bogota saying ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"". With more shopping centers for people to be able to reach by foot, bike, carpool, or bus can greatly reduce the amount people spend on gas and car repairs.

Limiting the usage of cars also in a strange way helps people become more connected with each other. Limiting car use will alow people to hang out more in things such as carpooling, bike rides, walking, public transportation. Allowing for people to meet more people. Also it wil allow people to use things such as social media to stil feel connected to their freinds without having to drive out to meet them. In another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""The End of Car Culture"" Rosenthal interviewed professor Mimi Sheller Who stated ""the rise iin cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arranments,includiong the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. The restriction on car usage allows for people to meet new people through the carpool service and such things.

A limitaion on car usage would have so many advntages to people and the environment. It helps reduce the amount of pollution from fuel and carbon emissions, helps people save money and not need a car to get to a store or park, and have people become more connected to each other.",0,train_essays,,5
B1D135A74E3D," Dear Mr. Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in exploring the field of teaching through internships and shadowing opportunities. I have always been fascinated by the profession and believe that it is my chance to learn more about it.

One of the reasons why I am drawn to teaching is my desire to make a positive impact on the lives of children. As a teacher, I would have the opportunity to impart knowledge and skills that will help them succeed in their future endeavors. I also believe that education is a crucial aspect of personal and professional growth, and I want to be a part of that process.

Another reason why I want to pursue a career in teaching is because I want to help people achieve their goals. I believe that education is the key to unlocking opportunities and providing a better future for individuals and families. By becoming a teacher, I hope to inspire and motivate students to reach their full potential.

One example of why I am interested in teaching is because of my own experiences as a student. I remember feeling overwhelmed with homework and struggling to understand certain concepts. If I had a teacher who was patient and understanding, I believe that I would have been able to succeed more easily. I want to be that teacher for my students, and provide them with the support and guidance they need to succeed.

In conclusion, I believe that pursuing a career in teaching is the right path for me. I am passionate about the profession and believe that it is my chance to make a positive impact on the lives of others. I hope that you will consider providing me with internships and shadowing opportunities so that I can learn more about the field and explore my options further.

D175411080CC," Extracurricular activities are an essential part of a student's educational experience. Participation in these activities can enrich a student's life and provide them with valuable skills and experiences. However, some students may become so involved in extracurricular activities that they have little time to study or complete homework assignments. As such, schools should limit the number of extracurricular activities that students can participate in.

Research has shown that parents are the best decision-makers when it comes to their children's extracurricular activities. According to a study conducted between 2006 and 2021, 95% of respondents aged 21 to 26 wanted to decide for their children. This shows that parents are willing to make decisions that are in the best interest of their children. Additionally, research from 2010 found that 80% of people prefer to decide for themselves, which shows that students are responsible for their actions and should have the freedom to make their own decisions.

However, too many extracurricular activities can cause students to become overwhelmed and drain their energy. As such, schools should keep track of their students' activities to ensure their safety and health. By doing so, schools can ensure that students are not overworking themselves and are able to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

To address this issue, schools can implement a simple rule where students who participate in three or more extracurricular activities are given 15 to 30 minutes of free time at the end of each class to discuss their progress with their teachers and complete any missing work or assignments. This method has been successful in increasing grades at the University of Mang Totomas in Generic_City, Philippines. A study conducted in 1996 found that students who implemented this rule saw an increase in their grades from an average of 3.0 GPA to 4.1 GPA.

In conclusion, while extracurricular activities are essential for a student's educational experience, too many can cause students to become overwhelmed and drain their energy.

19E57B0657A6,"Summer projects are something that some schools require students to complete. They are given so students may continue to learn, even during their summer break. However, there is a debate whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. While some may argue that a teacher-designed project would give some guidance for the students, others believe that a summer project designed entirely by students would allow students to let them be more creative, students can choose a topic they like, and students can solve a problem they relate to. Summer projects should be entirely student-designed to give students a better learning experience during their break.

First, students can choose a topic that they are interested in for their student project. For example, if a student likes video games, then they would be more motivated to do their project than a summer project with the topic of gardening. The students will be more motivated doing something they like, simply because they enjoy it. No one wants to do a project that no one likes. In addition to that, students may also be more knowledgable in their topic if they are able to design their project. A student could know nothing about gardening and complete a poor project. However, if a student knows everything about video games, then that student can create a very excellent project, because its a topic they like. Student-designed projects allows students to do what they want to do, and have control over it.

Next, with a student-designed project, students can have more freedom in what they want to do. Some students may not like what topic the teacher gives for a project. This can decrease the motivation for some students to do it. However, with a student-designed project, students can be more creative with their project, because people like to learn what they are interested in. Freedom will also make students more motivated to complete their projects, because they are free to do anything.. Freedom can also allow students to be critical thinkers. Some students are the ""go by the book"" students. This means they always follow what they are supposed to do and not think outside the box. Student-designed projects allow students to think differently and not just use what they have always learned in school. Freedom is key for summer projects.

Lastly, students can choose a problem that students relate to. If a projects asks for the solution to a problem, then students can choose a problem that affects them. This would allow students to have a better understanding of the problem and how to solve the problem. It would make students more motivated to try to create a solution, because of how the problem affects them. For example, if a student chooses a topic about global warming, most students know about the dangers associated with global warming, which gives that student a better understanding of the topic. In addition to that, the student would be more motivated in doing their project, because global warming affects that student and everybody else on Earth. Having a problem that students can relate to for a summer project would increase motivation and knowledge of the topic.

Students should be able to design their summer projects to give students a better learning experience. The freedom to do anything, the ability to choose a topic, and solving a relatable problem are all associated with student-designed projects. Student projects will allow students to do whatever they want to do and be motivated. Motivation is the key idea for student-designed projects, because motivation is what drives students to succeed. After school is over, there will be no teacher-designed projects, and for good reason too. Students will have to do things on their own without someone telling them to in life. Student-designed projects are the key to a good education for all students during their summer break.   Â Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
9EADCECA2FB8," I believe that students should be allowed to use their cell phones during passing time and lunch time at school. This would give them the opportunity to relax and unwind, without the fear of having their phones taken away. However, it is important that students are responsible with their phones and put them on vibrate or turn them off when necessary.

One of the main reasons why students need their phones is to stay connected with their families, especially in case of emergencies. If something were to happen to their families, they would need a way to communicate with them. Cell phones are a convenient and efficient way to do this.

Additionally, cell phones are becoming increasingly popular among students. With the availability of new and fancy phones, such as the droid, students are tempted to buy them. While these phones may be expensive, they are also seen as cool and trendy by other students. However, this can also lead to students being mean to others who cannot afford these fancy phones, or using someone's number to bully them.

Overall, I believe that it is important for students to have access to their cell phones during passing time and lunch time, as long as they are responsible with them. This would give them the opportunity to relax and stay connected with their families, while also allowing them to enjoy the latest technology.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

I think the Electoral College would make voting harder. The Electoral College is unfair and votes on its own favor rather than what the people of America think. The reason is because Americans (

The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in the modern sense...it is electors who elect the president,not the people. The Electoral College does not let the majority of candidates votes cast making a difference in voting. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the prsident turned off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

6C045F130B28," In today's world, technology has advanced to a level that has both positive and negative effects on people's lives. From my perspective, I believe that technology has changed the way we live our lives. While technology has slowed down our physical development and stopped us from learning new things, it has also helped us complete tasks more efficiently and save time. Modern technology has had a negative impact on our lives.

One of the most significant negative effects of technology is that it has led to a sedentary lifestyle. People can now access books, shop, and play games without leaving their homes or talking to anyone. This lack of physical activity has slowed down the physical development of our bodies and has led to an increase in obesity rates. According to a recent survey, more than 45% of middle schoolers in the United States have to take medication for vitamin deficiencies because they don't eat their lunches properly due to watching TV or using their phones. Additionally, 38% of middle schoolers have glasses due to sitting in front of TVs or using phones all the time, and more than 46% of students are overweight or underweight due to a lack of physical activity.

Another negative impact of technology is that it has made us dependent on it. We have become so used to relying on technology to complete tasks that we no longer try to do them ourselves or learn how to do them. For example, if our parents didn't stop us from spoon-feeding, we would take it for granted and never learn how to eat on our own.

On the other hand, technology has also helped us complete tasks more efficiently and save time. It has made our lives easier in many ways, allowing us to complete tasks 50% faster than we would have been able to do on our own. For instance, our group had an assignment to complete by Friday, and thanks to modern technology, we were able to finish it in just three days instead of the two weeks it would have taken if we had to read books to find the information we needed.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on our lives. While it has brought both positive and negative effects, it is essential to use it wisely. We must be mindful of how and when we use technology to ensure that it has a positive impact on our lives. By using technology less, we can maintain a",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

While exploring Venus presents clear dangers, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a compelling case that its study remains worthwhile. The extreme environment of Venus provides valuable insights that can further scientific understanding. Through explaining the challenges and benefits of Venus research, the author adequately supports pursuing this avenue of discovery despite the risks involved.

A key part of the author's argument focuses on the lessons to be learned from Venus's surface and atmosphere. Its crushing atmosphere of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds survive temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Untangling how such hostile conditions arose has implications for understanding climate change and potential habitability on other planets. Moreover, the author notes Venus may hold clues about the early evolution of terrestrial planets like Earth. Its similarities in size and composition to our planet make comparisons particularly informative. 

The dangers involved with exploring Venus are not downplayed. The article details how past missions quickly succumbed to the planet's harsh environment. Future options would require vast technological advances to withstand such hellish conditions on the surface and in the skies above. However, the potential scientific value derived from studying a ""twin"" of the Earth that diverged onto a starkly different path outweighs these challenges according to the author. With care and innovation, much could be learned to unravel long-standing questions about the formation and meteorology of rocky worlds.

In summation, the author builds a persuasive case for continuing Venus exploration through weighing both its risks and rewards. Despite posing clear dangers, studying our nearest planetary neighbor provides a unique opportunity to deepen understanding across several fields of science. With mission success relying on creative solutions, the pursuit of Venus remains a worthy goal for furthering human knowledge of the cosmos.",1,darragh_claude_v7,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

C1AD06518697,"The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads one point six million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from texting and driving. Texting while driving is something that people have done in the past, they are doing it today, and are still going to do it in the future. No matter how people are injured or have lost their lives to this people are still going to do it. Some of the main reasons that you should not text while driving is because; you can cause serious accidents that way, you are more likely to be blamed for causing the accident and it is illegal to be on the phone in some states.

According to a new study talking on the phone is hugely dangerous even if you are on hands free. There are thousands of people who get into accidents everyday because they were not paying attention to the road. They were to busy looking down at their phones to notice what was going on around them. If you are paying attention to what you are doing you can only injure yourself but you can also injure another person as well.

Most likely if you are texting while driving and end up getting into an accident then you are most likely to get blamed than the other person. There is a high chance of it being your fault because you were not paying attention to the road. Yow will also probably get charged by your insurance company and have to pay more if the other person decides to file a lawsuit against you. Being distracted for even one minute can change a whole lot and make a big difference.

Even though it may not be illegal in Georgia right now, one day it could become illegal for people to drive and talk on the phone. In the state of Missouri people under the age of 21 can not talk and drive at the same time. It is against the law because they are not of age to be trusted to talk and text while driving. They are at a high risk more than anyone else to get into an accident because they are underage teenagers who do not know how to stay off their phone.

Most car accidents are caused by people who think that they can drive and pay attention to the road while also doing something else. The main people who think that they can do that are the main ones that get into the most accidents and get the most tickets. Texting while driving is dangerous for you and for the people around you. That is why sometimes people say you have to drive for the people around you. You never know what someone is doing in there car and whether they are paying attention or not. They also have to do the same for you if you are not paying attention to the road and what you are doing.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

69BC1F85E051,"The author of ""The Challenge of exploring Venus."" Did a bad job of supporting his claims that we should study venus despites the danger that presents. His information was plentyful it gaves us a good idea on what he believes and whats happening to further their opinion. Unfourtanely it didn't provide us with enough good follow up supports.

First off with his first and second reasons being astronmers are fascinated by Venus due to the possiblity of it being it earth like previously and thats its still has some earth like features. This is stated in paragraph four as it states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" and ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Despite these good points he doesn't further it more in paragraph four he only states that it can be our nearest option for a plantary which adds nothing to the claim and isn't a good follow up of what they said previously.

His third reason is in paragraph 8 the last paragraph and it is""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. this is a really good claim but the author only follows it up wih human curiosty will just lead us into equally intimidating endaevors which adds pretty much nothing in regards to his claim. Paragrph 8 is the final paragraph and its a horrible placement to put your final reasoning.

Overall the author reasons are good but it lacks any follow up support to back it up. While giving information for context is great the author over did it and it took up the majority of the paragraphs leaving no room to put some of their reasons in more early paragraphs to catch the readers attention. Many follow up to their reasons added nothing to the authors claim making it usless information. It wouldn't have been so bad if the author hade made it less an info dump and more reasoning to help their claim.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

BF07A20CFE46,"After reading the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" I developed my own opinion on driverless cars. My opinion on driverless cars is that I agree with the development of driverless cars, because it seems like a good idea and I believe that they are something that people would want to buy. The article features plenty of information to support my claim including why driverless cars are a good idea and how they will help us in our everyday lives.

The first piece of evidence in favor of driverless cars comes from the information that ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" The fact that Google has been working on driverless cars for so long proves that driverless cars are a good idea. This is because if Google has been working on this technology for the past seven years then that means that they have been constantly improving their product and that it is pretty far into it's development period. That means that the cars are able to be manufactored pretty well at this point even if they're not perfect, which helps to prove that with that much work done on it the cars have many improvements from the original product and will be easier to manufactor and sell in the future.

Computer-driven cars have been in production or at least an idea in some of the major car companies minds since as early as the 1950s. Sensors that use computer information to stop or control the car have been worked on since the 1980s. Since driverless cars or computer-driven cars have been an idea for so long then it means that they probably will continue to remain an idea that companies will try and harness. If the idea and development related to the idea has been going on since the 1950s there is almost not doubt that it will not stop being studied and developed. If it can last sixty years, then it probably will not disappear anytime soon. Driverless cars are here to stay.

Driverless cars also show the ability to assess the situation therefore giving them a better chance of being able to stop accidents before they happen. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accident."" The ability to assess the situation and inform the driver is a very important feature. This may also be helpful in preventing car accidents and the injurys or deathes that occur from them. Since the driverless car has safety precautions it makes it a good choice for on the road and proving once again that development for these cars should continue.

Four states have already approved the limited use of driverless cars. ""California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have lead the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars."" This information helps to prove that the idea that the idea of driverless cars is slowly but surely being accepted. California and Florida are large states that have a large population and get a lot of tourists every year. Nevada contains Los Vegas, another huge city, and is a place where a lot of people got to gamble. Finally the District of Columbia houses some of the most important buildings and artifacts of the American government. These are all states that mean a big deal, and since they have accepted driverless cars that means that they could spread extremely quickly to the other states. If some of the biggest most populated and most important states can accept the cars then that means that the bettle is almost won and is proof that driverless cars are a good idea.

Most car companies are jumping on the bandwagon and are beginning to work on making driverless cars. The ones that are mentioned expect to have driverless cars avaible in the next five years. Large scale car companies like Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and Nissan are all planning on releasing cars. This means that those large scale companies have realized that driverless cars are a good idea and they do not want to miss out. Those mass producers usually do not plan on manufactoring something unless they believe it will make a decent profit. By saying that they are going to work on these cars these companies are saying that they believe that driverless cars happen to be something that they believe a lot of consumers will want to buy. This proves that driverless cars are a good idea because it means that people are interested in them and believe that they are a good idea.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
E5B3346016BA," A POSITIVE MINDSET IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN LIFE

A positive mindset is the key to success in life? Attitude is a behavior that people possess, and it can be seen through their actions. While a person may be born without a positive mindset, parents play a crucial role in shaping their child's mindset. A positive mindset is the key to success in life, as it allows individuals to navigate different personalities and situations with ease.

First, a positive mindset is the key to success in life because it allows individuals to connect with others and inspire them. People are drawn to those who are optimistic and enthusiastic about life. For example, in a classroom, students from different backgrounds may have different personalities, but a teacher with a positive mindset can bring out the best in each student, making them feel valued and motivated to learn.

Secondly, a positive mindset is the key to success in life because it enables individuals to see opportunities where others see only obstacles. People with a positive mindset are more likely to take risks and pursue their goals, even in the face of challenges. For instance, entrepreneurs with a positive mindset are more likely to start successful businesses, as they see the potential in every opportunity that comes their way.

Nevertheless, some people argue that a positive mindset is not the key to success in life. They argue that success is determined by hard work and perseverance, regardless of one's mindset. While hard work and perseverance are essential for success, having a positive mindset can make the journey to success more fulfilling and enjoyable. A positive mindset can help individuals stay motivated, focused, and resilient in the face of setbacks and failures.

In conclusion, a positive mindset is the key to success in life because it allows individuals to connect with others, see opportunities where others see obstacles, and stay motivated and focused on their goals.

Having an idea of what connects the students to each other they are given the opportunityÂ to create plans and project ideas around how others learn, with them being students themselves and having a sense of how their peers work it makes it easier to come up with these project ideas. This allows them to gain social skills, get a better understanding of the project, and how to properly execute the task at hand.

Also, allowing them to design the project gives them a sense of responsibility, the chance to show how to be a leader and to show their maturity level as well as how well they work when it comes to group or individual activities especially projects.

First off, limiting car usage would reduce greenhouse gases. Our cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and fifty percent in car areas in the United States. That is an unbelievable percentage of greenhouse gases in Europe and an unreal percentage here in the United States. Lowering that percent would be great and alot of people would be thankful, and that would be an advantage of limiting car usage around the world.

Another advantage of limiting car usage would be lowering stress and at the same time lowering pollution. If you limit car usage and just stop driving a car, grab your bike and go for a nice bike ride, it would be a good thing if you are stressed out, it will take your mind off of things and allow you to ease the stress and just relax, and while your not even thinking about it, you wouldn't be polluting the air because your on a bicycle. That is another great advantage towards limiting car usage.

Also limiting car usage would make cities denser, and allow more walking room for people to walk around instead of having to dodge vehicles. If we limit car usage, we could probably build and make more parks where people could walk and exercise, but if we have alot of vehicles driving around, how could we do that.

851CDCC848DF,"Growing up, we have all had to deal with the dreaded summer projects. With everyone rushing at the end of summer trying to finish them before school starts. What if you were given the opportunity to choose your project? The project would be more open to ideas rather than stuck on one topic. Summer projects should be student-designed because it motivates them to get their projects done, it allows students to express their interests, and it betters the all around process as well as the scores. This different approach can bring a whole new side to summer learning.

To begin, making these projects student-designed can motivate the students more than an assigned topic. Most students procrastinate when it comes to projects assigned over summer break because they aren't trilled on the topic or aspect. The last thing they want to do on their break from school is write a paper on a book they don't prefer. By letting the students explore their own ideas, they will put more time and energy into the project rather than brushing it off. However, this isn't the only positiveÂ aspect to this approach.

Additionally, students will get to express their interests through their projects. When students get to choose their topics they usually tend to choose things that inspire or interest them. Giving students more room to work with can open their minds to new ideas. By assigning a straight forward project, you are taking away all of the creativity. Naturally, a student will put more thought into something they know more about or care more about. While many people would agree with this idea, it is not always seen this way.

Teachers and adults may say that letting students choose their projects is out of line and a lot of extra work to grade. However, giving the students freedom of expression can better the all around process as well as the grading aspect. They can pick their own topics while still working from the teachers guide lines, making the grading process relatively the same. Grading projects that were more thought out is a lot better than grading poorly done projects that the students didn't truly care about. In addition to all of these positive points, there are many more that support.

In conclusion, freedom to express interests, motivation to get things done, and bettering the all around process and scores are all reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. If you work at a school that assigns these summer projects or even if you just agree with this position, take a stand. You can open up a whole new way of teaching. This small change in summer learning can make a big change in education.

Dear TEACHER_NAME;

I feel that you should require all students to do at least some community work. The community needs volunteers, and what better candidates than the able-bodied students right here in this school? I know a lot of kids don't want to ""waste their time"" with such trivial odd-jobs, but they really aren't trivial at all. They don't realize it, but they could be making a big difference in someone's life. I don't know how many times I've heard that we were put here to help others, and i know a lot of other kids have heard it, too. Well, this is our chance to help those others. This is our chance to brighten up somebody's day. This is our chance to make a difference.

Serving the community gives students a sense of accomplishment, and makes them feel like they really are contributing good things to the world. In other words, it makes the students feel good. It feels good to help people, and when you get to do it as a group, with your classmates, it makes it even better! No one really realizes how much help just a couple of kids can give until they actually try. I say we let them have the chance to find out. I think that everyone should get the chance to serve their community. I know everybody has the option, but this might be the first time they've ever seriously thought about giving it a try. I believe we should open up that opportunity to everyone.

In conclusion, yes. I do believe that students should be required to do some community service. It's really not a waste of time if you actually put your heart into it. All options should be open for everybody, and i think that this is a great chance to do some good. Some students might even base their careers off of what they learn while serving the community. You never know where it'll lead when you give someone a chance to try, but you can bet the outcome will be good.

D5C8C29F17D8,"As an 8th grader, I have often wondered about the benefits of attending school versus completing schoolwork at home. While some students may prefer the comfort of their own homes, others may thrive in a structured school environment. After conducting research and exploring different options available for students who cannot attend school, I have come to realize that both scenarios have their own advantages and disadvantages.

On one hand, attending school provides students with a social atmosphere that can enhance their learning experience. Being around peers and teachers can stimulate discussion and collaboration, which can lead to better understanding and retention of material. Additionally, schools often offer various extracurricular activities and clubs that can help students develop their interests and talents. For example, joining a sports team or music club can help students develop teamwork and leadership skills, respectively.

On the other hand, completing schoolwork at home can offer students more flexibility and autonomy in their learning. Students can work at their own pace and take breaks whenever they need to, which can be especially helpful for those who have different learning styles or have difficulty concentrating in a classroom setting. Moreover, students can access online resources and tools that can provide personalized learning experiences tailored to their needs.

For students who cannot attend school due to various reasons, such as illness or disability, there are different options available. Online schools and homeschooling programs can provide a structured learning environment that is tailored to the individual student's needs. These programs can offer flexibility and personalized attention that may not be possible in a traditional classroom setting.

However, there are also major differences between attending school and completing schoolwork at home. In a classroom setting, students can receive immediate feedback and support from teachers, which can help them stay on track with their education. Additionally, teachers can provide real-time feedback and guidance, which can help students improve their understanding and performance. In contrast, completing schoolwork at home can be more isolating, and students may struggle to stay motivated and focused without the structure and support of a classroom environment.

E7510A2A4F0A,"Hey, so like, I know that knowledge is super important for, like, success in life and stuff. I mean, think about it, without knowledge, we wouldn't be able to do anything. Like, we wouldn't be able to build things, or help people, or even figure out how to make pizza. (I know, I know, it's a basic, but it's a good example).

So, like, when we have knowledge, we can use it to create things that are, like, really cool and helpful. For instance, scientists have knowledge about the world and how it works, so they can invent new medicines and technologies that make our lives better. Or, like, artists have knowledge about colors and shapes and stuff, so they can create beautiful paintings and sculptures that make us feel emotions.

But it's not just about creating things, knowledge can also help us help others. Like, if we know how to do CPR, we can save someone's life. Or, like, if we know how to speak a different language, we can communicate with people from different cultures and help them.

And, like, the best part is that knowledge is never ending. There's always more to learn, more to discover, more to explore. So, even when we think we know everything, there's still so much more to learn and experience.

So, in conclusion, knowledge is super important for success in life. It helps us create things, assist others, and learn new things every day. So, like, make sure you're always learning and growing, because it's never too late to start.

01F899239821,"Cell phones are very dangerous in today's time. Did you know that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction that driving under the influence of alcohol? Did you know that it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car? Did you know that having your cell phone in your hand is illegal in today's time? I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.

To start off, there are several things that could happen if you choose to use your cell phone while driving. You could run off the road, you could hit someone else's car, or you could hit an actual person. You never know what could happen if you choose to pick up your phone. You should consider other motorists. You should consider protecting the pedestrians. You should consider your passengers. You should defiantly consider yourself.

Using your cell phone while driving is something that you shouldn't do. You never know what other lives you could affect just because you want to use your phone. Maybe you think, it will just be for a few seconds to text someone back but in those few seconds your life can change tremendously. It only takes a few seconds to park your car. Instead of taking your own life and someone else's in those few seconds, you can park your car and then use your phone. The vehicles can be replaced but the people inside those vehicles can't.

Finally, using your phone while driving is illegal. If you choose to use your phone, you are going to end up having to pay a ticket, living with the regret of hurting other people around you and living with pain because of the minute you needed on your phone. Whoever you think you must respond to or look at, would much rather you make it to your destination in one piece then responding to their text or call.

That person would want you to wait until you are parked than to take someone else's life and your own.

In conclusion, it all comes down to using your phone while driving or not. I hope you always remember that one text, call, or scroll is not worth it. Keep your eyes on the road and always give behind the wheel, all your effort. No one wants to get into a car wreck, sometimes it does happen but don't let the reason of it be, you are using your phone. I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
743B458B5D2B,"Students that are currently enrolled in schools have been the generation to grow up with new technological advances and harder school programs. With this, distance schooling is not a crazy idea and it may even allow for students to do better and acheive more. As a student currently enrolled in a multitude of AP or DE classes, I can agree that distance learning may be a good source for students that can't attend school for whatever reason. With distance learning students will be able to better their education when they are sick and need to take leave, need a bit of extra help outside of the classroom, and finally for students that have mental disorders or are diseases that limit their ability to go out.

In many cases, espicially in high school, students will avoid missing school when they are sick becasue the benefit of staying home to heal from sickness does not exceed the cost of missing school. High school classes hand out tremendous amounts of work that pile up on students: if students were to miss one day it would turn into weeks of work. Due to the excessive amounts of work, the majority of students prefer to tough it out and go to school. Since students are going to school ill, this provides the oppertunity for students to contaminate the school leaving others at risk of becoming sick. If distance learning was an option it would limit the exposure of sick individuals to the general school population. With distance learning students would then be able to watch videos or online conference with their teachers so that they don't miss anything important during class.

Another benefit that distance learning may have is the ability for students to gain extra help. For many students the learning pace during school is too fast and hard to keep up with, but with the use of distance learning students would be able to watch videos at home or conference privately with their teachers. Along with a fast learning pace, some students may feel embaressed or shy during class and don't like asking questions. Through online video conferencing students can ask their teachers one on one questions privately. Some people believe that if a student doesn't understand a lesson or can't ask questions during class that its their own fault and should have to deal with it on their own by getting a tutor. Although tutors are an excellent tool, they are costly and some students may have to work after school or play sports leaving them no time for extra help outside of school. Through distance learning students can access the extra help they need by opening there laptop to watch a video compared to spending excess amounts of money and time on a tutor.

Finally, distance learning would be able to help those that can't attend school, physically or mentally. Today in society more than a fourth of the population suffers from some sort of mental or physical disorder which limits the way they preform during school.

I know a number of poeple that suffer from a disorder like Anxiety or ADHD and can't preform well during school and have to wait to get home to complete their work. Since these students can't focus in a busy environment, like the classroom, they don't learn during class and have to teach themselves the lesson at home. Since they are teaching themselves the material they often miss information or the inforamtion is wrong.

For students that have physcial disabilities or diseases and can't leave there home or the hospital, they would still be able to learn like a ""normal"" student in a classroom setting.Â With the use of distance learning these students would be able to watch videos and conference with teachers to help learn and improve their education.

People may believe that with distance learning comes a big price tag attached. However the cost of ditsance learning shouldn't be too high. Most students and staff have access to a computer or some sort of technology that will provide them the oppertunity to watch videos online or video conference with a teacher. Through distance learning it gives students so many advantages that were not provided to the older generations including allowing students to learn at home when they are sick, giving students the oppertunity to receive extra help, and finallly granting students with diseases and disorders the ability to learn in a classroom settting. With the use of distance learning it would provide students with resources that other generations never had to help better their quality of education.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Some students may think that it would be awful for this because they may not want them to know how they are feeling, but others may think its great. In some classroom computers you could put these Facial Action Coding Systems and it could potnetialy help students but changing up a lesson if it is confusng or irritateing you. Others though may think that the system would be of no help and think that students may still struggle.

Therefor if the system was added to computers it could help students learn better by changing lessons if it is confusing. The computer could regonize if you are having a hard time and then the computer could change the lesson up by making it easier to understnad. Also the computer could regonize if you are bored or not and if it sinced boredom it could change the lesson by making it more exciting to learn. The computers with Facial Action Coding Systems may be of use to students and teachers because it may help teacher to know what they need to help students with, but also it could help the studetns by making the lessons they do easier and funner to learn and understand. Last the Facial Action Coding System may be useful in all classroom settings because it could be of some use to help students get better grades overall.

In addition to that it could help students that struggle to stay focused with certain things. It could help the students by making lessons that are more eye fetching making them try and stay focused. Also the computer could change the lesson by giving them something interesting to learn about instead of just giving them a lesson that may be causing them to not stay focused. Although the FACS may not always be able to please everyone it can try to do its best at providing the best lessons to each indiviual student.

The FACS may be able to provide the best type of lesson to the student that is sitting at the computer. The FACS may be the thing that could change everything. It could help students understand and pass lessons that they may have been previosuly struggleing with. It could give students the second chance they need bacause maybe they have to repeat something because they didn't pass, but if the FACS change the lesson t obe modified to there personal lesson that it could change the way they learn by helping them pass. All together th FACS would be a good choice to put into computers that are in a classroom.

FACS would be amazing for studetns that struggle with a lot of different things. They could work at their own pace so that they could understand better and so that maybe the FACS could change the lesson to make it understandable and easy to learn. It could help students pass there lessons and exams by helping them learn the material better. Also FACS could be the deciding factor between wether you pass or not because you could just not understand the material and fail or with FACS you could get lessons changed that you don't understand and pass. In conclusion FACS would be great to put into computers that are in a classroom setting.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
FB850FF64304,"Cell phones while driving

Cell phones while driving is one of the biggest issues that we have today. Everyone has a cell phone so more than likely it's in there hand 24/7, When it goes off while they are driving they automatically think that they have to check it right then and there no matter if it is a message, social media, or even a phone call. Cell phones while driving should be stopped for the safety of the people on the roads and even your own life. No matter if you can drive and be on the phone, think of the others that you are putting in danger.

When you get notifications you have to look down for quite some time, It is dangerous to type and read while on the road so why put yourself and others life at risk. While you are reading or even texting you are putting all of your thought into the conversation that you are not focused on the road. You could be texting or looking at your phone and slowly losing control of the car which could easily cause a car crash that you could have avoided just by paying attention to the road.

Making phone calls while driving are dangerous as well. I understand that you could be busy and have important calls coming in or even going out, but they can truly wait until you come to a stop or even make it to your destination. There should be absolutely no reason to pick up or even have your phone in your hand whatsoever. If the call is really important then you can pull over from where you are and answer the phone at least try to think about others on the road

A call or even a text can wait until you get to where you are going, ,cell phones should not be allowed while you are driving. Be aware of everyone's safety not just yours. Think of all the things that I just said and take them into consideration. Others may say that being on the phone while driving is not bad if you know what you are doing but why take a risk at something that you can avoid.

A3C528075F41,"Dear principal,

I have realized that you are thinking that students are required to do community service.

What i think you should do is make them do community service. It be a great learning experience. Kids like myself would learn true values of being helpful and also learn respect.

They might not like it at first, but eventually through time they will become better students.

Kids grades might improve by learning true values of respect and education. Every day most kids in about 53.7% don't have good grades and this could make that percentage go down. Just think better grades also means more money for the school.

I think that you should have kids do community service. i know it makes me feel good inside the work itself seeing people smile is the greatest reward of all. The kids hopefully will like that just as much as me. That in itself is why the kids should do community service. I know you will make the right decision, good luck and be grateful.

6180C9A37B2B,"Dear principle,

I think it is a good idea to make students do some community service. Some people around here need help and if we do this we could help very many families around the state. After school at least 3 times a week we can help a family or person in need.

Kids think that doing this is stupid and they shouldn't have to, but we all need to step up and help out the community. We could give away toys, clothes, and anything else we don't want, don't need, or could be helpful to someone else. Or we could send out ten people to go to every school in the county and read books to people in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade. Some of us can work in a soup kitchen whenever they are free.

Maybe sometime we can have an assembly at our school and we can hire a public speaker to tell us about how helping the community can help us and everyone else! This could be a great idea. And remember it only takes a few people to make a difference! Thank you and have a great day!

5562FD4D4820,"Some people think it is important to get more than one idea when trying to come up with something. So IÂ amÂ going to list the pros and cons to that. Do you think that getting more than one idea is important.

One pro is that you get lots of other ideas from asking people. So for example if you ask 15 people to help you with making a decision then you have many other ideas. You can also use all of the informationÂ they gave you to make one bigger idea. And they you can all get together and all come up with one idea.

But the con to that is that you have a bigger decision to make. For example if you get 15 different peoples ideas and there nothing alike your going to have to decide whos ideas gets thrown out. If some ideas are just bad then that make that easy but most of the ideas are probably going to be pretty good. So your just sat there with most likely around 12 or 13 ideas and you dont know whos to pick.

But the second pro is that all the time doctors use this strategy to narrow down a sickness/injury someone has. And most the time it works out and they get rid of a view possibility. And when they do use this it lets them find it out faster and get to work right away sometimes it just takes five minutes and they get the idea and its right and they save them. For example one time my brother was in the hospital and they didnt know what was wrong with him but thought shearing ideas they found out what was wrong with him.

But the con to that is sometimes that just throws them off. For example one time there was just someone at the hospital normal and doctors are trying to findÂ out whats wrong but because they disagreed so much they got in a argument. Another example is that one doctor might think its the flu and the other could think its the corona virus and they might start screaming at each other. Or a final example is that they think is two different things and instead of getting mad trying to prove there point they just sit there confused.

I think that sometimes shearing ideas with others can help but other times it cant. If its something personal then just keep it to your self. But if its like what the doctors do then you should ask for help. And if someone ask you for help then dont be rude you probably should help them out and make there day better.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Hello , my name is STUDENT_NAME. I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME. I've heard that you were changing the school policy , and that you wanted to hear from the students. I would love for you to take the chance to read my letter . Thank You

As I stated before I've heard about the changes you want to make and I have a lot of suggestion on it . One of them is that may be after school programs is the only way some of the students stay out of trouble. So then with you taking that away from them, they will have nothing else to do . Then they will turn to the streets, and i know you wouldn't want that for our fellow students .

Also may be them getting a C grade average is the best they can do. Then our school wouldn't have the best after school activities we could have. Then the people who enjoy it the most , but doesn't meet the standard wouldn't have the ability to get a scholar ship in it even if they need it the most. Another reason is that, without after school activities students wouldn't really be able to work out. Then we would have even more students turning obesity.

I would really like to thank you for reading my letter and giving my suggestions a thought . I hope you really think about them. Also and try not to just take our activities for granted. Once again thank you.

f3914f7c,"""All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.

To start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of nearrecord pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.

Next, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay 40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih evennumbered license plates could drive one day and oddnumbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota's carfree day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.

To conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.",0,train_essays,,8
33b61c93,"Dear State Senator, In my opinion, Im in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. At first I was all for keeping the Electoral College. But after reading the reasons why we shouldn't keep it I completly agree that we should change it.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" So basically the electoral college doesn't give a fair chance to voters and that's not right. All voters in every state should get a fair chance. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!"" ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" Which once again is not fair and isn't right. If people are taking the time to vote then they're the ones who should be picking who the president is. Not the electors. ""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we migh call the disaster factor. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This is an example: ""In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe."" Those are a couple great reasons and examples why you should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States instead of keeping the Electoral College.",0,train_essays,,5
985FC4A0FAE2," Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, as more schools are offering the option for students to attend classes from home through online or video conferencing. I believe that this is a positive development because it offers a variety of benefits for students who may not be able to attend classes in person due to various reasons.

Firstly, distance learning allows students to attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which can be especially beneficial for those who have other responsibilities such as work or family obligations. This means that they can balance their studies with other commitments, without having to sacrifice one for the other.

Secondly, distance learning offers a flexible schedule, which can be tailored to the individual needs of each student. This means that students can attend classes at a time that suits them best, whether that be early in the morning, during the day, or in the evening.

Thirdly, distance learning can provide a more personalized learning experience for students. With online classes, students can interact with their teachers and classmates in a more intimate setting, which can lead to more meaningful discussions and relationships.

Fourthly, distance learning can be a more cost-effective option for students. This is because it eliminates the need for transportation, housing, and other expenses associated with attending classes in person.

Finally, distance learning can be a great option for students who may not have access to certain courses or programs at their local school. With online classes, students can take courses from anywhere in the world, which can broaden their educational horizons and provide them with new opportunities.

In conclusion, I believe that distance learning is a valuable option for students who may not be able to attend classes in person.

One of the primary benefits is an individual's mental well-being; those who approach life with a positive frame of mind are more likely to remain calmer and better equipped to handle stress. Additionally, a person with a positive attitude is a lot more appealing to others, increasing the likelihood they will build strong relationships with the people around them. 

On the contrary, there are those who believe a positive attitude is not required in order to succeed. However, studies have demonstrated that having a positive attitude can have a significant impact on the decisions an individual makes throughout their life. People who cultivate a positive outlook on life are more likely to pursue educational and career opportunities, helping them to reach a greater level of success. Moreover, finding the opportunity to learn from every situation can create a lasting advantage in areas such as problem-solving and creativity. 

To conclude, having a positive attitude in everyday life can have immense positive consequences.

831F54B2B19D,"Would like to be in your bed during the school day? Well some schools make that possible for kids, by letting them take their classes from their houses. Personally, I think that would be a great thing; but for somebody who has a tough time pay attention at school, I am sure that I would not be able to focus at home. I know that many kids are like me in that sense, kids shouldn't be able to go to school at home. The reasons why people shouldn't be going to school at home is because, they would get distracted very often, people would be anti-social, kids might be to comfortable, and that their is a high chance that kids would forget their work a great deal of the time.

Kids in my generationÂ seem to have a great deal of attention problems, so I find it very likely that many kids would have a extremely hard time keeping on task while going to school at home. Many kids at my school have ADD or ADHD which affects their ability to focus, and that causes them to be disruptive and of task during the school day. So for those kids having to take classes at home would lead to them having worse grades. Also around 3 quarters of the people in my school seem to have a pet of some kind, and that would make it very hard to concentrate, especially if the pet likes to be around people at all times.

Another big reason for why kids shouldn't take classes at home is that it makes them be anti-social, because kids spend around 7 hours a day at school, which is where they get most of their social interaction. If people aren't going to school it is going to be very hard for people to make friends and be social. For example, I know somebody who goes to a very small private school that has around 60 kids in it (and around 6 in his grade), which limits their social activity their and they have a really hard time making friends where he lives.

A large reason for not taking classes at home, is that it might be a little to comfortable. People being comfortable is not a bad thing but in can be, people siting on their couch might not be a bad thing for one or two class periods, but if they are siting there 7 hours a day uninterrupted would be a very bad thing. Schools make kids walk between classes instead of teachers because of teachers need to keep all their stuff set up like in a Chem classroom, or they make kids move around to regain focus and get their blood flowing around their bodies again. Schools also get hard plastic chairs for kids to sit in so that they will stay awake, because the chairs are uncomfortable, and can be very cold.

Kids also would forget about work if they took classes online. Teachers in schools give out paper copies of homework or notes which many kids find to be very helpful with not forgetting about the homework or helpful studying, because they have the paper with them. But if people where going to class online they would have to go and print out a worksheet or take their notes online which would be hard for many people. For example, if one of the kids from my school with ADD/ADHD was to forget to print out a homework assignment or print out notes they took online, they would have a very hard time studying on the computer without going on to another website that is not for school.

Their are some positive things about taking online classes. Like people dont have to leave their house if they need to take care of somebody, like a grandparent. People also have the ability to be comfortable, which isn't a bad thing if it is in little sections and the person gets up and moves. There would also be no/minimal snow days or sick days, which many people would think would be a bad thing but your school year would end earlier.

Even with all of the positives to taking onlineÂ classes, the negatives still out way them. So people shouldn't be taking online classes, for the reasons that kids would have to many distractions, would anti-social, they would be to comfortable, and they would forget work to often.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

The first reason that the FACS system is valuable is that it could help students learn. D'Alto quotes Dr. Huang when he says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it coud modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""(D'Alto 6). This technology would make sure that every student has the help they need if they are confused. D'Alto also says ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive -- for video games or video surgury""(D'Alto 6). The FACS could be used for medical training as well as every day learning.

Secondly, the FACS could be used for politics. In the article D'Alto states "" The can even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.""(D'Alto 7). This applies to politics, because politions who are ingenuine would be easily caught. D'Alto furthurs this thinking by saying ""these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" polititian or celeberty isn't being truthful.""(D'Alto 8). This shows that this field of study is already applied to politics, but that the FACS will only inporove our ability spot the fakers.

Lastly, this technology could be used for entertainment purposes. D'Alto mentions that mimicking facial expression is used in the acting world. D'A;to say that an acting coach has his actors ""carefully reproduce smiling and frowning faces as a way of creating these emotions on stage.""(D'Alto 9). The FACS could help these actors more accuratly display the emotions their characters are feeling. Another way D'Alto says FACS could impove entertainment is by saying ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games""(D'Alto 6). Making the characters in video games more expressive would have the same affect as making actors expressions more accurate. It creates a sense of realism and emersion to the audience, thus inproving the experience as a whole.

In conclusion I believe the FACS system could be very valuable in many ways.

It can help students study, call out fake celeberties or polititians, or make entertainment better.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
9613CEAFE86E,""" Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? In my opinion i think we as people accomplish a lot if we are always doing something. One reason is because in oder to do something or succeed in something you have to be doing something for that to happen. I feel like if people want something to get done you have make a change and stay determined just like what Thomas Jefferson said in his quote and that's very important to keep in mind when you are trying to achieve something and you wanna make a difference.

In Thomas Jefferson's quote he says something that really makes you think about how in society today how people deal with some things. It makes you wonder if people are doing the most they can to accomplish something and it also makes you think to yourself if you as your own person are doing whatever is it you can to accomplish your goals in life. I feel like some people don't do anything to try to accomplish the set goals they have for themselves and they expect for that goal that they are waiting for to come to them instead of them working for that accomplishment. It shouldnt be that way but some people think life is like that also when there is a major issue going on in the world some people think that doing nothing is okay. When people witness a problem some people decide not to do anything and the issue will go away when maybe that's not the case in some situations.

There are people that are dedicated to what they want and will always do something to accomplish or achieve whatever it is they need to achieve and i think that is really good because it just shows that you are determined to do whatever you can to get what you want in life. People that are very determined achieve so much that it inspires others and makes them feel like they need to do something so they can start achieving want they want in life. I feel like that's very important because if you dont do something to accomplish what you want then nothing is going to happen in your life and I know there are people that don't do anything and they have nothing good going for them.

I feel like Thomas Jefferson was the type of person to stay determined and focused on the goals he wanted to make. He set goals and he made them happen he made things happen for our country and all that happend because he was determined and focused and he wanted to do something so he can accomplish what he wanted. Everything in life you have to work for it and do something about it. It doesnt just land in your lap everything you do requires you to work for it and the end result will be that you accomplished everything you worked hard for. For example I feel like a lot of issues in this world could be solved if people would do something people wouldnt be running for there lives because there is a war going on in there country if somebody would do something about it. There wouldnt be so much negativity and so much hatred if somebody would just make a change.

My over all conclusion about this quote that Thomas Jefferson wrote is that it is important for people to actually do something and work hard and achieve there goal. When you put your all into something your hard work pays off and you finally accomplished something and that's all that matters. I feel like what message Thomas Jefferson is trying to give is that life is always gonna be hard no matter what but you always have to push yourself and accomplish what needs to be done. When you do that good things come in return and it does serve purpose in you life it always have and always will. I think that is what Thomas Jefferson is trying to say in his motivating quote and it really inspired me and i hope it inspires others as well.",0,original_moth,"Task:

F06D9612B900,"Hey, I'm so excited to write this essay about the two cool science experiments I conducted! ð¬ð¸ð¡

Okay, so the first experiment I did was on the interior of a frog. I know, I know, it sounds kind of gross, but trust me, it was actually really cool! ð I caught a frog from our backyard and carefully removed its skin. Then, I examined its insides and saw all these tiny organs and stuff inside! It was like a little frog body museum! ðï¸ I even found its heart, which was beating away like crazy! ð¥ It was so neat to see how all the different parts of the frog worked together to keep it alive.

Next, I moved on to the flashlight and liquid experiment. This one was way more fun! ð¡ð¥ I filled a glass with water and added a few drops of food coloring. Then, I shined a flashlight through the water and watched as the light made the colors dance around! It was like magic! ð© I tried different angles and positions, and the colors changed depending on where the light hit. It was so cool to see how the light could manipulate the colors in such a cool way.

So, what did I learn from these experiments? Well, I learned that science is super cool and can be really fun! ð¤© I mean, who knew that you could learn so much just by looking at a frog's insides or playing with light and colors? ð¨ It made me realize that there's so much more to science than just memorizing facts and figures. It's all about exploring and discovering new things, and I can't wait to do more experiments and see what else I can learn! ð¬ð

In conclusion, doing science experiments is a blast! ð It's a great way to learn about the world around us and to discover new things. So, if you haven't tried it yet, definitely give it a shot!

8DF5D7CF4085,"Everywhere you go, everyone or at least someone makes a plan for their future reference or goal. Many people don't have the time to accomplish their goal and others have. Everyone has a way to achieve or succeed in something they like. Others like to stay idle or not tend to move to achieve their goal. And other people like to do something to accomplish their goal. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I totally agree to Thomas Jefferson's statement that, we accomplish more if we are doing something.

To start with, doing something can help you plan, achieve, or complete your future goal quicker.

For example, When you are given a task to complete you can't sit there idle to wait for someone to help you or wait for a magic to happen to complete your goal. If you want to graduate from high school and get to college with a scholarship, you will have to study hard to get to college. If you want to get a great permanent job, you still have to study hard and have a good resume. This will make you be faster with every work you be given to complete.

Furthermore, doing something always makes you more active. For instance, when you fail an exam or possibly one or too many of them, you can't possibly say that you do not care about your score, you have to take action, study hard, and hope for the next exams you would make it to the top. Whenever I fail a text, even though I don't like to retake a text, I prepare for the next text we are going to have for the next unit and for all the rest unit we are going to learn. I like to learn ahead of the class because am not really smart to learn in class so instead I learn and prepare ahead in class. Planning and taking notes in class or anywhere else can make you tend to do something than to sit there idle to plan your future. Making plans for the future helps you achieve or accomplish your goal.

On the other hand, many people often argue that staying idle to achieve your goal will make you less stressful. They say that because people want to achieve their goal by doing something, they often take pills that will make them stay awake especially for the high schoolers'. They say this because most high schoolers' wants to achieve more, graduate and get a better college and a great permanent job so they put all their might into studying and drinking and taking pills to stay awake and some student often get sick but can't stop cause they have been addicted to it. Although this may be valid, but doing something always makes you great and achieve your future goals and helps you to be more responsible in the future because in the future it will be easy for you to get a job and mostly half of every job will ask whether you have an experience or you being qualified for the job. And you probably don't know what's going to happen in the future so you to be prepared and planned for the future.

In a nutshell, I like to plan my future goals and learn ahead of my class. Completing an action all the time will forever make you involve in important duties. It also helps you discover more. It can also help you improve in your studies and make you a successful person in the future. It will make you useful in your workplace. Many teachers and other colleagues will admire and respect you and you can even turn out to be their model.

Growing up in a small town, I always dreamed of exploring the great unknown. When I first heard about the Seagoing Cowboys program, I knew it was my chance to find adventure on the open seas. This program allows landlubbers like myself to experience life aboard a tall ship and visit ports around the world. 

Some might say life at sea is too unpredictable, but I say that's what makes it exciting. Through Seagoing Cowboys, I've braved raging storms, swung from rigging high above the deck, and watched magnificent sunrises over glassy oceans. Just when you think you've seen it all, a pod of whales or tropical island comes into view. No two days are ever the same. I've learned much about sailing tall ships while strengthening my mind and body to overcome challenges.

Not only have I grown as a person, but I've also gained insight into other cultures. The article described my voyage to the Caribbean, where I swam alongside sea turtles and haggled with merchants in bustling markets. In Alaska, our crew was welcomed by Native peoples and shown how they sustain life closer to nature. Every new place offers fresh lessons and perspectives to take home. 

While the program demands long hours of hard work, the rewards are immeasurable. I've formed bonds with people from around the world who share my adventurous spirit. The memories and skills I've gained will stay with me forever, long after my seafaring days are done. For anyone seeking thrills, knowledge and lifelong friends, I encourage signing up for Seagoing Cowboys. The unpredictable life aboard a tall ship is one worth experiencing.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,6
864C2D595DF7,"Many students want freedom when it comes to learning. In order to assure students are developing their knowledge over the summer, schools are requiring students to complete a summer project. Many argue whether these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Despite the majority of the school year being teacher-designed, summer projects should be student-designed because teachers will assign an unnecessary amount of work, students can incorporate personal interests, and they can work on what they need to improve.

Over break, some teachers give out a copious amount of work to complete. An example of when teachers assign an excess amount of work is shown when a teacher assigns multiple packets of work to complete over winter break. Students rarely get any free time because of the mass amount of homework. Over the summer students should not have to deal with the stress of completing assignments that fill up the whole break. Another example of teachers giving too much work is shown when kids have to stay in and work on school-work instead of playing with their friends. After a long, challenging year of school students deserve a break to refresh their minds. If the summer projects are student-designed, the length of the assignment will be appropriate. Giving the student the right amount of time to learn as well as have fun. Students need a break from learning, furthermore, if teachers design the project they will not leave students with much time to enjoy summer.

Too make the summer project more enjoyable, a student-designed project will enable the ability to incorporate ones own interests. When someone gets to work with their own interests they tend to become more passionate, for example, when an athlete gets to write about their favorite sports team he will be able to easily complete the assignment on a topic that they already follow. Allowing students to include their interests will allow everyone to relate to the project. As a result more students will finish their projects on time. A student-designed project will give the student freedom with the way they express their knowledge, for instance, the student will decide how his project will be presented whether it be PowerPoint, poster, and many more. This gives the student the ability to choose which format they are more comfortable with. On top of being comfortable, they can show off their skills and creativity with whichever option they choose. To include every individual, a student-designed project will allow people to work with what they enjoy doing.

An advantage of using a student-designed project is that students are able to work on the classes that need improvement. Furthermore, this student-designed project can be used as a way to practice topics that the individual has a conflict with. With a teacher-designed project they have no way of knowing every single students weak spots. If students get to design their own project based on previous history, it will ultimately lead to better grades. Another benefit of being able to work on classes that need improvement is shown in the example of when a student misses a unit of learning due to unfortunate circumstances and is able to make-up the learning in the summer. The summer is the perfect opportunity to work on previously missed assignments. Using a student-designed project gives students the ability to be able to work on what they need to know rather than being forced to work on an assignment that the teacher offers. Students should design their projects because they are able to grow on the subjects that need improvement.

Overall, summer projects should be designed by the student because teachers may give out too much work, students can work with their personal interests, and student can choose a topic that they need more practice in.

Giving students their freedom on how they learn is very important, as everybody obtains information differently. Hopefully students will be able to design their projects and assignments throughout the school year as well.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
985FC4A0FAE2,"Some school are offering distance learning ash an opportunity for a student attend classes from home by way of online or video conference. I think this would be a good idea because is offering a good opportunity for people that can not be able to attend the school during the morning for other occupation personal and give a chance to get the diploma .Also is good opportunity to the people the can not be able to attend classes because they work. Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school that's a lot of benefit for people that don't work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school.

Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason.

Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you that's helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home.

Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. and Also they don't have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work.

Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the don't have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they don't have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online that's going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools .",0,original_moth,Task: Consider the benefits of being able to take online classes instead of attending school in person.

darragh_claude_v7_447,"Studying Venus Despite the Dangers

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, even in the face of significant dangers. While Venus' surface presents extreme challenges for exploration, the potential scientific rewards justify carefully planned missions. 

Venus' harsh environment of dense atmosphere and immense surface temperatures pose serious obstacles. However, the article details how we have already gained valuable insights through robotic missions. Probes have analyzed the atmosphere, mapped surface features, and gathered data on geological activities - all without direct contact with the surface. This evidence shows scientific objectives can still be achieved from orbit and aircraft, reducing risk to human life.

The article also notes Venus may hold clues about Earth's early evolution. Comparisons between the planets could reveal how Venus became inhospitable while Earth developed life-sustaining conditions. Such findings would deepen our understanding of planetary formation and what factors dictate a world'shabitability. Given these kinds of profound questions addressed, the potential rewards of Venus exploration are highly significant.

While extreme heat and pressure on the surface present risks, the author argues a judicious approach can continue yielding new knowledge about our sister planet in a safe manner. Robotic scouts can first map promising regions and test new materials and systems before commiting humans. With care and gradually increasing complexiry of missions, the scientific community can build on past successes at Venus to gain a deeper comprehension of terrestrial planet processes, well worth the challenges involved. In summation, the article convincingly shows studying Venus has merit as a worthy scientific endeavor despite its dangers if pursued prudently through robotic means or future clever engineering solutions.",1,darragh_claude_v7,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

D13D39A7CD7E," Being true to oneself is the greatest privilege that one can have, and it can lead to many accomplishments in life. It is difficult to find one's place in a world that is constantly trying to fit everyone into a mold, but being true to oneself is the key to success.

A positive attitude can help in many ways by providing security and motivation. When we approach the world with a positive mindset, we are more likely to achieve important things in life. It is important to have a clear understanding of what being positive means, and to practice it consistently. By doing so, we can go for a good way and achieve our goals.

The most important thing in life is to have a dream. Dreaming inspires us to achieve great things and to create our own ideas. It is important to have dreams because life is not easy, but neither is it impossible. Dreams are the primary goal that can be reached by ourselves. While some people believe that being true to oneself is not the greatest accomplishment, others argue that it is because it allows us to achieve anything we set our minds to.

However, there are several important things to consider when pursuing our dreams. Firstly, we need to have the determination and discipline to follow through with our plans. We must be willing to make sacrifices and overcome obstacles in order to achieve our goals. Secondly, we must have the courage to take risks and step out of our comfort zones. Without taking risks, we will never know what we are capable of achieving.

Being true to oneself is the greatest accomplishment because it allows us to reach many things in life. It is not good to have a negative attitude in life because it can limit our potential. A self-aware person can inspire something great and make a difference in the world. It is important to be true to oneself because it is our responsibility to achieve our goals and make the most of our lives.

5BAD13A833BC,"A computer reading your emotions? In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smila"" the author talks about how Facial Action Coding System is able to read emotions and how it may help students in the classroom. This technology in a classroom will not be beneficial because it is costly, may distract students, invades privacy, and may lead to ineffective learning.

In paragraph 7 the author states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"". The average home PC's price ranges from about $200 USD to $500 USD. Since the average home computers can not handle these algorithms then the school must purchase higher end computers which will be very costly since every student will need one. Also every student travels throughout the school so the school must be able to purchase laptops with this advanced hardware and software so that the students will be able to use them in every class they attend.

In paragraph 6 of the article the author states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and ""then it could modify the lesson"". When in a lesson at school not every student will enjoy the lesson, which will cause them to have a bored or even tiresome expression. Having this expression will cause the computer to attempt and make the lesson more intresting; but what if the student is still bored? The computer will keep trying to modify the lesson which could cause it to lead away from the original goal of the lesson so much that the student is no longer focused on the original topic.

Having a computer constantly reading your emotions will invade on your privacy. Paragraph 6 states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" ""Then it could modify the lesson"". When detecting the student is bored or confused it will have to relay this information to the teacher letting them know that due to the student's emotion that it will be modifying the lesson to accomodate them. This means that when a student may be having a bad day or may just be in a bad mood that it will recognize that and store that information so that the teacher can know. The student may not have wanted anyone to know but now this program doesn't allow that student his right to privacy.

Since this program will be modifying your lesson due to your emotions it may lead away from what the teacher was originally trying to teach. If the intended goal is to teach the student how the mitochondria works withing a cell but the student has a bored face on the program will try to modify the lesson. When the lesson is modified it will try to catch the attention of the student even if it has to continue modifying th elesson. The lesson can be modified to such an extent that the student does learn the lesson partially but not as exstensively as the teacher had originally intended.

Facial Action Coding Systems is a great asset in scientific field. The program though is not practicial within a setting such as a classroom. The program may lead to expensive purchases for the school, more distractions for the students, privacy invasion, and lessons which do not teach exactly as intended. ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
620DE3FDAA4F,"By the year 2020 , technology has become a standard in any home, therefor kids have been spending more time indoors playing games then outside, socializing with other people in person than by a screen. Yet there are some benefits to technology, communication ain't one of them. Most kids grow up unaware of how to act in frontÂ of older, even younger people in public because of the lack of communication wen they were young. but by supporting them in their younger years to join a after school club, they can learn new skills that can help them once they get older like how to communicate with others, embraceÂ them selfÂ in clubs they are passionate about and make new friends along the way.

After school clubs are meant to be social, to interact with the people around you, and to help you relive stress from the prior school day. By going the an afterchool club, you gain confidence to talk to new people around you, loss that anxiety to talk to new people you never meet before and just become more socially active than before. clubs were made for this and by forcing kids to join them, they become more exited to come to school just because they know that after school ends they can go hang out with their friends at the afterschool club they decided to meet at. so by encouraging student to join clubs they become more social, but thats not all an aferschool club can provide to a student in school

Clubs offer valuable skills that can help students in the future in many ways. like fir an example, by joining a athletic club like soccer, kids can discover new talents they never knew they had until now, opens paths in their future to become something better like a professional soccer player, or a good hobbiesÂ to maintain because of the good exercise they can archive while playing the sport. Yet other clubs have different tasks in teaching students, likeÂ boy scoutÂ cub. boy scoutÂ provide many skills that become useful in the future, like going on a camping trip. learning to tie a knot become a necessity when camping, Yet dont know how to do it, but you it become second nature because of you taking boy scoutÂ in middle school. All clubs have benefits to children, by teaching them something new or by in bracingÂ a natural talent they have. yet there is one thing that is more important than this.

Yes, clubs are meant to be educational and boost your confidence a little, but the real reason to join a club is to have fun!

having fun s great for your physical and emotional self esteemÂ because when you have fun, you forget about all he stress you have accumulated and relax, enjoying the time time you have with friends, remembering all the friends you have me and reliving all that depression you once had because you were alone gone. by having fun in a athletic sport, you exercise having benefits i your emotional self and physical by reducing the chances of childhood obesity. After school clubs are meant to be fun extensions of your life, point in life where all the stress, disappointment and anxiety you have to go away, by spending time with other people in fun ways. Thats the meaning of a afterschool club, to have fun in it.

So,by indulging students to join an after school club, they can receive multiple benefits in there emotional and social life. giving them ways to relive stress than by vaping or taking prohibited drugs like cocaine or anything else. cubs give them opening inwich to relive themselves from stress in school or home. they provide ways to meet new new people that share those interests and a new way for them to learn new thing in life. Thats why i thinks schools should enforce students to join an afterschool club, so they can learn new thing in differentÂ ways.",0,persuade_corpus,,8

Our snap judgement of something or someone can impact us for the long haul, and this is especially true when it comes to forming lasting impressions of people. Whether we realize it or not, our initial impressions have a powerful impact on our relationships with other people. 

For instance, letâs suppose that you are starting at a new school and you have your first encounter with the principal. If that first meeting goes well, chances are you will have a good attitude about this person and feel respected and welcomed. However, if your first meeting with the principal is unpleasant, you are likely to treat them with distrust and antipathy, and it could color the way you view them for a long time. 

Additionally, our first impressions can determine how we look at the world. When we realize that our instinctive knee-jerk reactions and gut feelings about people and situations should be taken seriously, we realize how much of an impact they can have on our lives. To illustrate this point, letâs say that you walk into a party and you are immediately met with a feeling of warmth and acceptance. This can help to shape the way you feel about the world and can impact the way you interact with the people you meet from then on. On the other hand, if the party is less than hospitable, that can lead you to believe in a more hostile view of the world. 

From these examples, it is clear that our first impressions can be incredibly powerful and can have a long lasting impact on our lives. It is essential to pay close attention to these initial reactions and work to make sure that they are as positive as possible. By doing so, we can ensure that our relationships with people, and our outlook on life, remain healthy and upbeat.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Write an essay about how your first impression can affect your life.,6
F985766E9F50,"Should students participate in school activity? Now there many schools start to let students participate in some of the activity during school or after school. Some activity may interest you but some don't. I think students should at leastÂ be participate in one of the activity because participate in the activity help you learn more new thing, met new peoples, and more time to do something you like.

If you join or participate in any activity I think that will help you learn more. It can help you learn something you like or help you with your future career. Sometime your future career depend on what activity you do or what you learn from it. For example, if you join a sport team than maybe that can help you in the future if you want to be a sport player. You can also serve on the student council to help the school ready for the school event or activity that will help you learn new thing when you go around the school to check on what other class doing and you can learn from that also show your leadership.

Secondly, you can also met new friends during the activity. In some of the activity may required team work so you can met new friends. Sometime when you join the activity that you want but you dont have any friends there you can meet new people to be friends with. If you participate in the activity that will help you learn new thing from your new friends too. Meet new teacher who you not familiar with but they can help you at anytime as they can when you need them. You can also practice after school with friends for the activity.

Lastly, that you can enjoy in something you like. Some of the activity may be something you like to do or enjoy doing it. You may already learn how to do that activity but you don't know well about it. When you don't know a lot about that activity you can participate in it or join it that will help you know more about it and what to do. Maybe you can't have many free time because you participate in the activity but that can help you in the future skills too and that also what you want to do for a long time.

In conclusion I think you should participate in the school activity. The school activity may help you know new skills, met new people you never know, and enjoy your time at the activity. Sometime it not only think you learn in school can help you but the activity also can help you learn. It not important in what you can do but the important thing was in what you can learn and show what you learn.Â Participate in activity can help in you in many different way.

D95DB718C0A4,"Dear Principal,

I am glad that you want students to have good grades to be able to play in sports and other school activities.

I do not agree that us students should have a B average to participate.

Some students can only get as far as a C average.

The lowest average us students should have is a C average.

It would be unfair to only let B average students participate in recreational activities because not everyone is great at school but they do look forward to being active and healthy.

We should be able to take part in these activities because a C average is passing grade average.

We should be allowed to play sports or join clubs as long as we have a passing average.

I disagree with this policy that we must have at least a B average.

C average is a passing average.

We should be able to have as low as a C average.

More people would be able to participate if it was a C average instead of a B average. Thank you for your time.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
8CAF1B7BD82D,"As technology advances in a very constant and remarkable fasion, many new innovations begin to reveal themselves. While we still might be waiting for the next flying car or teleporter, several smaller, yet very significant, inventions have presented themselves. An example of this is a computer software that is able to identify and recognize emotions. Profesor Thomas Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the Univeristy of Illinois created this software in hopes of changing the world for the better, but is it really that great? Among the several other practical uses, Huang says that the use of this technology in the classroom can be the most important. Overall the use of emotional recognition has the potential to be useful due to the ability to change the lesson based on mood, and alter mood based on the current your current status, but overall would not be 100% effective due to the spiratic qualities of humans.

Dr. Huang, the inventor of the emotional recognition, claims there could be huge advancements in the education system due to his new technology. In a time of computer screens, video games, and the newest iphone students have trouble beign lectured for six hours a day. Dr. Huang's main goal is to put a computer with the lesson plans and his software in front of a computer so that it can do the teaching, effectivly. If a student begins to get bored and their zygomatic major muscles begin to relax and visibly show the boredom setting in, Dr Huang's computer software would be able to recognize and alter the lesson to be more engaging to the student. This would easily work for many other situations, if a student is sad the lesson could use brighter colors and better diction to create an enviorment where the student is not distracted and wants to learn. Nick D'Alto describes a situation where a student becomes very confused and does not know what they are doing and how to do it, but with the use of Dr Huang's technology the lesson could be changed and break down to easier steps to correctly compensate for the confusion.

Overall, the use of Dr. Huang's software to change a lesson would be very useful in improving the learning enviorment for the students who will go on to create equally as innovative new mechanism in the future.

Secondly, the software can be used to help change the mood of a student in order to boost morale as well as create an enviorment where the student wants to learn. In this day and age there are so many things for a student to be passionate about, such as: sports, video games, friends, and so much more. This is very good in the sense of passion but ultimately takes away from the desire to learn and become successful in school. Often times a student comes into school with the worst mood possible, hating every second of it, but Dr. Huang could change things up. For example if a student comes into school angry Dr. Huang's facial coding system would be able to create an enviorment where the lesson becomes more like a game for the student to play and enjoy while at the same time learning the content.

If a student comes into school depressed, it could be the job of the system to recognize this, notify someone, and help them be happy.

Dr. Huang's invention creates a short cut in seeing how someone feels through science. At times people are too afraid to ask ,""Are you okay?"". The use of this software can go straight to the aiding of someone without even having to think twice. In the end, emotions create roadblocks for students to learn and the use of Dr. Huang's technolgy can identify and help break them down so that a kid can be a normanl kid again.

Although Dr. Huang's software is extremly useful, things can often be a little more complicate than what technology can actually be good for. While the identifying of emotions is very useful, the actual action of neutralizing them can be beyond the machine. For example, if a student is crying their eyes out with no sign of stopping, I am pretty sure a change in the lesson will not help calm that student. If a student is so mad that they just want to break the computer and storm off, no change in the lessons music, colors, or diction is going to be able to fix that. In general an actual human is what each student needs to be there for them. The warmth of a hug or simple hand on the shoulder can change the outlook on a students entire emotional status. The fact that an actual teacher cares is more than enough to allow the teacher to keep teaching. Overall Dr. Huangs software is incredibly useful to identify emotional change but really can not help deal with most situations like a teacher would.

In conclusion Dr. Huang's software holds its value in it's ability to read emotions and alter the lesson as well as alter the mood of a student in need, but is very limited in how it can help a student get through their troubles. The use of Dr. Huang's technolgy in the classroom will definately lead to advances in student comprehension but for the many individuals that need more than a computer for sypathy, the program most likely will not work.

E2F71EA3C3FE,"Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement that âunless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never growâ is a profound reminder of the importance of seeking new challenges and pushing oneself to continually grow as a person. I have personally experienced the effects of this advice throughout my academic and professional career. On several occasions, I have boldly taken on projects that have initially seemed beyond my current abilities, and each time I have found that, with a bit of hard work and dedication, I can achieve not only success in the task at hand, but also gain even more meaningful insights in the process.

Unfortunately, not everyone has access to or takes the opportunities provided to them to explore and grow, particularly those in less-fortunate socioeconomic situations. Given the daunting lack of resources available to many individuals, the idea of pushing beyond one's current boundaries can seem an insurmountable feat. It is therefore essential that we examine the conditions of the disadvantaged and create equitable solutions to provide them with the same opportunities to reach their full potential. Ways in which this can be done include increasing access to education and job training, as well as offering social and technical support to low-income individuals and families.

83D933BD5B81,"Dear Mr Principal,

I am writing you this letter regarding your decision on making it mandatory for students to perform community service. I myself think that it is sort of a waste of time, depends on what you are going to be doing. If it is something fun then I'll agree on making it mandatory if i have the time, if not then it is a waste of time.

Maybe other students don't think it is but i do because i have many things to do when I get home from school or when i am on break.

If u were to make it mandatory then maybe students might agree if you were too make then do a couple of hours. I don't think that would really bother then that much, but lets say you were to over exaggerate and make then do tons of community service than i would know there reason to be furious. Well bottom of the line is that students should be required to do community service, but to cut them some slack u should mandate them to a whole lot of community service so they wont end up furious. Anyways i hope this letter will aid you with the decision on what you should do. Farwell!

D81FB980878F,"After reading this controversial essay on Electoral College and how it affects other and our ""American People"" I feel personally a bit ashamed at our own country that we allow all this nonsense to have happened. In my opinion I would want too ban the choice of Electoral College, because first off we're looking way too deep into our system of voting, is it really necessary too compare our states number of votes with another's just to possibly get noticed? Why dont we take things into our own hands and not count on voting for some stranger to do the work for us.

In one of they many paragraphs I had read, it simply stated ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that out to be (overruled)"" that doesnt sound like everyone here in America is fully williing too agree to all of this, and I wouldn't blame them.Â  I don't understand why we cant just vote directly for the president ourselves! I mean after all, he is going too be our leader. I just would never put that type of a big decision in somebody else's hands who I don't even know at all, and especially if I know its not completely certain that whomever I had put my vote in for is at a 50/50 chance of winnning as it is.

If there is already an apparent list of five reasons all about retaining the Electoral College because of its democratic pedigree, just is another reason as too why I'm against this kind of voting system. With having the first reason listed as being ""Certainty of Outcome"" should really make the person reading that question themselves on if they're making a right decision or not. You would have too go through a lot of trouble and paperwork as it is whenever voting for someone, At least I would like too know that I'm not basically giving my one vote away for technically someone else to do it for me.

CB2D608AA358,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author starts off by saying the percentage of the different effects Mona Lisa has in her smile. He states that she's 83 percent happy , 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The use of the new technology called "" The facial action Coding System'' in my opinion does not tell you how your honestly feelings. There is no way the computer can see the way you are feeling , just by smiling at the screen does not mean that you are happy. People smile at the screen all the time and has different feelings. Weather the computer can determain how you feel the only person how actually knows how you feel is you and yourself only. A computer can not recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel. There is no way the computer will let you know how you feel , the article is basically saying that just be smiling or looking at the computer it can determine how you are feeling. Once getting to paragraph 3 it starts saying how the facial Action Coding System works they start off by telling us how the process begings, "" the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face: all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" From that sentance in the article it is basacilly saying how the computer has a 3-D sensor on it, and when placing your head infront of it it will scan your muscles and from there determine the way you are feeling. As humans we perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. It is hard for a person to determine how ypu are feeling with just facial expressions , for example I could have a smile on my face but inside I could be feeling sad or mad and only I would know no one else. So the 3-D sensor they have on the computer to determine the way you are feeling is not true , a computer can never determine the way you are feeling it can never say that you are 5 percent happy and 90 percent sad , it does not work like that. Only you and you only know the way you are feeling and thats it. So no a computer can not determine the way you are feeling it can not determine the percent of nothing only you know how you feel and nothing else knows how you feel. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

79f714f8,"Personal automobiles and cars have played a major role throughout the world since the invention of the car in World War 2. Cars have been a very successful invention and many people drive their own every day on their way to work, school or other places their feet cannot carry them. Though the car has fulfilled its duties in making the lives of humans easier, it has also contributed to many negative events. For example, car emissions get trapped in the atmosphere and cause living things to breathe in dirty air around them. Therefore, a revolutionary idea has been spreading around the world: using personal automobiles less. The new aspect of using cars less has promoted a happier society, a cleaner environment, and an open attitude towards alternative transportation.

First of all, by establishing an agreement to decrease car use, people have been said to be happier and stressfree. The continuing congestion and traffic jams that are among most areas of the world, create an enormous amount of stress for the people driving. Many develop road rage or irritability and are unhappy after suffering from a long ride home because of traffic. Some believe that cities should become more like Vauban, a community in Germany in which the citizens have given up their cars, because those who live there are not focused on driving and are pleased living in such a manner. Heidrun Walter, a mother who lives in Vauban, portrays her love for this carfree community when she states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Rosenthal. By living in an area with little or no use of cars, the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress to cope with. In addition, with no cars people are forced to spend more of their time outside to get from one place to another. In Bogota, Colombia there is an annual carfree day, in which anyone who does use their car has to pay a fine. Many spend their day outside walking or riding their bikes to get around and believe that the carfree day is ""a good opportunity to take away stress..."" Selsky. As they exercise more without cars and enjoy the great outdoors, they wear bright smiles on their faces and look at things with a positive attitude.

With a smaller amount of people using their personal vehicles, less gas emissions are becoming a part of the Earth's atmosphere. Humans breathe in the gases that are polluting the air and can become sick from it. The environment suffers from the dirty air and may not be able to sustain life if there is not a stop to the large amounts of pollutants being emitted into the air. In the United States, passenger cars are the cause of ""up to 50 percent"" of greenhouse gas emissions while in Europe they are ""responsible for 12 percent"" Rosenthal. This means that the car use in the United States is ruining the air around us and assists greatly in creating a disgusting environment. In popular and global cities, pollution is even more noticeable and overwhelming. For example, in Paris smog has become an everlasting issue. The climate in the area contributes to the smog filling the air along with the use of cars: ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Chicago Tribune. To reduce the smog in the area, an elaborate plan was taken into action. Cars with even license plates could not drive on certain days and cars with odd license plates could not drive on the other days. By doing this, the air in Paris cleared up dramtically. Therefore by promoting a system where car usage is not as common, the environment can become healthier and cleaner, which benefits the citizens of the Earth.

Last, declining the use of cars creates an open attitude towards alternative transportation methods. Those who live in carfree communities discover new ways to reach the destinations they have reach throughout the day. Some will utilize their body and take advantage of nature by biking or walking from one place or another. Others might us public transportation or will carpool with those who do own a car. As previously mentioned before, Colombia participates in a car free day, which means ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses"" to get where they needed to be Selsky. Their use of other means of transportation on the day without cars, exemplifies that it is possible to live using other ways to get around. Some people are against the idea of using other transportation, but if they were to see the impact the alternatives have, they would be more accepting. These days many young people tend to get their license later by waiting until they reach their twenties, suggesting that they can live a happy life without relying on a personal automobile. Instead of using their own cars, they find other ways to get to work or school. These people become acclimated to organizing their lives ""around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends"" Rosenthal. Younger people who commit their lives to walking or public transportation, become aware of the fact that driving a machine that can negatively affect the world is not a necessity. Their awareness then can continue passing on to each generation and can ultimately prevent the excessive use of cars throughout the world.

In conclusion, a life without cars might be a life worth living since it contributes to a stressfree society, a healthy environment, and an acceptance of other means of transportation. By relying less on cars, people can eliminate the variety of negative impacts on the world. The Earth can become a happier, cleaner, and more accepting place with a dead engine.",0,train_essays,,5
95271de1cbd7_04112023,"Riding the Waves: Why You Should Join the Seagoing Cowboys Program

Growing up on a ranch in Florida, I always loved the ocean but never thought I'd get to experience it the way I have through the Seagoing Cowboys program. When I first saw their sign-up at the county fair, I was skeptical but decided it was worth a try. I'm so glad I did - it has opened my eyes to incredible adventures and places I never imagined. If you're someone who wants excitement and new experiences, the Seagoing Cowboys is the opportunity for you.

This program has allowed me to learn skills I never would have on the ranch. During our two-week stints aboard boats transporting livestock, I've gained firsthand knowledge about seamanship, navigation, and caring for animals at sea. Even though I've been raising cattle my whole life, handling them on choppy waters was a real challenge that taught me new levels of problem-solving and responsibility. The cattle handlers and captains I've worked with have decades ofexperience that they've passed on to me. Skills I never thought relevant to ranching have proven hugely valuable. 

Not only have I gained professional skills, but I've also been lucky enough to visit amazing parts of the country I may never have seen otherwise. Whether it was traversing the Intracoastal Waterway along the Florida coastline or sailing beyond the Florida Keys into the Caribbean, each journey has felt like an adventure. I've spotted wildlife like leaping dolphins and flying fish right from the decks. In different ports, I've explored new cities, tried local foods, and immersed myself in cultures unlike my small rural town back home. Life on the open ocean day after day is thrilling - you never know what surprises may be just over the horizon.

If you love challenging yourself, learning through hands-on experience, and seeing new places, I know you would thrive in the Seagoing Cowboys program just as I have. The application process is simple, and you don't need any prior boating or ranching skills. You just need enthusiasm and a desire to spread your wings beyond what you thought possible. Don't miss this chance to ride the waves to adventures you'll remember for a lifetime. Sign up today - I promise it's an opportunity you won't regret.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,0
llama_70b_v1968,"Teachers are the backbone of our education system, and their evaluation is a crucial aspect of ensuring that they are performing their duties effectively. While some individuals argue that students should have the right to grade their teachers, I firmly believe that this approach is not the best way to evaluate a teacher's performance. In this essay, I will argue against student evaluations of teachers and provide specific reasons to support my stance.

First and foremost, allowing students to evaluate their teachers could lead to biased and unreliable assessments. Students may grade their teachers based on personal preferences, rather than on their actual teaching abilities. For instance, a teacher may be penalized for giving strict assignments or for not allowing students to use their phones during class, even though these policies are in place to ensure the students' academic success. Moreover, students may not have the maturity or knowledge to evaluate their teachers' teaching methods or pedagogical skills. They might focus on trivial matters, such as the teacher's appearance or personality, rather than their ability to convey complex concepts.

Another reason why student evaluations are not an effective way to assess teachers' performance is that they could create a hostile work environment. If students are given the power to evaluate their teachers, they may feel emboldened to be disrespectful or uncooperative in class. This could lead to a lack of discipline and a decrease in the overall quality of education. Furthermore, teachers may feel stressed or intimidated by the constant scrutiny, which could affect their ability to perform their duties effectively.

Furthermore, student evaluations could undermine the authority of teachers and create a power imbalance in the classroom. Teachers are responsible for maintaining order and discipline, and their authority is essential for creating a productive learning environment. If students are allowed to evaluate their teachers, they may feel that they have the upper hand, which could lead to a breakdown in the teacher-student relationship. This could result in a lack of respect for the teacher and a decrease in the students' motivation to learn.

In contrast, I believe that teachers should be evaluated by their peers or by administrators who have the knowledge and expertise to assess their performance. These evaluations should be based on objective criteria, such as lesson plans, teaching methods, and student progress. This approach would ensure that teachers are held accountable for their performance, while also providing them with the support and resources they need to improve.

In conclusion, while the idea of student evaluations of teachers may seem appealing, it is not an effective way to assess a teacher's performance. It could lead to biased and unreliable assessments, create a hostile work environment, undermine the authority of teachers, and compromise the quality of education. Instead, teachers should be evaluated by their peers or by administrators who have the knowledge and expertise to assess their performance objectively. This approach would ensure that teachers are held accountable for their performance, while also providing them with the support and resources they need to improve.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Some people believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers.

D54C778A8F9C," I believe that individuals have the freedom to make their own decisions or seek guidance from experts or authorities. However, ultimately, it is their responsibility to choose what they want to do in life. While it can be helpful to have an expert or authority to provide guidance, it is not necessary for those who are responsible and have a clear plan in mind.

Those who value self-reliance and take pride in doing things on their own, such as completing homework, classwork, and jobs, may feel that seeking guidance from experts is unnecessary. However, when it comes to important life decisions, it can be beneficial to seek guidance from experts who have experience and knowledge in the subject matter.

While it can be challenging to make decisions on your own, it can also be rewarding. It allows individuals to take control of their lives and make decisions that align with their values and goals. However, it can also be exhausting and overwhelming, especially when facing complex or difficult decisions.

In conclusion, while it is ultimately up to individuals to make their own decisions, seeking guidance from experts can be helpful in certain situations.

827472D8F8A9,"There are always peple saying that aliens are alive and maybe that there is going to be an alien invasion. In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) found an image of a peron or as MGS says a ""a Viking photo."" I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it's a landform.

I believe the image is a just a landform because scientists haven't discovered life yet on mars even though they have found water on Mars. In paragraph 2, the author states, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" I agree with this statement because if the Martian mesa was made again, that means that they will be around for a long time and it will never disappear. The author also states that people think the image or the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. By the looks of the images, I could see that every year they have taken it, I can see that it's disappearing. In the introduction, it says, ""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is is: A mesa."" If people want evidence of aliens or other creatures, they will have to do research on their spare time because scientists have a job to do and they will only do what they are ordered to do. Just to be clear, when they took the photos of the Face on 1976,1998, and 2001, the technology wasn't as advanced as it is today but, if we take a photo of it today, I believe there will probably be another one of the landfoms or probably we might see the Face but just slowly disappearing. These were some of my reasons to argue with to support my belief of the Face being a natural landform.

In conclusion, the image of the Face was just a myth and I will never say it was created by aliens. Aliens aren't even real, that hasn't benn confirmed or said. Not one scientist has said that they have seen a living creature on any planet walking or doing anything. These were just rumors and it can be said as a myth if people want. Based on these reasons, I believe the Face is just a natural landform on Mars.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
D4334DC15691,"Personsonaly, I think that being able to read students emotion would help in the classroon more for the teacher than the other students. It may show when the student is unhappy, tred, mad, or sad. Believe it or not i think this is huge especially in a classroom.

In the exerpt it says that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Two minuets ago i would have never guessed that, but it's a good thing to know that. If it were to be a student, to knwo that he/she is maybe angry is very helpful in that it shows that we cant push them or tell them to do something the same way we normally would. We need to descelate the situation and make this person more on the happy side before we do anything else.

Yes it is a little odd to think that a humans facial structure can be generated on on a comuter, but at the same time it was only amatter of time before this would happen. in fact, this happens all the time for movies and video games. The face has 44 muscles and the computers generatin of the face must have the same exact 44 muscles in it in order to read and produce a human like analyzation of a face.

Weather what we have right now is that acurate, i'm not sure, but what i do know is that it is impresive.

People like Dr. Huang relie on the work of a psychologist like Dr. Paul Eckman who is the creator of FACS which stands for Facial Action Coding System. The exerpt says that Eckman has descovered the following emotions due to the muscle movements. Happy, sad, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness. The example given in the text is the frontal pars lateralis muscle or above your eyes rise when you are suprised.

Overall i do believe that this would be helpfull to read a students emotion to show how to aproach him or her and to show what to say and how to say it. Everything is dependent on how you say things nowadays. If you say one thing wrong that person may go off on you or may take it really well you just never know, but if that person is angry then you may want to aproach that person with care instead of just going at them full speed.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
llama_70b_v11051,"Climate change is a really big issue that affects us all. It's like, the Earth is getting sick and we need to do something to make it better. Some people think that governments should do something right away to help, but others don't think it's that big of a deal. I think that governments should totally take action to stop climate change.

First of all, climate change is causing a lot of problems already. Like, the polar bears are losing their homes and stuff. It's so sad! And if we don't do something, it's only gonna get worse. The weather is getting all weird and stormy, and it's affecting people's homes and livelihoods. It's not fair to just sit back and do nothing while the Earth gets sicker and sicker.

Secondly, if we don't do something about climate change, it's gonna be really hard to fix later on. It's like, if you have a cold, you can take some medicine and feel better in a few days. But if you wait too long, you might need to go to the hospital and it'll be way more difficult to get better. Climate change is the same way. If we don't do something now, it'll be way harder to fix later on.

Lastly, taking action against climate change will actually help our economy and society in the long run. Like, if we invest in green energy and technology, it'll create new jobs and help our economy grow. And if we make our cities and towns more environmentally friendly, it'll be better for our health and well-being. It's a win-win situation!

Of course, some people might argue that taking action against climate change will be too expensive or that it won't make a difference. But I think that's not true. Like, yes, it might cost some money to invest in green energy and technology, but it'll be worth it in the long run. And every little bit helps, so even if we can't solve the whole problem right away, it's still important to do our part.

In conclusion, climate change is a big problem that we need to address right away. It's not something that we can just ignore or put off for later. Governments should take immediate action to address climate change because it's the right thing to do for our planet, our economy, and our society. We need to take action now, so that we can have a better future for ourselves and for future generations.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The issue of climate change has become increasingly important in recent years.

92B418CEA06E," My mother's uncle, Generic_Name, had a dream of becoming a lawyer. He worked hard to achieve this goal, taking all the necessary steps to attend college and pay for his classes. Generic_Name woke up early every morning to attend college and later took a bus to work. After years of hard work, he became a lawyer. However, he soon realized that the real challenge lay ahead. Despite his success, Generic_Name never imagined that he would face obstacles that would test his resilience and determination.

After two years of graduation, Generic_Name found a job, bought a house, and a car. He was content with his life, but he soon realized that he had reached a plateau. He no longer had any aspirations or goals to strive for. In my opinion, this is a mistake. We should never stop striving to be better than we were yesterday. If we don't try to do something beyond what we have already mastered, we will never grow and have the experience to lead a better quality of life.

We need to keep pushing ourselves to learn and grow. Every experience we have, no matter how small, can help us to gain knowledge and a better understanding of the world around us. If we never take on new challenges, we will never have the opportunity to learn and grow. For example, if we go to college and complete our degree, but we stop there, we will never have the chance to apply what we have learned and make a real difference in the world.

Furthermore, if we continue to learn and grow, we will have a better quality of life. We will have the skills and knowledge to succeed in our careers, and we will be able to help others. For example, if we continue to learn and improve our skills, we will be one step closer to our goals and be able to make a positive impact on the world.

In conclusion, I believe that we should never stop striving to be better than we were yesterday. We should always have aspirations and goals to work towards, and we should never stop learning and growing. This will not only help us to achieve success in our personal and professional lives, but it will also help us to lead a better quality of life.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

E5201ED86F74,"I have been serving as a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" for a great amount of time and I think you should think of being one was well. There are many reasons to be one, you get to help countries recover animals and supplies, you get to see different countries and their most interesting places, and you get to have fun on the trips too.

One of my first reasons is that you get to help countries recover animals and supplies and help their people. It was an extremely great honor to help the countries that were affected by World War II. It also opened up the world to me, it made me more aware of other countries and their needs. If you join then you would feel like a better person because you would know that you helped multiple countries recover from a giant war that affected many people.

Including helping countries, you get to sightsee and explore them as well. From what I saw, every country has many beautiful and wonderful places to explore and see. I've seen many places in different countries such as, a castle in Crete, the Panama Canal on my way to China, and I've even taken a gondola ride in Venice, Itay. I got to see these many places just by signing up in this program. That is another reason why you should participate in being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Finally, on the return trips after the animals have been unloaded, there are games that we play in the empty holds where the animals have been housed. So if you think that this job would be tireing and no fun you're wrong. We played many fun and competitive games on board such as baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. Even with an exhausting job you still have a great opportunity to have fun while still helping many countires.

In conclusion, I, Luke Bomberger, extremely recommend being a Seagoing Cowboy. Not only do you get to do great things to help, you get to have fun and see the world. Those are a few of the many reasons why you should join this program. Being a Seagoing Cowboy changed my life greatly and it opened up the world to me, I have no regrets signing up for it, I'm sure you won't regret it too.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

I think it is a brilliant idea for us the students, to take on a opportunity to help out by doing community service. I think it is brilliant because it would be like a win-win situation where it benefits both the community and us. If everybody gets a chance to help out the community I think we should take it! It would be great doing something to give back to our community seeing that not many people are interested in helping out. Not only will the environment become a safer place to live in but, it will also become a healthier place. What would happen if after a while no one took care of our community? For an example It's like taking care of your room, what if one day you decided not to put things in there proper places and just threw things anywhere and left it untidy? It might begin to smell, or you might even discover things missing. So taking care of our community is like taking care of own self. Doing this could be a really good deed, giving back to the community to make it a healthier place. For example, maybe we can go 2-3 times a week picking up trash, even just starting with our own football field.

B8588FFF0828,"Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are considering to let students have cell phones in our school.

I have written this letter to try and convince you not to.

If students are able to text, chat, call, and play with their phones and with other people, no one would learn anything anymore.

Nearly all the students would be immersed in their cell phones, and with the cell phones available, people could search the web, go online, play games, listen to music, practically everything, right there on their cell phone.

I assure you that if you let people have their cell phones, average grades would be lower than if they didn't, as not everyone one would be paying attention to the teacher's lecture, power-point, video, etc., but instead they would be secretly texting each other and searching the web or playing games.

It is very easy to hide a cell phone while using it.

It could be in a book, or under a desk.

And yet, these are not the only issues.

Some of the students here don't have as much financially as other students.

The cell phones will arouse jealousy and lead to stealing.

If you have this rule in place, you can potentially be accounted responsible for lost or stolen phones.

If you are seriously considering this, don't let students have their cell phones at all.

They would not need to pay attention in class or learn anything, instead, they would just need some WiFi to look it up on their phone.

Don't allow students to have their cell phoned on and in use every day.

If you truly care about your students education at this school, you will listen to this, and ban all cell phone use.

So what shall it be. Do you care about your students, or not?

Sincerely,

One of your students",0,persuade_corpus,,2

One, because you might just have one bad test that might bring your average down. I know that there might be a test that you flunk and that brings down your average. If you have a bad average then you might be eligible to play for the championship game. That is why the C average would help the students if just one grade was bringing there whole average down.

Two, because if you have a bad grade point average then and you are on academic probation, you still need to be active. this is another reason you should keep the grade point average a C. Staying active will keep you is good for your health and good for your learning. it is good for your learning because exercise stimulates the brain keeping you more attentive and awake in class.

Okay, so, let's start with the positive effects of technology.  I mean, technology has made our lives so much easier, you know? Like, we can communicate with people all over the world with just a few taps on our phones. It's like, mind-blowing! And with all the online learning resources, we can learn new things and expand our knowledge without even leaving our homes. That's pretty cool, right? 

But,  there are also some negative effects of technology.  Like, for one thing, we're all becoming super addicted to our devices.

While venus is simple to see from the distant away but still safe . Earth, Venus, and mars are the planetary neighbor, that will go aroud the other planets. Venus is very close to the sun . Venus is just like a evening star that they call it in different places.

Each previous mission was unmanned, and for more than a few hours. They always tried to watch venus the planet to see if there was anything new or they need to know something about it . Venus is kinda hot just like the sun becuase they are both close together. Even the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. The conditions can get far more extreme then humans which can get very bad.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. Venus will be able to allow scienctists to see more thing and allow them to float above the fray. Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only provide a little amount of stuff that will go on.

8D3F64CB71A3,"Car usage is very popular in this world we have come to know. It used for many means of transportation like going to work, school, social events, or just simply going shopping or hanging out with friends. Those are some up sides to havingÂ  and using a car. But they are some down sides as well. I will be explaining the down sides of using a car as well as the advantages of limiting car usage.

My first reason in this topic that i have chosen to tell you about are ""Car-free"" cities. what are Car-free cities? well the name says it all is a new project they are working on in europe of this city who is car free. This new city has no cars, no street parking, no driveways or or home garages. Why do they exist? well the obvious answer is to minimize car pollution that are creating green house gases and are polluting the air and more places can adopt this idea and have more ""car-free"" cities so we can save the planet and ultimately save our selves from extinction because we did not know how to maintain our planet clean. Also a thing a like about this new ""Car-free"" city is thatÂ  theres a main street where theres all the stores at a walking distance like how great is that? u can just take a ten to twenty minute walk and go shopping for anything like grocerys, shoes, clothe, restaurants instead of driving to a mall along some distant highway and ultimately that is where everybody is so hanging out with your friends and meeting all up in one place is at a walking distance and if you dont have any friends well you make new friends at this main street because that is where everybody is.

Another great reason for considering less car usage is less traffic. Who does not like less traffic? everybody hates traffic is slow, boring, and annoying. Now if we have less traffic that means we have less commute time when trying to get to work if you have a job that is far from your home and that means you get to work sooner and on time and hopefully get a raise because you feel like you dont get paid anough to do what you do. Also if we have less traffic we have less commute time and what does that mean? well it can mean multiple things like having more time to sleep because you dont have to worry about waking up early to beat the morning traffic like my mom and plenty of other people do. At the end of the day you will be able to get home quicker so you can spend more time with your family and do stuff you usually cant because of the time you spend at traffic.

My last reason is a very important reason and it is simply ""safety"". Think about it, it is simply just common sense. if they are less cars in the road at one time then the chances of car accidents decreases. Now i dont know about you but that sounds like a win win to me. One theres less accidents so theres less people in the hospital so they dont have hospital bills to worry about and less accidents means less traffic as well. And also if you ban the cars for a day or have one of them ""car-free"" cities you have less drunk drivers; one because they dont have a car so they will probably just drink at home and two if the bar or where ever is that there going to drink is close enough then they can just ""walk"" there sober and ""walk"" back to the house drunk instead of being in a car a causing a fatal accident.

Ultimately i feel that the usage of cars should be limmited because of many reasons. This reasons are as follows. Less car pollution. living in a car-free city so you are able to walk everywhere. Less traffic, less commute time, having more time to do stuff. and last but not least the safety of drivers. personally i think we should supervise the usage of automobiles and have more ""car-free"" cities and have days where car usage is baned or restricted by some amount.

falcon_180b_v1_300,"I think that video games can contribute to violent behavior in some people. The reason why I think so is because some video games are very violent and can make people feel aggressive. For example, when I play games like Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty, I feel like I am actually in the game and shooting people. This can make me feel angry and aggressive towards others.

Moreover, some studies have shown that playing violent video games can increase aggression and decrease empathy. A study by Anderson and Bushman found that playing violent video games led to an increase in aggressive thoughts and behavior. Another study by Gentile and Anderson found that playing violent video games led to a decrease in empathy towards others.

However, I also understand that not everyone who plays violent video games becomes violent in real life. There are many other factors that contribute to violent behavior, such as family upbringing, mental health issues, and social environment. Therefore, I do not think that video games are the sole cause of violent behavior.

In conclusion, while I believe that video games can contribute to violent behavior in some people, I also think that it is important to consider other factors that may be involved. It is not fair to blame video games alone for violent behavior.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"There is an ongoing debate about the impact of video games on behavior.

DE54A8F9C29C,"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that classes in the arts should be mandatory in school. While some may argue that elective courses in the arts are better suited for students who have a genuine interest in the subject, I believe that mandatory classes in the arts can provide numerous benefits to students, including increased student engagement, lower dropping rates, and better career preparation.

Firstly, mandatory classes in the arts can greatly increase student engagement in school. Many students, myself included, find that the arts provide a much-needed break from the rigor of academic subjects. Whether it's through music, dance, theater, or visual arts, engaging in creative pursuits can help students relax and recharge, which can ultimately lead to increased motivation and focus in other subjects. Additionally, the arts can provide a sense of community and belonging, as students work together to create something meaningful.

Secondly, mandatory classes in the arts can help to lower dropping rates. According to a study by the National Endowment for the Arts, students who participate in the arts are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college. This is likely due to the fact that the arts provide a sense of accomplishment and pride, as well as a sense of purpose and direction. Furthermore, the arts can help students develop important skills such as discipline, time management, and problem-solving, which can be applied to other areas of their lives.

Finally, mandatory classes in the arts can better prepare students for the workforce. Many jobs, particularly in the creative industries, require employees to have a strong background in the arts. By providing students with a solid foundation in the arts, we can help to ensure that they are better equipped to succeed in the future. Additionally, the arts can help students develop important soft skills such as communication, collaboration, and critical thinking, which are highly valued by employers.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that classes in the arts should be mandatory in school. While some may argue that elective courses are better suited for students with a genuine interest in the subject, I believe that mandatory classes in the arts can provide numerous benefits to students, including increased student engagement, lower dropping rates, and better career preparation. By providing all students with access to the arts, we can help to ensure that they are better equipped to succeed in the future.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,2
875B5DAF0C7A,"What would you do if you saw a face on Mars? Twenty five years ago we found a landform that looks like a face on mars surface. It is a big ovle that looks like it has eyes a face and nose. The face is looking right out into outer space and it has a veiw of the whole solar system. When the NASA spacecraft called Viking 1 taking pictures of spots were its sister ship could land Viking 2 it was if the face was looking at them. There is not a face on mars, it is just a landform with a shadow that makes it look like a face.

There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. In paragraph three is says that A few days after discovering the face they set it out for all to see, and the caption noted ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, and took pictures with there Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) they revealed that there were no aliens and that it was just a landform.

In paragraph eight it says that not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at forty-one degrees norht martian latitude where it was winter in april '98 a cloudy time of year on the planet. So skeptis said that perhaps the the alien markings were hidden by the haze. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids you could tell what they are.

What the picture actually shows is the Matian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around American West. This pictures shows a face but it is just a landform with a shadow making it look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose. People think that aliens are making signs saying that this land is theres but its just a landform nothing more, nothing less. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydoria Mars Global Surveyor (MOC) drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolutuin. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

The Face on Mars has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for twenty five years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancietn civilazation on Mars. But there is no such thing as aliens, nothing can live on mars or any other planets besides earth. Some scientists think that the Face was an alien artifact, photographing \Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the red planed in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.

BC0703638937,"Listening to multiple pieces of advice from different people is like having a puzzle with many pieces. Each piece represents a different perspective, and when you put them all together, you get a complete picture of what's important. It's like having a map with multiple routes to reach your destination, and you can choose the best one based on your current situation.

Personally, I have found that listening to multiple pieces of advice has helped me in many ways. For instance, when I was trying to decide which high school extracurricular activity to join, my parents told me to do something that I was interested in, while my friends told me to do something that they were interested in. At first, I thought they were giving me conflicting advice, but then I realized that they were coming from different perspectives. My parents were worried about my future college applications, while my friends were worried about having fun. By considering both of their opinions, I was able to make a decision that was best for me.

Another time, I was struggling with a difficult assignment in math class. My teacher told me to use a certain method to solve the problem, but my tutor told me to use a different method. At first, I was confused and frustrated, but then I realized that they were both right. My teacher was focusing on the most efficient way to solve the problem, while my tutor was focusing on the way that would help me understand the concept better. By listening to both of them, I was able to find a solution that worked for me.

However, there are also negative aspects of listening to multiple pieces of advice. Sometimes, people can give conflicting advice, and it can be hard to know what to do. For example, when I was trying to decide whether to join a sports team or a book club, my parents told me to do one thing, while my friends told me to do the other. It was confusing and frustrating, and I didn't know what to do. In situations like these, it's important to trust your instincts and make a decision that feels right for you.

In today's school systems are the large usage of technology, which can be seen with the development of educational apps and school issued laptops. This is beneficial to students as it provides access to their assignments inside, and outside of class to be completed on time. However, school can be an overwhelming distraction to many students, which enable them to procrastinate their school work. Which could be solved with the option of distance learning, as it would provide students a learning environment they can focus in. Distance learning could also prepare students mentally for online courses during highschool, and their future educational paths in college. Especially if students communicate with their teachers for designated video conferencing, or check-in's to see progression.

The option of distance learning can also be beneficial to those struggling with mental illnesses. School environments can be overwhelming, and home may be a learning environement they're comfortable in. Besides this, students with mental health issues may have therapy appointments that cause them to fall behind in their classes- but with the usage of distance learning they could avoid it, and be able to schedule appointments with their teachers to stay on task. Distance learning has a wide spread benefit to those struggling, especially in today's society with the growing number of mental health cases.

Despite this, some may argue that distance learning enables students to procratinate, and cause a lack in social skills. When students are at home, they face a lot of distractions that appeal better than their schoolwork- Similar to a school environment, which could cause a descrease in their education and evidently their grades. However, all distractions students face have the opportunity of causing this. Distance learning also offers students the chance to gain a strong sense of responsibility, as it's up to them to communicate with their teachers for conferencing, etc.

6EF7CBB46501,"Title: The Importance of Following One's Heart in Pursuit of Success

As an 8th grader, I have often pondered the question of what it takes to be successful in the world. While some people believe that success requires following the crowd and doing what others do, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, success comes from listening to one's heart and pursuing one's passions, regardless of what others might say.

One example that comes to mind is my friend Sarah, who was pressured by her parents to become a doctor. She had always been interested in science and medicine, but as she grew older, she realized that her true passion lay in art. Despite her parents' disapproval, Sarah decided to pursue her artistic talents and is now studying graphic design in college. Her decision to follow her heart has led to her being happier and more fulfilled in her career than she would have been had she followed the path her parents wanted her to take.

It is important to make decisions using one's heart rather than relying on what others might say because it allows individuals to be true to themselves. When people do what they love, they are more likely to be motivated and dedicated to their work, which can lead to greater success in the long run. On the other hand, when people are influenced by others, they may end up in a career that they do not truly enjoy, leading to a lack of fulfillment and dissatisfaction.

While failure and making mistakes can be scary, they are also essential for growth and understanding what it takes to be successful. When people take risks and try new things, they learn from their mistakes and become better versions of themselves. For instance, if Sarah had not taken the risk of pursuing her passion for art, she may have never discovered her true talents and potential.

Finally, the benefits of following one's heart are numerous. Not only does it lead to greater happiness and fulfillment, but it also allows individuals to make a meaningful impact in the world. When people do what they love, they are more likely to be motivated to make a difference in their communities and in the lives of others.

F3593D9B1E95,"Have you ever seen a movie about aliens? Those green, bug looking creatures with big eyes and laser guns. Now, have you ever heard of the ""Face on Mars?"" If you have, then this is going to explain to you why the Face is a natural landform and not some monument created by aliens.

When NASA first saw the ""Face on Mars"" they claimed they spotted what the text states, ""the shadowy likeness of a human face."" The image was found when they were snapping photos of possible landing sights for Viking 2, one of NASA's spacecrafts circling the region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The passage later states, ""But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" The scientits even said it was just a landform. They stated that it has,""unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The scientists are not saying it's a alien monument either. They are just saying people could petray it that way.

A few days after this discoery NASA unveiled the image. When they unveiled it there was a capiton under it reading, ""huge rock formation."" NASA said the formation resembles a head and was formed by shadows giving the illusion of the facial features. This just made the Face a publicity stunt for most people. This might be when most would believe that it is some sort of a alien monument. But then NASA passed over the Face again and this time took a phots much greater then the last.

On April 5, 1988, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the ""Face on Mars."" They snapped picutres ten times sharper then before. The text states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site."" Thouands waited for the photo and what the photos unveiled were the truth. The photos revelead a natural landform, not any alien monument. Some people still believed that the structure was still an alien monument. But NASA learned that not all will believe.

All this evidence is just showing you that it is a natural landform. They have coordinates of this landform. They have amazing pictures just showing you that this is real. Even scientists examining the photos and showing exactly how what it is. What is it you must ask? It's a landform. NASA knew not all would believe but it made no sense to them. They supply so much evidence but still some just don't believe. The ""Face on Mars"" resembles a human head but shadows give it the illusion of a face.

In conclusion, the 'Face on Mars' is nothing more then a natural landform. We have photo proof of the Face along with scientists examining it and telling all who do not believe what it is. The Face is a natural landform. I have given you all the evidence. I have showed you that it's a natural landform. The only question is, do you believe it is?",0,persuade_corpus,,6

To begin with, texting and driving could be extremely dangerous when kids are in the car. First, while somebody is using their phone while driving, it could cause a big accident if they aren't paying attention to what's going on in front of them. There are more texting and driving accidents then drunk driving accidents. People mostly focus on their phone then focusing and staying behind the wheel not crashed into a tree.

Moreover, everyone knows getting stopped by the police isn't the best thing. The tickets cost a lot on money and sometimes is very hard to pay. Even some police may be harsh and might even take you in to court. Nobody wants to get stopped and pay for the price.

In addition, texting and driving is obviously not safe. Every year, at least 200,000 people experience accidents caused by texting while behind the wheel. The way the number keep increasing is honestly awful and so sad. I'm hoping that more in the future the number will decrease rather then increasing.

In conclusion, I have made my point that texting and driving is no where near acceptable. There is accident after accident each month & dealing with a loss is very sad. Not only can it affect whoever is in the car, but it can also affect those around.       ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
B407B3F81C9F,"Making decisions is an inevitable part of life, and people often have different opinions on whether to make their own decisions or seek expert guidance. While seeking expert guidance can be helpful, there are also pros and cons to making decisions on your own.

One of the main advantages of making your own decisions is that you have complete control over the outcome. You are free to make choices based on your own values, beliefs, and preferences, without the influence of external factors. This can lead to more personal satisfaction and fulfillment, as you are able to make decisions that align with your own goals and aspirations.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to making decisions without seeking expert guidance. For example, you may not have access to all of the relevant information or perspectives, which could lead to a less well-informed decision. Additionally, your personal biases and beliefs may cloud your judgment, leading to a decision that is not in your best interest.

There are many examples of personal choices and decisions that people have made without expert advice. For example, many entrepreneurs start their own businesses without any formal training or experience in the field. While this can be risky, it can also lead to great success if the individual is able to identify a need in the market and develop a product or service that meets that need.

Another example is the decision to pursue a certain career path. Many people choose their careers based on their personal interests and passions, without seeking expert guidance on which careers are most likely to be successful or profitable. While this can lead to personal satisfaction, it may not always be the most practical or financially stable choice.

Despite the potential drawbacks of making decisions without seeking expert guidance, there are many examples of individuals who have made successful choices based on their own intuition and instinct. For example, many famous artists and musicians have pursued their careers without any formal training or education, relying instead on their own creativity and passion.

Ultimately, the decision to make your own decisions or seek expert guidance is a personal one, and depends on the individual's values, beliefs, and goals. While seeking expert guidance can be helpful, there are also many examples of individuals who have made successful decisions based on their own intuition and instinct. It is important to consider the potential drawbacks and benefits of each approach, and to make a decision that aligns with your own goals and aspirations.",1,mistral7binstruct_v1,,0
0b8bcd319450_04112023,"While summer is meant to be a break from regular schooling, summer projects can help students continue learning and practicing important skills during their time off. When given the choice between teacher-designed or student-designed summer work, student-designed projects are generally preferable as they allow for more creativity, choice and engagement. 

When teachers design summer projects, they risk feeling like an extension of the normal school workload rather than an opportunity for enrichment. Students may see teacher-assigned work as yet another obligation instead of a chance to explore their own interests. This can diminish students' motivation and energy for their summer learning. In contrast, student-designed projects empower students to follow their passions and natural curiosity. By letting students choose their own topics and mediums, they are more likely to immerse themselves in meaningful research and creative works.

However, fully open-ended student projects also run the risk of becoming too unstructured or unfocused if students are not given any guidance. An ideal approach would be for teachers to provide some topic options within different subject areas or learning standards, but then let students select which one most interests them. Teachers could also suggest a variety of formats for presenting their projects, from essays and presentations to art pieces, videos or podcasts. Giving students choices within a framework helps direct their efforts toward educational goals while still allowing room for individual interests and styles of learning to shine through. 

In summary, summer projects are most effective when they balance student choice with teacher guidance. Student-designed work within clear parameters helps foster engagement, creativity and independent learning - skills that will serve students well inside and beyond the classroom. When the purpose is to sustain learning during breaks rather than simply evaluate it, flexibility and enthusiasm should take priority over uniformity and control.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,6

Subject: In Support of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider the importance of its preservation in our democratic system. While some argue for a shift towards a popular vote method for electing the President of the United States, I believe that the Electoral College provides crucial benefits that would be lost in such a change.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes, even though he won only 51.3% of the popular vote. This discrepancy highlights the importance of the Electoral College in preventing disputes over close elections. With the winner-take-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state results in a landslide electoral-vote victory. This system guarantees a clear victor and helps maintain stability and confidence in our electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the representation of all regions of our country. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which incentivizes candidates to campaign in various states and engage with a diverse range of voters. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that the president will represent the interests and concerns of citizens from different regions. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected and helps create a more united and balanced outcome.

Thirdly, the focus on swing states in a winner-take-all system encourages candidates to listen to voters and address their concerns more effectively. Voters in these states become highly engaged and informed, as they play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the election. This leads to a more thoughtful electorate, ensuring that the most informed citizens have a say in choosing the president.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a balance of power between large and small states. While the Senate's mal-apportionment can disadvantage large states, the Electoral College gives them more attention during campaigns. A candidate's victory in a large state like Florida will result in a higher number of electoral votes compared to a victory in a less populous state like Wyoming. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on densely populated areas and consider the concerns of citizens across the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner. This avoids the complications and delays that would arise if no candidate were to receive a majority of the votes. The certainty offered by the Electoral College allows for a smooth and efficient election process.

While some argue that a popular vote method would be fairer or more democratic, it is important to consider the practical benefits that the Electoral College provides. It ensures certainty, promotes the representation of all regions, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial element of our democratic system. Its preservation is vital to maintain stability, representation, and balance in our elections. I urge you to strongly consider these points when making decisions regarding potential changes to our electoral process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the information provided and make an informed decision that best serves our nation and its citizens.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,radek_500,,6

In German Suburds 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move in the German Suburb. They would sell thier car(s), and live without a car, and live a less stressful life. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two. I'm sure Heidrun wasn't the only one who felt like that.

Having no car wouldd take more stress of your life then you think. You wouldn't have to pay a car payment every month. You wouldn't have to worry about hvaing to pay for gas to get around. Lastly you wouldn't have to worry about getting into a car accident every time you got behind the wheel of a car.

""All of our development since World war ll has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" said David Goldberg. Goldberg is right. We put most of our attention and development into cars, and focus more on them than we really should. We don't really realize what damage cars are causing us yet, and probably won't realize for a long time from now.

Aftrer days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with even numbered license plates were orded to leave thier cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. The same would apply to odd number plates the following day. They should not only be doing this in Paris but everywhere to reduce the air pollution. The fine should be higher also to those who don't follow the rules. Unless you havea real emergency to use your car the day you are not suppose to then don't use it.

Not using cars would be a huge problem solver to most of us. It will help with air pollution. It will help with finacial problems by not having to worry about car payments or money for gas. Lastly it will help wiith the stress in people's lives and lower it.       Â      ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

Technology, such as phones, laptops, or any devices, is not always true. They can predict about how people feel or their emtions. For example, in the second paragraph in the first sentence, it says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"".

Every people have different types of emotions. It's true that they have different kinds of emotions but what if it is fake? Computers are like robots. Computers can't prefer if someone is smiling or upset. Computers don't understand if someone is really smiling for real or faking smiling. It depends on someone's face. For instance, when a friend talk something fun, I smile but when a friend talk something boring, I smile too so they can be happy.

Is putting on a happy face actually work? I prefer not because it depends on someone's emotions inside instead of the outside. Not everybody can read someone's mind. In the last paragraph in the second sentence, it says, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"".

D8CF376FEE74,"As we get older we want to travel to more places and get there faster, what if their was a quicker way without using cars. Certain places have been introducing a new concept, they calll themselves suburban pioneers. They live in places that have little or no cars, besides for the occassional bus, and all the stores that they would normally drive to are much closer now. Their are many benificial points to this new way of life such as a dramatic drop in greenhouse gasses, a stress free way to live, and also who doesn't desire to save a buck or two. If people start to limit the usuage of cars this planet might actually become a safer more joyful place to live.

In the past years greenhouse gasses have skyrocketed. The ozone layer is now trapping car exhaust fumes in earth and leading to what some might call global warming. Summer becomes hotter and longer, vice versa with winter. The U.S alone isÂ  to blame for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emission. In europe it's 12 percent which is still quite a grave deal. Causes of not cutting back on the use of cars leads to tragic events such as the one that unfolded in Paris. Thier was so much smog in the air from motorized cars that for five days no one could start their cars unless they had a wish of paying a pricey fine. If people start to diminish the use of cars we can restore this humble planet to its former glory.

Forking out money for a car and having the luxory of fixing it up everytime a piece falls off or something malfunctions can become expensive quite rapidly. Who doesn't crave to save money anyways? Those who have chosen the suburban pioneer way of living have saved enormous enough of money. They don't have to pay for the insurance of the car and they don't have to pay to fix up the ole' rust bucket. Though some would rather have a car, but those who drive do the honors of car pulling which might not be the most time saving mechanism but in the long run it truely is beneficial. Also the government gains from all this. The government pays to build highways and roads for your car, but if cars aren't so common as time goes by roads get shorter and people start to get paid more because of all the money that the government is saving. Though money can't make us happy is still is an important piece to own in life.

In retrospect cars cause a lot of stress related problems. Everyone has one of those days where they wake up late and then suddenly remember that they have to get across town in a few minutes. Yes a car could get you there in less than no time, but wouldn't it be much simpler if you could just walk a closer distance. With the desecration of cars, stores and outlets would be much closer to your home. The stress of forgetting something at home and then having to drive 30 minutes to go get it would be diminished. Families could have more interaction with each other which means a closer bond could be formed. Receting the number of cars wouldn't be such an inhuman thing to do if you knew that the outcome was far more appealing.

To sum up, limiting the number of cars that roamed this earth would be more of a gain than a loss. Cars create hazardous gasses that are released into the air that are slowly but surely rendering us useless. Cars also cause safety hazards that can lead to a stressful environment. Plus if you don't use a car as often or get rid of it all together you can retain money for more important matters such as bills for your house or maybe a well deserved vacation. The posibilities are endless if we begin to limit the use of cars.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8

Some individuals may adjust their opinion based on their initial impressions to achieve the best outcome or to have the best answer, but not everyone can achieve this. However, people always try their best to achieve it. I disagree with this viewpoint because, from my experience, it is difficult to change one's opinion once it has been formed, but it is possible if one tries their hardest. My mother always advises me to change my first impression if it is incorrect because it will make me more secure in my actions and lead to a better and safer life.

She emphasizes the importance of being careful with our choices because they will affect our future. Sometimes, we need to consider our choices carefully, and I believe that changing our first impression can lead to a better outcome. However, it is essential to be honest with ourselves and accept our initial impressions, as they can provide valuable insights into a situation. If we change our first impression too often, we may lose touch with our true feelings and beliefs.

In conclusion, while the first impression can change our opinion, it is essential to be honest with ourselves and consider our choices carefully. We should strive to make the best impression, but we should also be aware of the potential risks of changing our initial impressions too often.

CFC85AA6EB00,"The creation of the Facial Action Coding System has the potential to be very innovative and useful in today's society. In schools, teachers often have difficulty obtaining the attention of students and maintaining it when they have it. This could be a result of the way they are teaching, and how it makes the students feel. The use of FACS in all classrooms would be found valuable.

Problems such as obtaining attention could easily be solved with the use of the FACS. If students are placed in a classroom, and are unhappy and bored, they are less likely to pay attention and learn at the rate they are capable of. The FACS can record these students' emotions and help change the method of teaching used in that class to interest the students. As stated in the passage by Dr. Huang, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This could potentially change the students attitude towards learning for the better.

A teacher is capable of understanding verbal communication better than that which is nonverbal. Unless a student tells their teacher he or she is confused or bored, the teacher has little to no way of knowing this. Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" The FACS is able to detect such forms of emotion, and make corrections based upon them. This process makes the FACS more capable of dealing with these situations than any teacher.

Emotion is displayed often through facial expressions. Certain muscles in your face respond to specific emotions you are feeling at the time. It is not uncommon for a student to put on a fake smille or expression of understanding towards a teacher when he or she is bored and could care less. A teacher may have some difficulty understanding if the student's emotions are real or fake. Luckily the FACS recieves data from the recognition of movement in muscle tissues. The FACS is programmed to recognize which muscles move during each emotion. To provide an example the author explains, ""But in false smiles, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" SInce a different muscle is used in fake smiling than in that which is real, the FACS can tell the difference between the two expressions with ease.

The facts about FACS suggest that it is a perfect candidate for the use of innovative technology in the classroom. This system can improve the learning rates, as well as the mental growth of the students in a classroom. FACS can easily be proven valuable in all classrooms, as well as in many other environments among modern society. FACS proves that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

However, after thorough analysis and research, it is evident that the ""face"" is not an alien artifact but rather a natural landform. This essay will argue against the belief that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, using claims supported by evidence from the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

Body:

Firstly, the idea that the Face on Mars was sculpted by intelligent beings stems from pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon where the brain perceives familiar patterns or shapes in random data. In this case, the human mind tends to see a face due to our innate tendency to recognize faces. According to Dr. Michael Malin, a geologist at San Diego State University, ""...the human brain is wired to look for faces."" Furthermore, he explains that the Martian ""face"" lacks distinct facial features when viewed at higher resolutions, suggesting it is merely a trick of light and shadow playing on a mesa.

Secondly, the notion that the Face is an artificial structure defies logical reasoning. If we assume that aliens did indeed carve this feature, why would they choose to create a monument resembling a human face? It seems far more likely that any advanced civilization capable of interplanetary travel and terraforming would leave more definitive evidence of their existence. Additionally, the size of the ""face,"" approximately 1.5 miles across, would require an enormous amount of resources and labor, raising questions about the practicality of such an endeavor.

Lastly, recent missions to Mars, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have provided high-resolution images of the Cydonia region where the ""face"" is located. These images reveal that the supposed ""face"" is merely a mesa with natural formations mimicking facial features. Vincent DiPietro, a computer scientist who worked on the Viking mission, analyzed these new images and concluded, ""It looks like a normal mesa with erosion and landslides.""

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the belief that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact stems from pareidolia and lacks substantial evidence",1,falcon_180b_v1,"You have read the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

I remember the time when I first learned how to play the guitar. It was during my summer vacation, and I was determined to master it. I practiced for hours every day, my fingers sore and my mind focused on the chords and strumming patterns. It wasn't easy, but with persistence and dedication, I finally got it! It was an incredible feeling, knowing that I had accomplished something I never thought I could do.

Mastering something can be a game-changer. It boosts your confidence and makes you feel more capable of tackling new challenges. When I started learning how to play the guitar, I thought it was just a fun hobby, but it actually helped me in other areas of my life. For instance, it taught me the importance of perseverance and hard work, which I can apply to my schoolwork and other areas of my life.

But here's the thing â once you've mastered something, it's easy to get complacent and stop learning. I mean, I already know how to play the guitar, so why bother practicing anymore? But that's not the way to go. Continuous learning and growth are crucial for personal and professional development.

One way to continue learning is by exploring new areas of interest. For example, I've always been interested in music production, so I started learning how to use music software and producing my own beats. It's been a fun and rewarding experience, and it's helped me see the music-making process from a different perspective.

Another way to continue learning is by seeking out new challenges. For instance, I've started playing in a band with some friends, and it's pushed me to improve my skills and learn new techniques. It's also helped me develop my sense of rhythm and timing, which is essential for playing with a group.

I've also seen many examples of people who continue to learn and grow even after they've mastered something. For instance, professional athletes often work with coaches and trainers to improve their skills and stay ahead of the competition. Similarly, successful businesspeople are always looking for new ways to innovate and stay ahead of the curve.

In conclusion, mastering something can be a powerful tool for personal",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Think about a time when you have mastered something beyond what you were used to. How did it affect your ability to learn something new? Can you think of ways to continue learning and growing, even after you have mastered something?  Provide examples of how this was done by yourself or others.",7

Seeking multiple opinions when making an important choice or decision can greatly help someone make a better, well-rounded choice. Talking to more than one person allows you to get different perspectives on your situation and options. Each person you ask will likely have their own experiences, knowledge and point of view that can provide unique insights. 

Getting advice from different people prevents you from only hearing one side of the story. If you only talked to one friend, for example, you might be swayed by their personal biases or preferences without realizing it. Talking to others helps balance out any biases. It also exposes you to variables, pros and cons, or solutions you may not have considered on your own. The more inputs you have, the more well-informed your decision will be.

People also have different strengths, areas of expertise and ways of looking at problems. One friend may give practical advice based on logic while another offers more emotional support based on similar past experiences. By getting guidance from multiple sources, you benefit from different ways of thinking without relying too heavily on any one person's perspective. You can then weigh the merits of each piece of advice and piece things together in a way that makes the most sense for your situation. 

In the end, you have complete control over which opinions to incorporate into your decision. But exposing your decision to review by more minds increases the likelihood of gaining valuable new input that leads to a choice you feel confident and comfortable with in the long run. The extra time it takes to seek multiple opinions is well worth it for an important decision that will affect your future.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,4
falcon_180b_v1_656,"The issue of raising the minimum wage in our country is a topic of much debate. While some argue that it is necessary to ensure that workers are paid fairly and can support themselves and their families, others contend that raising the minimum wage would have negative economic consequences. After careful consideration of the various factors involved, I believe that raising the minimum wage is necessary to address issues of income inequality and improve the lives of low-wage workers.

One of the main reasons why I support raising the minimum wage is that it would help to reduce income inequality in our society. According to recent statistics, the top 1% of earners in our country earn more than 40 times what the bottom 90% earn. This is an unsustainable situation that has negative consequences for our economy, as it limits the purchasing power of the vast majority of our citizens. Raising the minimum wage would help to address this issue by giving workers at the bottom of the income ladder a much-needed boost.

Another reason why I support raising the minimum wage is that it would help to lift many workers out of poverty. Currently, many workers in our country earn wages that are below the poverty line, even if they work full time. This means that they struggle to make ends meet and are often forced to rely on government assistance programs to survive. By raising the minimum wage, we could ensure that these workers are paid a fair wage for their labor and can support themselves and their families.

Finally, I believe that raising the minimum wage would have positive economic consequences. Contrary to what some opponents of raising the minimum wage argue, studies have shown that increasing the minimum wage does not necessarily lead to job losses or reduced economic growth. In fact, some studies have found that raising the minimum wage can actually stimulate economic growth, as it gives workers more money to spend on goods and services. This, in turn, can create new jobs and help to drive economic growth.

In conclusion, I believe that raising the minimum wage in our country is necessary to address issues of income inequality, lift workers out of poverty, and stimulate economic growth. While there may be some short-term costs associated with raising the minimum wage, I believe that the long-term benefits far outweigh these costs, both for workers and for the economy as a whole.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"The minimum wage is a contentious issue in many countries.

E926BE6F104E,"Working alone and working in a group have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the positive and negative aspects of working alone versus working in a group.

Working alone has its own set of advantages. For one, it allows for more personal control over the work. When working alone, you have complete control over your work, and you can work at your own pace without worrying about keeping others on track. Additionally, you have the freedom to make decisions without consulting others, which can be beneficial in certain situations. For example, if you need to make a quick decision, working alone can be faster and more efficient than working in a group.

However, working alone also has its own set of disadvantages. For one, it can be isolating. Working alone can make it difficult to bounce ideas off of others and get feedback on your work. Additionally, working alone can be stressful, especially if you are working on a project with a tight deadline. Without the support of others, it can be challenging to keep up with the workload and meet deadlines.

Working in a group, on the other hand, has its own set of advantages. For one, it allows for collaboration and the exchange of ideas. When working in a group, you have the opportunity to bounce ideas off of others and get feedback on your work. Additionally, working in a group can be less stressful than working alone, especially if you are working on a project with a tight deadline. With the support of others, it is easier to keep up with the workload and meet deadlines.

However, working in a group also has its own set of disadvantages. For one, it can be difficult to find a group that is compatible with your work style. Not everyone works the same way, and it can be challenging to find a group that is willing to work at your pace and in your preferred method. Additionally, working in a group can be less efficient than working alone. When working in a group, you have to coordinate schedules and work around the availability of others, which can slow down the work process.

In conclusion, working alone and working in a group have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Working alone allows for more personal control over the work and the freedom to make decisions without consulting others.

1AA901C2E32E,"Has any school ever forced you to do a sport or a school activity like student councilÂ or the year book. Because they have to me and I disagree with it. Because some people are just not meant forÂ sports and other activities and it might be hard on some parents cause not every body has time and money.

The first thing most people come in to trouble with when trying to do a school activities or sports is the money and time not every body is a work from home or a stay at home parent/guardian some people even work from 6am to 9pm and cant pick up there kids. The next problem is not every one has money to afford sports and they can get really expensive depending on which sport that you want to play.

Another problem is some kids do not like to be social and have anxiety which can help them but it might also really mess with them. Certain students that don't always like to talk which is something you always need for team work and extracurricular activitiesÂ like student counseling. The fourth problem is that some people are notÂ always in the best shape to play a sport and peopleÂ might make fun of them for when they play or do anything. The final thing is some people have medical problems like asthma where they can not run for long periods of time which you need in a sport.

A8BB150F53AB," In my opinion, I believe that technology is a valuable tool that can benefit society in numerous ways. One of the most significant advantages of technology is its ability to connect people from all over the world. With the internet and various communication platforms, individuals can easily communicate with friends and family members who live far away. This is especially beneficial in today's fast-paced world where people are constantly on the move and may not have the time to physically visit with loved ones.

Another way that technology has made a positive impact on society is through its use in education. Technology has revolutionized the way that students learn and has made it easier for them to access information and resources. With online courses and educational apps, students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, technology has made it possible for teachers to easily track and monitor student progress, which can lead to more effective teaching and better academic outcomes.

Furthermore, technology has made it easier for people to stay organized and manage their daily tasks. With the use of smartphones and other mobile devices, individuals can easily keep track of appointments, deadlines, and other important information. This can help to reduce stress and increase productivity, allowing people to focus on more important tasks and goals.

While some people may argue that technology is a distraction that prevents people from engaging in meaningful activities and relationships, I believe that it can actually enhance these experiences. For example, technology can be used to facilitate social interactions and make it easier for people to connect with others who share similar interests and values. Additionally, technology can be used to enhance the quality of experiences, such as virtual reality and augmented reality, which can provide immersive and engaging experiences that may not be possible otherwise.

In conclusion, I believe that technology is a valuable tool that can benefit society in numerous ways. From connecting people and facilitating education to helping people stay organized and manage their daily tasks, technology has the potential to enhance our lives and make them easier and more fulfilling.",1,mistral7binstruct_v2,"

darragh_claude_v7_161,"While distance learning allows for flexibility, I believe students would benefit more from attending traditional in-person classes. There are a few key reasons for this.

First, attending school in person allows for valuable interaction and collaboration between students. In a traditional classroom setting, students can work together on group projects, discuss concepts with peers during class, and build social relationships. This type of cooperation and teamwork is difficult to replicate from home through a screen. Distance learning makes it harder for students to problem solve together and challenge one another's ideas in real time. 

Second, being physically present at school helps create structure and discipline for students. It is easier for students to feel focused and motivated when following a scheduled routine of classes rather than learning from home, where distractions like phones, TV, chores, and cooking are more accessible. Some students may struggle to stay on task and complete their work without the accountability of being in the classroom.

Third, in-person school offers accessibility to teachers and other resources that may not be as readily available virtually. When students have questions or need help, teachers can provide immediate feedback and guidance in the classroom. However, through distance learning students have to wait for a response over messaging or video chat, which is not as convenient. Schools also have libraries, labs, and other facilities that enhance the learning experience but may be difficult to access remotely. 

While distance learning has its benefits like flexibility, I believe students have much to gain by attending traditional classes and interacting with instructors and classmates face-to-face on a regular basis. The in-person structure and on-demand assistance helps maximize engagement, collaboration, learning, and overall academic success. For these key reasons, students would be better served attending classes at school rather than from home via online instruction.",1,darragh_claude_v7,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

Have you ever been afraid of having your child drive due to the amount of accidents caused by driver's using their cell phone or any other hand held device? Driver's shouldn't be able to use their cellular devices while in operation of a vehicle. Not only because it directs their focus from the road. But it also increases the overall risk of driving on highways and interstates.

Now while driving your attention should be on two and only two things, the road in front of you and the driver's around you. If your using your cellular devices while driving that's one more thing you have to pay attention to. Not every human can multitask and those who can aren't able to do it well enough to have one hand turning the wheel the other holding a cell phone typing a response to your bestie about how Jacob is a terrible person while our eyes bounce back and forth between the screen and the road. What if while you take a few seconds to type a word a car comes speeding around the corner and you can't react fast enough to swerve out of the way. According to the studies on Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance in volume 27 number 4 details that multitasking is less effective due to your brain having to mentally shift tasks. Which cannot be afforded to do while driving on a open road with other people.

As well as the fact that driving while using your cell phone increases the risk of driving, not only for yourself but the other around you. Think about it if your distacted you are prone to make mistakes, which can be fatal when driving, if you were to turn a little too sharply or not enough it can easily lead to a crash. That puts not only you and the others in your car at risk but everyone else on the same road as well. According to the National Safety Council texting while driving has lead to an astonishing 1.6 million crashes PER YEAR. Now if the risk of crashing that high why take the chance?

Now some people may argue that ""I'm a better driver than others i can text and drive"" or "" No way that can happen to me."" One, get off your high horse their buckoo. Two, According to ACTUAL fact from the National Safety Council 1 in 4 for crashes in the United States will be caused by drivers texting and driving. Is your life really worth a 75% chance that you can get this last text off?

In conclusion, People shouldn't be able to text and drive. If you do you increase the risk of driving which isn't the best thing to do with a already risky activity with roads full of others that you can't tell what they're thinking. But you also distract yourself from the road and it only takes one mistake to cause a deadly crash. So knowing the risks is that last text to Sally really worth your life?

In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of each of these activities and why they should be considered as part of a well-rounded education.

Firstly, educational games are a fun and interactive way to learn. Games can be designed to teach a variety of subjects, from math and science to history and language arts. They provide a unique and engaging way to learn that can be difficult to achieve through traditional classroom methods. Games also provide immediate feedback, which can help students identify areas where they need to improve and adjust their learning accordingly. Additionally, games can be played individually or in groups, which can help students develop social skills and teamwork.

Board games are another great way to learn and engage with educational content. They can be used to teach strategy, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Board games can also be used to teach math and science concepts, such as patterns and sequences. Board games are also a great way to develop social skills, as they can be played with friends and family.

Science experiments are a hands-on way to learn about science. They provide students with the opportunity to explore and investigate scientific concepts in a safe and controlled environment. Science experiments can also help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as an appreciation for the scientific method.

Math competitions and chess tournaments are great ways to develop mathematical skills and improve problem-solving abilities. Math competitions and chess tournaments provide students with a challenging and competitive environment that can help them develop their skills and confidence. These activities can also help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as an appreciation for mathematical concepts.

Finally, science fairs are a great way to showcase scientific knowledge and skills. Science fairs provide students with the opportunity to explore and investigate scientific concepts in a hands-on and interactive way. They also provide a platform for students to present their work and receive feedback from experts in the field. Science fairs can also help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as an appreciation for scientific inquiry.

Learning From Afar

One of the biggest concerns in education right now is the issue of chronic absences. If a student misses too many classes during the school year, it is known as being chronically absent. This is common throughout all of Virginia, especially in places like Generic_City, which has an absence rate of over 50% for kindergartners, and a rate of around 24% for middle and high schoolers. Allowing students to take classes online will drastically decrease the absence rate by finding a way for students to be educationally present when they physically can't be.

The biggest reasons that children are chronically absent are because of the parent(s). In most cases, the parent either cannot provide transportation for their child to get to school or they cannot provide for the child immediately after school due to their own working hours. If the child's classes are now able to be taken anywhere, the parent no longer has to worry about commuting the child and they may possibly even be allowed to take the child to work with them, depending on the job and whether the employers policies would allow for such a thing. But these digital classes/video conferences would absolutely allow more students to participate in the education system that are currently being marked as absent because of their parent's situation.

Earlier this school year, I partnered with Generic_School and Generic_School and Generic_City to help spread awareness about the high chronic absence rate, specifically in kindergarten and high schools. The reason chronic absences need to be lowered in these two groups immediately , is because of their crucial educational role. Kindergarten is the foundation of learning for not only the rest of their educational journey, but also their lives. If they get a weakened foundation, they will be more likely to fall behind in later education. As for high schoolers, a chronic absence could mean that they don't graduate. Once you realize just how important it is for these students to be in school, the rates of over half of students and around a quarter of students is alarming. But due to those two aforementioned parental reasons, these students are falling no choice but to be falling behind both mentally and socially. If students are able to take classes from home, they can a) learn to communicate with/use technology from a young age, b) learn the educational curriculum without penalty, c) keep their social interactions between their friends intact, and d) continue to develop their brains for the future use of society.

Now, I know that it is unfair to assume that all families have wifi or access to a computer. When my dad was out of work for a few years, we had no internet at all. But Generic_School had just mandated use of Chromebooks, so many times we had to drive to a McDonalds to use their free wifi in order to do our homework. And when our car broke down, I went over to a friends house and we did our homework (on their wifi) together. But that might not be a possibility for some people, and I understand and respect that.

Education is one of the most important things that an American needs. It will help them to learn all the skills they need to use before they go out into society and try to further themselves to become the best person they can be.

C7DF7BFB175F,"As for cell phones, Cell phone use while driving statistics show that how this behavior are common and dangerous for teen drivers. During cell phones while driving, 1.2 million car crashes back in 2013 that involved drivers talking on the phone, and also involving text messaging. Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help a lot of families manage this dangerous at its risk. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking on social media post can take your brain off task while driving. Coupled with inexperienced and lack of driving skills, cell phones can be deadly for teen drivers.

Technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to be sure and be careful and explain to the teens to understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a commitment for teens not to use distracting devices while driving. Teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving any drawbacks. The benefits associated with not using a cell phone that includes, being able to pay better attention, being less likely to crash, and following the law. Texting and driving are really are really unhealthy for teens which can lead to death or a lot of trouble.

According to integrity insurances, traffic safety administration, texting behind the wheel takes a driver's eye off the road for an average of 4.6 seconds, which is the time it takes to go from one end zone to another. Texting while driving has now replaced drinking and driving as the leading cause of death of teenage drivers. Teens are not the only ones that are just guilty. According to the survey, conducted by AT&T, 49 percent of American adult drivers admitted they text while driving. In that same survey, their model predicted text messaging while being involved in 6-60 percent of all accidents in the U.S. High school students who experienced these types of accident are very terrifying for texting and driving. Typing text messages reduce a driver ability at a certain direction to the roadway, to respond to important traffic events and also control a vehicle while in the lane and to also show respect to other vehicles.

bb330bcf89df_04112023,"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important choice or decision can help one make a better, well-informed choice for several reasons.

Firstly, different people will offer diverse perspectives due to their varied backgrounds, experiences and ways of thinking. One person alone may not think of all the important factors or anticipate unintended consequences in the same way as others. Getting varied viewpoints allows one to see an issue or choice from multiple angles and get a more well-rounded understanding of it. 

Secondly, talking to more people increases the pool of knowledge and advice that is available. Even if only one of the people provides a vital piece of information or suggestion, it can make a real difference to the choice. For important decisions, it is better to cast the net wide and collect advice from different sources to ensure all possible considerations have been taken into account.

Furthermore, discussing a choice with several trusted individuals acts as a cross-check. If most people suggest similar advice or caution against a particular option, there is likely wisdom in their shared view. However, if advice is mixed or conflicting on some aspects, it flags the need for deeper research or thought on that part. Such cross-validation of opinions from multiple trusted sources strengthens the choice that is eventually made.

Finally, seeking counsel from others takes the pressure off one person to make a perfect decision alone. It eases the burden of responsibility. Discussing freely with competent friends, family or professionals and pooling collective insight is often less stressful than deciding singly. A choice informed by various perspectives ends up being well-scrutinized and rested on a surer foundation, bringing greater confidence.

In summary, considering advice from multiple people before an important decision allows one to benefit from diverse viewpoints, gather broader knowledge, validate advice through cross-checking, and arrive at a choice with more surety through collective discussion and insight. A decision informed by numerous credible opinions stands a far better chance of being a wise one.",1,darragh_claude_v6,,2

Limiting your car usage is beneficial because you could potentially save alot of money. Every time you need to put more gas in the car thats fifty dollars down the drain. Saving fifty dollars a week actually adds up very rapidly and be used on something you will enjoy. Instead of buying gas you can go to the movies with friends, go iceskating or even out for dinner. Money is an important role in our economy today and spending a large amount on transportation regularly doesnt sound proper. Having more money is something im sure everybody would enjoy, especially not wasting it on gas money.

Not using your car is also benificial because you can get more exercise by walking or riding your bike where you need to go. Exercising is something everybody needs to do to maintain a healthy lifestyle and also staying active. Instead of driving your car park in in your garage on go for a nice relaxing bike ride. And if you dont have a bike go for a walk. People everyday are getting bigger and bigger and dont realize how important exercise really is.

Every time you use your car it harms the environment. When you start your car..... Pollution.

I think that it is unfair that kids cant have sports or activities the one reason i say this is because sports and activities is not stopping kids to learn. I think if you take away sports it will hurt children because if the kid would like to be a football, basketball, soccer player he/she couldn't achieve that goal because the school is taking away sports and activities. I think that you should have these sports but kids with a d-f should not be able to participate in the sport or activity, so if a child is really interested he/she will step up and do what he/she can do to improve his/her grade. When your a student you just want to express yourself and have time off to join sports and games. Kids enjoy this and if you take this opportunity away from them they will be very upset. Sports and activities can also help you get into the college you would like to go to because when a child is joining a sport lots of college professors want to see that. Another thing i would like to point out is that lots of kids would like to have a prep rally and see there friends and family play that sport. Sense i am a student here i would dislike not having to play sports or do activities. When kids play a sport it takes there stress away and hypes them up so taking a sport opens there minds. Children this age just want fun and games so i do think this might be to much credit for them but it still wont be fair for the students not being able to become what they want to be when there older, Also being a student your in school for about eight hours and after school people would enjoy doing what they love and go to there sports and or activities.

F5CB9849B913,"Hey there!  So, you know how sometimes you're trying to do something, like study for a big test or work on a project, but you just can't seem to focus?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's happened to all of us at least once. And it's super frustrating because you know you need to get things done, but your brain just won't cooperate. 

But don't worry, there are ways to prevent inactivity and lack of focus!  First of all, it's important to find a comfortable and quiet place to work.  Like, if you're trying to study for a test, you shouldn't be in your super loud and crowded bedroom. You need a place where you can focus and concentrate without distractions.  And personally, I find that listening to music helps me focus.  It's like, my brain is too busy listening to the music to be distracted by other things. 

Another thing that can help is setting small goals for yourself.  Like, instead of trying to study for an hour straight, break it up into smaller chunks.  You know, like 15 minutes here, 15 minutes there.  That way, it doesn't feel so overwhelming and you can take breaks when you need to.  And don't be afraid to take breaks, like going for a walk or doing some stretching.  It's important to give your brain a break and recharge. 

But, let's say you've tried all those things and you're still struggling to focus.  That's when you need to find your own personal style.

Me as well as other scientists believe this because, we still don't know for sure that there's any life on Mars.

3B2C8BB36BD4,"Policy 1, kids do get distracted by their phones sometimes but that doesn't mean you should take them away completely, that will just get them to want to use it more and that means them not paying attention during class. Kids like to talk to each other if it's texting or talking face to face, and obviously face to face talking during class can be spotted fairly easily so they resort to texting. Or maybe if someone outside the school needs to get hold of them and doesn't have the schools number, then what happens? They can't answer until after school and by then it may be too late. Kids go crazy when they can't have something so just let them have it little by little, like candy.

If you take it away they'll go crazy after school and do it all then instead of doing their homework, or as I said before by using it in class. I mean with all these things that you can do on your cell phone these days like facebook, games, youtube, and of course texting, it's kind of hard not to check it during school.

I'm so tired of adults telling us to get off of our phones and ipods when they're on it more than we are. We know you love it so why are you taking that away from us?

First, I disagree because students should have a choice if they want to be apart of after school activities. Students should not be forced to do be apart of any extracurricular activities. If they do not want to apart they do not have to because students can make decisions for their selves.

Next, I disagree because some students do not have the time to be apart of any after school activities. Some students do not have time to stay after school everyday. Some students have jobs. Some students might have things planned with friends and family. Students have more important things to do.

As a student at this school I understand that their have been problems at school involving cell phones and you are interested in changing the policy on cell phone use during the hours of school.

I have looked at each policy and I believe that it is a better option to go with the first policy to allow the students to bring phones to school and let them use them during lunch and other free times.

The reason that I think this plan will work better, is because sometimes students need to call their parents to tell them things and that would not take away from the education that the student receives since it would be on the student's own free time and not in class.

I also believe that the second policy to not let students have cell phones at school could put a student in danger if he or she needed to call for help.

The self driving cars are never self driving, they still require the passenger to be there when it does not know what to do. The artical says "" The car can read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code."" This means that someone can send a wrong message through a computer, causing an accident. The death rate from car accident could rise with the development of the self driving car. Whith hearing that would you trust your child to be in that car?

People who agree to continue the development of these cars have many of theair own opinions. They say that the sensors on the car help make it safer.

They also might say that its a lot less stressful for the driver. The accepters of this product may also say that all safty measures are taken care of.

There are many things wrong with many of the statements above. The sensors on the car can go bad, how will the person know before its to late? How is a self driving car less stressful for the driver? If anything they would have to pay more attention to the road to make sure the car was working correctly. The safty procations of these vehicals rely on the driver noiticing the car is speakinging to it or that the seat is vibrating. Sometimes people do not feel my phone vibrate in their pocket or hear if for that matter, how are we suppoded to trust a car to alert you if we can not trust our phones.

Using this on humans isn't a good thing. If they want to keep an emotion hidden then I don't think it is a good idea to uncover it. How can the world be a positive place if the happy people who made you happy weren't actually happy. What if that person had a death of a family member and wanted to keep it a secret but some random person starts snooping around and tells everyone that that person isn't actually happy. Since the article can tell a fake smile from a real smile it could possibly happen. Now if the person gives you consent then it is fine but nobody should be able to read someones emotion.

Now the thing about the facial recognition being in a classroom might make it more interesting. It there was a way to make school more interesting than that would be great. I'm not sure how far it would go to make the students happy. It says that it could modify the lesson like an efective human instructor but how far would it modify it.

Whether it is achieving a goal, taking on a challenge, or breaking an old habit, setting goals and accomplishing them is essential. Achieving your goals can help you improve yourself, and provide a sense of satisfaction and pride. For instance, if you set a goal to get in shape, working out consistently and seeing results will give you a sense of accomplishment. Also, if you take on a challenge, like learning a new language, you feel more confident in your abilities. 

Another reason to accomplish something in life is to avoid boredom. Too often, people find themselves repeating daily routines, with no excitement or enthusiasm. By setting goals and challenging yourself, you can stay motivated and interested, and experience new levels of fun and energy. For example, if you like to play video games, you might challenge yourself to beat a new game or break a personal score. This will give you a greater sense of enjoyment when playing, as well as providing a sense of accomplishment. 

Finally, accomplishing something is a great way to gain pride in one's accomplishments. When you achieve something, you can look back and be proud of yourself. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small. For example, if you set a goal to save money, do something meaningful when you reach it, such as going out for dinner with friends or treating yourself to something special.

B6C28D93DD33,"Would driverless cars really be helpful to people if they were successfully made? They would probably turn out to be something great if manufacturers succeeded in making these cars. Cars like these sound just as good as flying cars in the future. However, driverless cars do not seem to be a good thing for society. There could be a few problems if this type of car was created and here are some of those problems.

Driverless cars are not good for the society if they are made. Firstly, people would be more lazy than they already are if introduced to this. We already have sensors to help us with driving, so what more do we need. People are already lazy enough today because of technology. This idea would not help society at all if it were introduced to us.

Secondly, in paragraph nine, they state that if one were to be in a car accident, on one will really know who is at fault. In addition to that, people could lie, saying that it was the car's fault, thus people would blame the manufacturers. There could be a lot companies sued because of car accidents and of people who do not want to tell the truth. Also, what happens when a driverless car hits a pedestrian? Driverless could do a lot of bad things and it would all fall on top of the company.

Lastly, there is truly no point in making driverless cars because the driver is not doing a lot in the first place. People know how to drive already and there is no point in making a car that does everything that the driver can already do. This goes back to the laziness part. People also know that there's no point, but yet they decide we should have it because of their laziness. These are some reasons on why driverless cars are not good for society.

Driverless are not a good idea and should not be introduced to society. Honestly, it would step up our game with technology, but we should not waste with something like a driverless car. We can do so much more with this kind technology and should not take it for granted. We should be using our brains for thinking of a way to stop global warming or even the flying car idea sounds nice. To cnoclude, creating driverless cars is not a good idea.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
B3341D036468,"Summer-break, which traditionally takes place in June/July and ends August/September, is a great time off, a far distance given from the classroom. Because of this great distance from a learning environment and the fact that the summer break is the longest out of every other break in the school year, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they keep up to speed, with school content. These summer projects are traditionally teacher based, but recent years have given students more freedom. However, these summer projects should remain teacher-designed because of the content covered in the classroom, as well as the teacher having knowledge on what material will be covered in that following year after summer break, given that they actually end up teaching the content planned for that year, which is a valuable insight for the students. Additionally, many students are still in touch with the classroom environment, and it gives a smoother transition to those students who come back from their periodic break.

Teachers in the classroom face a struggle, that comes after the periodic amount of time that summer break takes. What will the content consist of? What will be the new learning objectives for the students when they come back from their break? That is why during the summer break, teachers designing specific projects that aim to target learning objectives that they themselves know, are important for the students to get a grip of, as well as still sticking to the curriculum, which greatly benefits students in the way that they actually get a sneak peek of what next year's curriculum could be built as. In addition to this, students get valued ""class time"", so even though they might be on their summer breaks, and they might not possibly do the projects to the best of their abilities, they are still soaking up valuable education time that you could only gain in class. For example, in schools that do not hand out or require students to complete projects during the time of the summer break, these students tend to forget some important learning objectives, simply due to the fact on how much time students have spent outside of school. But those who do indeed assign summer projects, give students a peek into the upcoming school year, which definitely does give a boost to the students preceding knowledge prior to the school year, as well as encouraging possible additional studying, which all leads to a future of a bright learning environment.

Another important factor on why it is essential for schools to give out teacher-designed projects is to bring out more of the ""integration period"", or coming slowly, back to the school environment in order to prepare them for learning. Teachers find this valuable so that they can get their students ""accustomed"" to their classroom environment before even stepping through the door, which is very precious for most teachers, given that in a school year, teachers take around a month and a half before all the assignments and daily motions become routine. In a time where every period counts, this is a major victory for teachers, as their designed projects can go over and reflect on the material that they hope to teach their students, which gives them a starting to the school year edge, above all. Students often struggle at the beginning of the year at first, because of the time they have taken off, without any classroom instruction, which is also an adjustment period. Teacher-designed projects enable students to take the initiative, while on vacation and step up to learn important material that has basis, and will be taught in class at some point.

Even though student projects allow for the students to choose their own projects, and whatever central topic of focus that they have the most interest in, students will still choose topics that might not be relevant to them in education, whereas teachers have the best idea due to the fact that they, and them only teach the curriculum. In addition, teachers know exactly what learning objectives are prioritized, while students might have a faint idea, but not close to what the teachers understanding of the goals and learning objectives that he might have set for his/her students. Specific examples would include how in English, summer reading projects would be assigned so that when the students returned back, they would have that ""touch"" with their books, and their education beforehand, so rather than deal with the trivial, novel things that teachers would normally do at the beginning of the year, they are allowed to follow the curriculum, full stretch.

In conclusion, teacher-designed projects help students due to the amount of content covered in the classroom, as well as teachers having knowledge on what will be covered after summer break which benefits students greatly, and begins the integration into the classroom, before even stepping foot into the classroom. This also alleviates the pressure on teachers greatly, as they can plan more accordingly giving their own designed summer projects to their students in the classroom. Students benefit from this due to how they are accustomed earlier then usual in the classroom, while teachers are benefited due to how they are able to focus on specific learning objectives that might be of importance.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
A39660CA003E,"High school students should not be required to take music, art, and drama classes because these subjects are often seen as secondary branches of a student's educational career. It is impossible to deny the importance of these subjectsâstudents should have the opportunity to explore their creative passionsâbut for many students, their primary focus is on more academic classes. Often, in order to make room for these subjects, students need to sacrifice other classes, such as math, science and language, which are essential for preparing students for college. By not requiring these creative classes, students can dedicate more time to the core subjects that are necessary for succeeding in the long term. 
 
Furthermore, the benefit of enrolling in music, art, and drama classes is largely individual. While some students may gain tremendous value from these classes, others may not find the same utility in them. This makes it difficult to justify a blanket requirement across the entire student body as it would not be a beneficial use of time for everyone. If the classes are optional, students can choose to take them if they think it suits their individual interests, and teachers are able to create classes tailored to their students' needs. 

In conclusion, music, art, and drama classes should not be required for high school students. This would ensure that students have the freedom to choose the classes that are best suited to their individual interests, and make room for the academic classes that are essential for college preparation.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Write an essay arguing that music, art, and drama classes should not be required for high school students, and providing an explanation of why.",9
FA6AF2AFC743,"Dear state senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME and i am here today to talk to you about wether or not you should keep the Electoral College. In my opinion i thibk that it would be easiewr to vote for the president by the number of popular votes that he recieves. In this letter i am going to explain to you why i think that its easier if we do this so please make sure you can read through this whole letter.

The first thing we need to know before starting to read this letter is that the Electoral college is basically a widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democractic mehtod of selecting a president that ought to be rules. Many people in the United States and in other places all over the world always face difficulties wether or not they like the Electoral College. If you acually think about it, in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for the slate of the electors who then vote for the president. So the people that are voting for these electors are not getting the direct vote. They are not getting sufficent amount of power to vote for the person that is going to rule their life.

A very important key that we asll have to know is that the electoral college is unfair for the voters. Candidates dont spend time on states that they know have no chance of winning. People cant put the fate of the presidency in the hands of a state that only have candidates because the candidates know that they might have a chance on winning!! And i do understand that we cant change this because some people dont like it but that is because people do not understand what the Electoral College is in the first place.

So dear mr.senate please do something to abolish the electoral college. Its is unfair and irrational. Thank you for taking your time to read this letter and dont hesistate to call me whenever you need to.

Sincerly,

1C088E6CD17E,"As society becomes more reliant on technological advances, many individuals are now granted the opportunity to take online classes at home. Essentially, school systems have modernized their methods of providing various approaches towards an efficient education. Although virtual learning provides a more personalized learning experience for students, the consequences of implementing online classes outweigh the benefits.

Online classes can hinder the development of social skills within individuals. The classroom setting and environment offers students a wide variety of ways to exercise their social skills and develop character by interacting with different individuals. For an example, many individuals who are confined inside their homes are unable to participate in healthy activities that involve engaging with other students such as sports, clubs, organizations, and other extracurricular activities. Oftentimes, the individual who finds themselves being accustomed to this way of learning have identified themselves as ""anti-social"" or socially awkward. This is due to the fact that they prefer to isolate themselves from group settings or from social events because they are apprehensive and, sometimes even, hostile towards others who attempt to change their habits. Some may argue that online classes have the ability to engage its students with insightful discussions with their teacher and peers online. However, physical presence plays a vital role in developing relationships and allowing students to overcome their social anxiety. Like any technological application, individuals typically use online platforms and sites to display a persona and in this case, online classes encourages these students to strengthen their online presence, but not their physical one. In terms of longevity, this method does not strengthen crucial life and work skills that they are expected to have when they join the workforce; it is simply unrealistic. These students are encouraged to hide behind a screen because they lack social skills, and they justify this practice because the education system glamorizes the idea of their innovative society.Â Overall, online classes not only affect their learning experience, but their social skills.

Furthermore, online classes are not preparing individuals to face the reality of the workforce and the legitimacy of this method is ambiguous. The whole purpose of providing the youth with education is to be able to train them to become independent enough to be self-sufficient in the real world. In a school or classroom environment, they learn valuable teamwork skills that allow them to cooperate and collaborate with other individuals about how to approach an issue, overcome challenges, and propose a solution. This eventually leads to the building of bonds and relationships that could impact an individual's life or mental health, whereas online schooling encourages the opposite effect of this. By physically going to school, these individuals nurture their abilities to be problem-solvers and natural thinkers. Additionally, some students may not take online classes seriously as opposed to physically showing up for class. For an example, online students may not require a time constraint and does not require the students to be properly dressed for the ""class."" Sometimes, the individual may present themselves to an online class in their pajamas because they woke up an hour ago. This does not exemplify sophistication nor does the class seem respected. On the other hand, if the student were to show up to school, they would look much more prepared and willing to learn. This highlights the difference between individuals who value their education and the ones who do not.

Lastly, online schooling does not account for individuals with learning disabilities. Most schools consist of people from various races, ethnicities, backgrounds, sexes, and learning capabilities. Not every student thinks the same way, so they should be encouraged to express their creativity to establish a diverse school setting. Additionally, some students may possess specific learning disabilities such as ADHD, dyslexia, autism, mental illnesses, and more. In this case, these students require much more attention from their teachers to help guide them through this process, but an online class can only do so much. The teachers may be going at a faster pace than what these students can normally handle or they are confused about a certain area of the subject, so their frustrations may build up and lead to detrimental effects on their mental health. Although it is considered to be personalized learning, these individuals require careful guidance towards achieving the same success that their counterparts are experiencing. In the sense of virtual learning, these individuals are at a disadvantage because their learning disabilities are beyond their control. Video conferencing may be an option, but students with learning disabilities prefer not to share with their peers that they are struggling in a certain area or having difficulties understanding the curriculum, but would much rather keep this information confidential between themselves and their teachers.

By implementing online classes, schools should reassess the validity of its efficiency and the impact it will have on students. Virtual learning can have benefits, but is effective to a certain extent. Ultimately, the negative imbalance between the consequences and benefits of virtual learning suggests that online classes should not be encouraged within school systems and to continue to maintain a traditional form of education.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
F49521C3494B," In some schools, there are programs that pair older students with younger students, and the older students can assist younger students if they have difficulties with their education or any other problems. This program can be beneficial for both old and young students.

First, the older students can support the younger students by communicating with them if they are facing challenges with their studies, with other students, or with issues outside of school. They can help the younger students find solutions to their problems so that they can feel better.

Secondly, this program can help the older students by teaching them responsibility. By assisting the younger students in improving their school subjects, the older students can improve their own confidence in themselves. They can also learn how to work effectively with others, which can be valuable skills in their future careers.

Lastly, at the end of the day, the older students will have a positive experience knowing that they helped a younger student to improve their school performance and communication skills. They can also learn from the younger students, which can broaden their perspectives and make them more open-minded.

darragh_claude_v7_482,"While distance learning offers flexibility, I believe that attending classes in person provides greater benefits to students. There are several reasons why face-to-face classes are preferable to remote learning from home.

Firstly, being physically present at school allows for more focused learning. At home, students may face distractions from siblings, chores, or technology that reduce their ability to concentrate fully on their schoolwork. In a traditional classroom setting, teachers can more easily maintain an environment conducive to learning without outside influences. 

Secondly, learning from home can leave students feeling isolated from their peers. Part of the educational experience is collaborating with and learning from other students. Direct social interaction at school fosters relationship-building skills and teamwork. It also gives students opportunities for discussions and questions that may be more difficult remotely. 

Finally, attending classes in-person gives students experience that prepares them for their future. Most careers will require showing up somewhere other than home each day and interacting face-to-face with colleagues. Being present at a school helps develop important time-management, social, and professional skills. It also provides equitable access to extracurricular activities like sports teams that support well-rounded development.

While distance learning has its place, especially in unique circumstances, I believe the social and career-preparatory advantages of face-to-face school outweigh those of remote schooling from home as a long-term learning model. For most students, being physically present at their school of enrollment leads to better educational outcomes and a more well-rounded high school experience. That is why attending classes in-person remains preferable to distance learning as the standard option.",1,darragh_claude_v7,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

CE2EC298670A,"Sure, here's my essay on the advantages of schools offering distance learning, the challenges faced by students who have to take care of their kids or lack family support, the financial difficulties of pursuing education, and the experiences of older students who are trying to catch up on their education:

Distance learning has become a popular option for many students in recent years, and for good reason. Offering flexibility and convenience, distance learning allows students to complete their coursework on their own time and at their own pace. This can be especially beneficial for students who have family or work commitments that make it difficult to attend traditional classes.

However, not all students have the same opportunities when it comes to distance learning. Some students have to take care of their kids or lack the support of their families, making it difficult for them to pursue their education. These students may have to juggle their responsibilities with their schoolwork, leading to added stress and challenges.

Another challenge that students face when trying to pursue their education is financial difficulties. The cost of tuition and other expenses can be a significant burden for many students, particularly those who are struggling to make ends meet. This can lead to students having to take on part-time jobs or even drop out of school altogether.

For older students who have not finished their education, distance learning can be a lifeline. These students may have had to take a break from their studies for various reasons, such as family obligations or financial constraints. With distance learning, they can now have the opportunity to catch up on their education and achieve their goals.

Despite the advantages of distance learning, there are also some challenges that students may face. For example, students may struggle with motivation and self-discipline when completing their coursework on their own. Additionally, they may not have access to the same level of support and resources as students in traditional classes.

In conclusion, distance learning can be a valuable option for students who are facing challenges in their personal or professional lives. However, it is important to recognize the challenges that students may face and to provide them with the support and resources they need to succeed. By offering flexible and convenient learning options, schools can help students achieve their educational goals and reach their full potential.",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

3A9A95F48F86,"Dear principal,

I think that policy one is the best policy to choose. I think its the best because kids these days enjoy to be on their phone whether its talking or texting or maybe even playing some games. I also think that it is best to use them during free time or during lunch periods because if we use them in class we will become unfocused and get bad grades and not do the work that was assigned to us because we were to busy on our phones talking to other people. Kids entertain themselves with their phones. I think that policy one is best for the kids. So they shouldn't be able to complain about this policy because they have enough time in lunch periods to talk or text. Plus they get more than enough free time in our classes. I also think that policy one is the best because what if one the kids have to use their phone because they are hurt or have something private like if they got dirty or that they got sick, they have to tell their parents while they are in school. But if policy two that's not going to be able to happen and the kids will be mad.

BA930ABE4928,"Online school has become more and more popular in the past years, which is possible today due to the evolving technology. Teachers upload the material and video chatÂ with the students to teach, and the students submit their finished work for the teacher to grade. This seems like a great way for students to learn at their own speed and to attend school even though you might not have a way to get to school.

Every student has their own learning speed and way that they learn best. I usually understand things pretty fast and do not have a lot of trouble learning atÂ a fast pace, many other students need more time to understand a topic and more explanation. When in a class room there is only a limited amount of time to ask questions or for the teacher to explain again. Every student also has their preferred way of learning. Some keep most information when they write it down over and over again, some are more visual and need graphs or pictures, and others have to try ore build things to learn. This amount of individuality is often not possible if you are in a class room with twenty-five other students.

When I was in eight grade we learned about Australia in English class, and how the kids who live in he middle of the outback use online school and video chatting to do their school work. Australia is not the only place where that would be handy; students here in the US live very rural sometimes too and take a very long time to get to school. If they could do their school work online they would not have to go through the trouble and could to their work from home. This would also come in handy if you have a severe illness or injury and it is impossible for you to attend school for an extended amount of time. The student could do their homework from home or a hospital and not miss months of classes and possibly have to redo the entire year.

However this is not a fit for everyone. Some need more help and assistance that can not be provided through a screen but has to be done in person. I like having the opportunity to talk to my classmates about the topic or ask questions directly to the teacher. I find it easier to understand, especially difficult topics, when they are explained to me face-to-face.

Online school may not be something for everybody and I believe that everyone should decide for themselves personally if this would be something for them. IÂ prefer going to school and learning in a class room because I get easily distracted and would not actually learn anything if I was at home. Today, it is almost impossible to not use any kind of media and technology in your day to day life and it makes learning a lot easier. We have to find a middle point between not using at all and too much.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

Summer break is like, the best thing that happens to us students every year. I mean, it's like, we get to chill for like, a whole month without having to worry about school or homework or anything. And let me tell you, it's like, super important for our mental health and stuff.

First of all, summer break gives us a chance to relax and recharge. Like, after a whole year of learning and studying and being super focused all the time, it's nice to just chill and do nothing for a bit. It's like, our brains need a break from all the information and stuff, and summer break gives us that chance to just chill and unwind.

And it's not just good for our brains, but also for our physical health. Like, when we're not in school, we get to do more stuff outside and get more exercise. We can go to the beach or the pool, or play sports or whatever. It's like, way better than sitting inside all day doing homework.

Plus, summer break gives us a chance to explore our interests and passions outside of school. Like, if we're really into art, we can take a painting class or something. Or if we're into sports, we can join a league or camp. It's like, our chance to try new things and figure out what we're really into.

And let's not forget about the social benefits of summer break. Like, we get to hang out with our friends and family more and make new memories. We can go on trips or stay at camp or whatever. It's like, way better than being cooped up inside all day.

Now, I know some people might be like, ""But what about all the learning that happens during the summer?"" And yeah, sure, some learning does happen during the summer, but like, it's not as important as the benefits of having a long break.

85C71A1E0117,"Embracing one's individuality is a crucial aspect of personal growth and development. It is especially important in moments that are out of one's control, as these situations can be stressful and overwhelming. In such instances, it is easy to get lost in the crowd and conform to societal norms, but embracing one's individuality can help individuals overcome obstacles and achieve their goals.

One example of someone who overcame obstacles and embraced their individuality is Malala Yousafzai. Malala was born in Pakistan and faced numerous challenges growing up, including being targeted by the Taliban for her advocacy for girls' education. Despite these challenges, Malala never lost sight of her passion for education and her commitment to her individuality.

Malala's story is a testament to the power of individuality in the face of adversity. She refused to be silenced by the Taliban and instead chose to speak out for what she believed in. Malala's courage and determination inspired millions of people around the world, and her legacy continues to inspire individuals to embrace their individuality and fight for what they believe in.

Embracing one's individuality can also lead to personal growth and fulfillment. When individuals are true to themselves and their values, they are more likely to find happiness and success in their lives. This is because they are not trying to fit into someone else's mold or conform to societal expectations.

In conclusion, embracing one's individuality is essential for personal growth and development, particularly in moments that are out of one's control.

Knowing the emotions of students would allow changes to be made in the teaching of individual students. With technology, classrooms would be more effiecient, have better test scores and grades and would allow for a better development in education.

Using technology would help teachers see what method of teaching would be best for their classroom, based on feedback given from technology. If teachers would use technology in the classroom, they could make changes in the way they teach their students, allowing better efficiency in the classroom. With better efficiency less time could be spent learning and more strengthening of what students know.

Technology would also help classrooms have better grades and do better on tests. This would be possible by seeing the students that are bored or confused. With students that are learning better and understanding more, their grades are sure to increase, as well as their test scores.

BE0B394B4E9B,"For as long as they could remember, students have been attending school by following a structural path of their personal education. They take classes that teach them basic principles that they will contribute to their every day lives, as well as the future. As the world progresses in advancement, technology has played a vital role in expanding the education system. Some schools now offer an option for students to attend classes from their own home by online or video conferencing. This innovative and modern policy has been heavily debated upon if it is the right move for students to further their educational career. Although some may argue that distance learning may increase laziness for students, having them able to attend classes from home would overall benefit students by creating a comfortable environment, improving learning styles and creativity, as well as preparing them for college and future jobs.

Students spend a majority of their day at school and becomeÂ aware of their certain surroundings. They understand their school dynamic and environment, which contributes a vital role in their education. If a student is uncomfortable with the environment that is represented throughout the school, it will make them dread coming to school and unmotivated to learn. Students spend around seven hours of their day at school, and if they are in an hostile habitat, it will negatively impact their education. By forcing students to stay in a place where they do not feel comfortable, it will deprive them of the knowledge and experience they could be receiving. Having students work from home would allow them to create their own safe space that they will learn better in. They would be in a comfortable environment that they themselves are used to, and can prosper in. Online classes would benefit students by giving them the choice to leave an environment where they feel limited, for a place that they know would allow them to learn effectively.

Every student is different, and they all know what methods they personally learn best from. Teachers at school often disregard this, and they go on to teach all of their students the same way. They have no choice but to implement this, due of the vast amount of students they have and the deadlines of curriculum. This way of educating limits the potential of students, as they are constricted to one way of learning. By giving students the opportunity to take online courses, they would be able to practice the learning style they know is best fitted for them. This will overall lead to better retention and understanding of the work that is being asked of them. Students know themselves, and they know what works for them in regards to learning certain materials. This freedom of education will also promote creativity and allow them to come up with new ways and projects for themselves. By allowing students to take these online courses, they would be able to learn effectively and broaden their horizons of ideas.

Students go to school to learn ideals that they will one day use in the future for their own well being. Everything that is taught to them is meant to build their knowledge and invent new ways of innovation for themselves, as well as society. By having students attend their classes from home, it will prepare them for the college and work experience that is set out for them. In college, students work on assignments on their own digital devices and submit them to their professors online. This is how they learn and build off of their knowledge, a concept that could be taught at an earlier age through the developments of online classes. In addition, with the speed at which technology is developing, most jobs will ask their employees to have technological knowledge and skills. This will put students at a greater chance of obtaining these jobs with the online experience they have. By having students take up on distance learning, they will become better equipped for the future that is ahead of them.

Many may argue that online classes will make students more lazy and likely to procrastinate their work. Though in hindsight, these online courses will further teach students how to schedule their time and effort on their assigned projects. These students know what will happen if they procrastinate their assignments, and through this they are better prepared to finish their work with the resources available to them. Online classes will even give students the opportunity to get ahead of their work, since they are not following the same schedule the courses taught at the school go.

A student's education is very important, and it is emphasized on being a fundamental building block of their own life. By implementing the choice of online classes, students would be able to take themselves out of hostile environment for somewhere they know they could learn in. They would be able to explore different learning styles that they know are best suited for them, which goes to spark creativity in the work they put out. Online courses would also give students the opportunity to jump startÂ on their future and build habits that will benefit them for college and the work force. By having schools offer distance learning, their students would be able to prosper in ways that will benefit them for the rest of their educational career.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
3C9C907C66C8,"Dear, State Senator

I have recently read articles about the electoral vote system currently in place in the united states.

The electoral vote system elects other people, called electors, to vote for the people.Â  They basically vote for president, if you and many others vote for him/her.Â  I believe the electoral vote system is glitchy, outdated, and confusing to some.

The electoral vote system can be manipulated and unfair.Â  The electors can be choosen by state conventions, state central committees, and the candidates running for president.Â  If the president can choose his electors, could'nt he replace the orignal electors for new ones that will guarantee a vote for him.Â  The peoples vote would'nt matter.Â  This situation happened in the two-thousand election when George W. Bush won the election with more indivisual votes than electoral votes.Â  This violates our constitution which states, the government is controlled by the people and allows for change if enough people in the US want it.Â  If you've ever noticed that during the presidential election, candidates don't come to certain states.Â  In the electoral system, each state has a winner-take-all system.Â  When the state goes over their electoral votes, the winner with the most electoral votes takes all of them, while the electoral votes of the opponent gets no votes toward him.Â  This can cause mayhem, the non-counted votes can make a big diffrence in the election.Â  In nineteen-seventy six their would have been a tie if 9,246 voters in Hawaii and Ohio voted the opposing side.Â  The elections come close and without the popular vote which accounts for millions of people in America, we may have had better elections with less debates.Â  The electoral college contains 538 electors, out of those 538 their only 270 are mandatory to vote.Â  Each elector equals each member in your states House Of Represenatives and add two for the senate.Â  California has a population of 35 million and wyoming has a population of 500,000.Â  Wyoming having 5 electors and california having 55.Â  This doese'nt make sense because if a state may have a higher population than wyoming but yet still have less electors.Â  The system is very confusing in these ways causing some to vote for the wrong candidate and others thinking they are voting for the right candidate they believe is true .

The electoral votes are'nt the worst because we are still showing our democracy, showing off Americas greatnest in its government.Â  The electoral vote crisis in two-thousand rarely happens.Â  This situation has'nt happened since eightteen-eighty eight, its a rare occurance.Â  Electoral votes also make the playing field even.Â  If we had popular votes in place, then wouldnt the presidents have a landslide if they went to all the biggest populated states.Â  The electoral votes can allow ties and close elections to happen instead of land slides in many elections.

falcon_180b_v1_786,"""I read an interesting article about technology called the Facial Action Coding System that can identify human emotions. It made me think about whether it would be valuable to use this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

On one hand, it could be helpful for teachers to know how their students are feeling. Maybe a student is struggling with a topic and feeling frustrated, but they don't want to speak up in front of the class. If the teacher could see that the student was feeling frustrated through this technology, they could offer extra help or support without making the student feel embarrassed.

However, I also think it could be a bit invasive. What if a student is just having a bad day and doesn't want everyone to know how they're feeling? Or what if the technology isn't perfect and misinterprets a student's expression, leading to misunderstandings or even punishment for something they didn't actually feel?

Overall, I think it could be a useful tool, but it would need to be used carefully and with respect for students' privacy and emotions. Teachers would need to be trained on how to interpret the technology accurately and how to use it to support their students, rather than punish or embarrass them.""",1,falcon_180b_v1,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

Playing a sport in a community park is one of the most enjoyable ways to spend time outdoors. I think this because it's a great way to get some exercise, meet new people, and have fun.

First of all, playing a sport in a community park is a great way to get some exercise. Running around and playing games outside can help you stay healthy and fit. It's also a lot of fun! You get to run around and play with your friends, which makes it feel less like exercise and more like a fun activity. Plus, you don't have to worry about getting bored or feeling like you're missing out on something else to do.

Another reason why playing a sport in a community park is so enjoyable is that you get to meet new people. When you're playing a sport, you're surrounded by other people who are also there to have fun and get some exercise. This means you get to make new friends and connect with people who have similar interests. It's also a great way to learn new skills and techniques from other players.

Finally, playing a sport in a community park is just plain fun! There's something about being outside and enjoying nature that makes it feel like a special treat. You get to breathe in fresh air, feel the sun on your face, and hear the sounds of birds chirping and children laughing. It's a great way to relax and unwind after a long day of school.

Overall, playing a sport in a community park is an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors because it's a great way to get exercise, meet new people, and have fun. So next time you're looking for something to do outside, consider grabbing a ball and heading to your local community park!",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay exploring why playing a sport in a community park is an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors.,8

In paragraph 2 it says that Venus is considered Earth's ""twin"". They say that because they are simlar in shape and size. The one of the differences they have is speed.

EFBF293CC2AF," Dear Hospital Manager,

I would love to visit your hospital because I can imagine myself walking through those doors, feeling the excitement of being surrounded by medical professionals and the sound of life-saving machines. The sight of surgeons rushing to the operating room, the smell of sterilized instruments, and the knowledge that I am in a place where miracles happen every day is what draws me to your hospital.

I want to visit your hospital because I am passionate about the work that you do. The idea of saving someone's life, using cutting-edge technology and techniques, and making a real difference in the world is what motivates me. I am particularly interested in the different types of doctors that work in your hospital, from interns to residents, and the various specialties that are available. I think it's important to have a diverse team of medical professionals, each with their own unique skills and expertise, to provide the best possible care to your patients.

One reason why I want to visit your hospital is to learn more about the different medical specialties that are available. I am particularly interested in becoming a surgeon, and I believe that visiting your hospital would give me a better understanding of the skills and knowledge required to succeed in this field. I am also interested in learning more about the different types of surgeries that are performed, from routine procedures to complex surgeries that require specialized expertise.

Another reason why I want to visit your hospital is to gain a better understanding of the day-to-day operations of a hospital. I am curious about how patients are triaged, how procedures are scheduled, and how different medical professionals work together to provide the best possible care to patients. I believe that gaining a better understanding of these processes will help me to become a more effective medical professional in the future.

I also want to visit your hospital because I am passionate about making a difference in the world. I believe that every medical professional has the potential to make a real impact on the lives of their patients, and I want to be a part of that. I believe that by visiting your hospital and learning from the medical professionals who work there, I can gain the skills and knowledge needed to make a real difference in the world.

63F4D4192E13,"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is described by the author of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"". This system enables computers to identify six of the human emotions. This technology should be used to read the emotional expresiions of students in a classroom, because it is a very valuable technology.

Firstly, we should have this technology because it would help explain how people would be feeling on a certain subject, lifestyle or in everyday life. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" Since Dr. Eckman has programmed these emotions we can better understand how someone is feeling without having to ask him; each emotion inflicts a facial muscle movement which is recognised and is catagorized as an emotion.

In addiotion, we should have these identifiers because it could help students learn better. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This software could help someone who is easily distracted. This technology could find a way to help with this person, and the coding system could produce a lesson that this person can listen to and understand it because it was made for them.

Also, the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers and staff. Some students do not show what they are feeling. If this technology can figure out facial expressions then the teachers will know who is having a bad day, the teacher could then talk to this person privately and see how they are doing. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotuions, but also may even help produce them."" Since studies show that if a student smiles they could have a better day. The teacher could recognise that someone is feeeling down so they could say a funny joke and sprout an emotion into a particualr student.

In the final analysis, we should have the Facial Action Coding System in school because it will help students feel better and learn better. If a student does not want to go to school then they probably do not want to learn either. If this system can make someone's day then students would want to come to school, and teachers would then have students who want to learn. ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is a great article and the technology that is included in the article may be the next big thing. The first step for the coding system is to use the technology to read the emotional expression of student in classrooms. This technology can help a student throughout their school work. It can also help the teachers to teach more passionatly to students who want to learn and are not forced to come to school, but come voluntarily.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

22BCA723AFF7,"""All of our developement since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."", stated David Goldberg, accordind to author Elisabeth Rosenthal. Fellow citizens, the time has come to adress the complications of our over usage of cars. There are many advantages to limiting car usage that you need to take into consideration.Â  Less stress, reduced air pollution, and less money spent on such a worthless form of transportation. Sounds like an intriguing advantage, right?!

First off, stress can be caused greatly by cars. Although, this may sound absurd, just put some thought into it. With a limit on car usage, you hardly have to worry about your kid crossing the street by themselves. Say bye bye, to car hijackers! They are no longer a problem, neither is getting in an accident.Â  Stop worrying, because do to the limit on car usage, your chances of caos are finited, they are no longer limitless.

Furthermore, air pollution is a big economic problem today. Limiting car usage means a great deal of air pollution reduction. In article, "" Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"", we see congestion was down 60 percent, after five days, five days alone! Can you imagine how much better our health would be? We see many cases of lung cancer, due to smoke in the lungs, putting a limit on many lives. Also, air pollution is as well bed for mother nature herself, killing trees, our vital resource we not only rely on to put a roof over our heads, but also our whole source of living. Air pollution, is a definite economic problem that we can get rid of simply with the reduction of car usage.

Is your money being well spent? Not really, and you can thank the monster sitting in your driving, hiding in plain site. Cars need lots of attention. We're talking about more attention than an infant! You have to provide it with insurance, monthly bills and so much more. For instance, if you were to get a flat tire, you have to replace it with a spare, tand then that flat has to also get fixed. Money, money, and more money just being stolen right from under your nose, while gas prises are piling higher!

To conclude, if you were to limit your car usage you shall find many advantages, not onlyÂ  for you but for the economy. Stress, is a never ending cycle with the hunk of parts you may call your, ""friend"". A reduction in air pollution has a great amount of benefits. Next time, you decide to take a ride out with your buddies in your car, take a nice good thought about all the exhaust possibly filling up your lungs, and if not yours then someone else's. Lastly, you no longer will have to worry about your money jumping out your pocket.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

Subject: Support for the Electoral College or Transition to Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my views regarding the Electoral College and whether it should be retained or changed to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. As an informed citizen and constituent, I have carefully considered the information from various sources, including the texts provided, and I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for several reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College system ensures certainty of outcome. In the current system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the chances of disputes over the election outcome, as demonstrated by the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and his opponent. Furthermore, with almost all states using a winner-take-all system, even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Another crucial advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes a president who has trans-regional appeal. No single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, forcing candidates to appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions. This system ensures that the president represents the interests of various regions and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected. It also engenders the sentiment that the president is everyone's president, fostering a sense of national unity.

Moreover, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, candidates focus their efforts on these states, which can translate into increased voter engagement and thoughtful decision-making. Swing states, therefore, play a crucial role in determining the election outcome, as voters in these states receive the most attention and information from the candidates.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the weight of political influence between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as prescribed in the Constitution, disadvantages large states in terms of their representation. However, the Electoral College partially rectifies this discrepancy by rewarding larger states with more attention from presidential candidates. This way, candidates are encouraged to address the concerns and issues facing both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College system provides an effective means of avoiding run-off elections. It ensures that a clear winner is always declared, preventing the need for additional elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This feature streamlines the presidential election process and reduces complexity and potential complications.

While advocates for a direct popular vote argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic, the information provided in the texts demonstrates that the system has practical benefits and aligns with key democratic principles. The Electoral College ensures certainty, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages meaningful voter participation, balances political influence, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, I strongly support maintaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. It serves as a vital mechanism for ensuring fair and representative elections. I kindly request that you consider these perspectives when determining your position on this matter. Thank you for your time and attention to this important issue.

Sincerely,

8B4BBB3F601D,"Dear State Senator,

I truly have no opinion on the electoral college and whether or not to keep it, but as this topic insists I must write my own opinion to you and here is what I think. Even with this article sort of informing me on this topic I still seem to have a misunderstanding (or no understanding) of what the Electoral College really is or what it does. Perhaps this is because of the lack of information I'm given about our government, or perhaps its because what the electoral college does is quite irrelevant to me and my fellow peers.

From what I have gathered though, the electoral college is a group of people that citizens vote for and these people are then allowed to elect a president? I am sure there is a lot more to it but from that statement which is proven true by the article, I think the electoral college is dumb. Instead of electing biased people to choose a biased president, why can't we just let the citizens elect a president; someone who appeals to us and not a large group of people that get hated on all the time. By having the electoral college it's like the government is lying to us.""Oh hey, we believe our citizens are the REAL people in charge of this country, but we aren't going to ever take off their training wheels."" Our government hasn't actually said that. but it's the kind of vibe majority of Americans get.

However, there are probably plus sides to the Electoral college as well. Most people when they don't end up with the results that they weren't hoping for, will question and occuse the oppoing side. As a result of this, elections run by popular vote would always turn into a huge drama infused battle, with the losing side accusing the winning side. This could result in uneccessary recounts; delaying us of a president for even longer than it should.

As I said in the beginning though, I really have no opinion on this matter nor do I truly care. What I think is we should keep things fair for our citizens but also plan ahead and think of the possible negative outcomes that could come from whatever we end up doing. So, should we keep the Electoral College? Well that's a matter that I feel should be discussed by other people.

a995d0ca,"With the increasing concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage has become a topic of discussion in many communities around the world. There are several advantages to implementing measures that restrict car usage, such as reducing pollution, improving public health, and creating more accessible and inclusive communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study mentioned in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve public health. The high levels of pollution emitted by cars contribute to respiratory problems and other health issues. In Paris, for example, a driving ban was enforced during a period of intense smog, leading to a 60 percent decrease in congestion and significantly improved air quality. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, we can create healthier and cleaner environments for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more accessible and inclusive communities. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited, 70 percent of families do not own cars. This has led to more pedestrian-friendly streets, increased social interaction, and a greater sense of community. By designing neighborhoods with an emphasis on walkability and accessibility to public transportation, we can reduce dependency on cars and foster a stronger sense of belonging among residents.

Moreover, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. In Bogota, Colombia, the car-free day initiative has attracted millions of participants and has had positive effects on the city's economy. By reducing traffic congestion and promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as buses and bicycles, cities can improve the flow of goods and services, support local businesses, and boost economic growth.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving public health, creating more accessible communities, and benefiting the economy. As more communities around the world adopt measures to decrease car dependency, we can work towards a more sustainable and livable future. By prioritizing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning strategies, we can build communities that are less reliant on cars and more inclusive for all residents.",1,radek_500,,7
darragh_claude_v7_15,"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There are a few key reasons for this:

Safety is the number one priority when it comes to operating motor vehicles. Using a cell phone, whether it's talking, texting or other applications, drastically increases distractions from the important task of focusing on the road and other vehicles. Numerous studies have shown that drivers who use cell phones are much more likely to be involved in an accident than drivers who do not use phones. This puts not only the driver at risk, but also all other people sharing the road, whether in other vehicles or as pedestrians. Even hands-free use of phones has been found to be distracting as a person's mind is occupied with their conversation rather than 100% focused on driving. 

Legally, many places have already enacted laws against using handheld phones due to the safety risks. However, research shows hands-free use provides little benefit over handheld in terms of reducing crashes. Distraction is distraction, no matter how the phone is held. If the goal is truly safety, a full ban on any cell phone use while driving, even hands-free, is most prudent. Law enforcement also finds it difficult to distinguish between legal hands-free and illegal handheld use during traffic stops. A total ban simplifies laws and makes them clearer and easier to enforce.

As technology advances, phones become more tempting to use with new apps and increased connectivity. It is simply asking too much of a person to divide their attention between an engaging phone and the complex, potentially dangerous task of controlling a fast-moving vehicle. While phones are convenient and many feel they ""need"" to be constantly connected, safety should come before any non-essential phone use while driving. Lives are at stake with every vehicle on the road. For the well-being of all, the most sensible policy is a complete ban on cell phone use when driving.",1,darragh_claude_v7,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

According to statistics from ""The National Safety Council"", cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. I feel like if more people were less distracted by their phones then there would be fewer car accidents than there are today. One out every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

Second of all, though you may be only replying to a quick text or answering a quick call, but those few seconds you took to look at your phone traffic is still going. I agree that phones should not be in use while operating a vehicle because not only does the phone user get dangerously injured, it could cause someone else get hurt, too. I would advise anyone to not get caught driving while using their device now today because there are consequences.

A cell phone should not be used while operating a vehicle because driving should be number one priority.

Third of all, although I feel as if phones shouldn't be prohibited while operating a car but there are some reasons it would be reasonable to use your phone while driving. I think the only reason you should use your phone is too answer important calls only nothing more. The only way you could answer those important calls are if you have Bluetooth and your phone is connected. I feel that if you have to remove your hand from the steering wheel to use your phone you shouldn't. I say phones should shouldn't be used at all inside of a vehicle that on.

Most of all, drivers shouldn't use their phone while driving because it's very life threatening and dangerous. Driving while texting doesn't only just put your life in harm it puts others that are around. Texting and driving is a big distraction; focus should always be number priority while driving. Most accidents that occur today are from distracted drivers who were on their phone .Even though they were on phones for short amount of time, within that time span a car accident can occur.

C07E3C23CE7B,"I think we should keep the electoral college be cause people can vote on electors andÂ  not the actual presedent they want to win for the vote because people think he or she may or may not be the best person to be for that job we should keep the electoral college for reasons like not haveing to pick or choose for theÂ  better person. To be if the both want kinda the same thing,it would help the people not the presedent it only gets them votes and votes are nouthing to me or others.

2. second i think we should keep it beacuse you can tell who voted and not the people that voted because you get a sticker that said i voted so that puts an place that you have voted or not and if u dont u have some time to do it or there will be anourther person who takes and votes in ur place and u wont be able to vote .3. because the ballet things are full and the time is up for them to vote ,so they have to wait till the next time to vote is ansd that will be the next year so useing the electoral collageÂ  will allow u to be able to vote on time and mnot miss be ing able to vote becaus evoting is im portant to the county or the contonet to be counted on not only you but others around so u can have a choice of what you want to have as a presedent of the united states 4. third haveingf the electoral college will help tho ones who cant get out to vote and be able to do it just about any wear your at and that will be help full to me and othere because im nort allowed to vote yet so it comes in handy in many ways to us and other people to ther united states .

I wonder why we don't get to use phones in schools i got to reasons why we should use them my two reasons are?

my first reason is that just like working adults students need a break from sitting in a boring class all day working and studying and taking quiz's to alot of students in the united states cell phones is are way of communicating with people and each other we should be able to talk on are cell phones at lunch to kind of take away the stress we have in the classrooms.

my second reason i think we should have cell phones is because it keeps occupied so you don't fall into any trouble it is the backbone to a teens society it also helps teens with there communicating skills and helps us talk better. and that's why i think we should have phones during are free time lunch periods,breaks,library. etc.

well i told you my two reasons why i think students should be allowed to have phones at school and on school facilities.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
D6D4A77F4AAA,"Presidential election is held every after four years on the first Monday of the month November. We decide who's going to be our next leader, the President. Electoral College is kind of unfair for some people because they think that whoever got the most popular vote should be President. But to think, what if the people we vote to is not right to be the next President and she/he got that most popular vote? Wouldn't that be a disaster? I say we should keep the Electoral College.

Electoral College process in consists of the electors that have been selected by the people. The ones who got selected are the ones with great intelligence and with great sense of leadership. In the first passage it mentioned that ""The Electoral College has a total of 538 electoras and the majority of electoral votes are required to have 270 electoral votes."" This means that for you to be one of the candidates you atleast have to have 270 electoral votes and this is a good way of picking our candidates to run for us for President.

Remember the election between Obama and Romney? It was close but, not that close. Our President, Obama got 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and Romeny. Almost of every states electoral votes is on a ""winner-take-all"" basis. For every slight of pulrality in each of the states, it creates a ""landslide electoral-vote"". This means that a tie would be possible because the number 538 votes is uneven but, it's mostly not to happen and this is because of Electoral College.

Electoral College avoids the problem of which didn't receive a majority of the votes. In passage three it gave an example about how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent only in pluraity of the popular votes and the winning number of the Electoral College is 301 and 370 electoral votes. Because of Electoral College the pressure that happens in electing the next President to lead us for four years is reduced and it also tells us which is the winner of the election.

If we elect our President using popular votes it migh be a disaster. Because not all of the candidates are that great of leading the whole country and If he/she got selected to be our next leader for the next four years our country would be in a huge chaos. I slightly agree with electing that person and making him/her the next President because they got the most popular votes but, then again I don't think it's the right way of picking our new leader.

0CA2DD836BBA,"Cars have been around for ages now, people are constantly making new modles to make them better. But what were to happen if we took them away and we only relied on walking or riding bikes. There are three reasons why I blieve this would be a benefit for everyone. Picture it, a world without cars.

People believe cars to be a necessity, so they will be able to get from place to place but there are advantages to limiting the usage of cars in certain areas. For one it would reduce the amount of greenhouse gas, source 1 tells about a suburban town where there are no cars. It states that only 12 perecent of greenhouse gas emits in europe while in america it is up to 50 perecent. While Paris bans driving because of all the smog, statistics from source 2 show that Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter.

Following that, limiting the usage of cars can lower stress levels. In Bogota, Colombia they begin their 'Day without cars' for the thirs year straight. The citizens of Bogota were very coopertive of this. The mayor tells how even ""The rain hasn't stopped peole from participating"". Source 3 informs how even businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza rode a two seater bicycle with his wife and how he believes ""It's a good way to reduce stress and lower air polution."", as they countinue their newly found tradition other cities in colombia such as Cali and Valledupar join in on the event. Looks like Colombias program is starting to spread for the better.

Finally, bringing it back home to America on the advantages on limiting car usage. President Obama shares his plan to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. Sources from article 4 tell how Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and how fewer are getting their license as the years go by, statistics show a large drop in the amount of 16 to 39 year olds getting their license. this article also tells how sociologists believe that if this countiues it will be beneficial for the enviornment. New York being one of the most populated states has a new bike-sharing program as well as car-sharing programs to help contribute to lessen the pollution and emission of greenhouse gases.

In Conclusion, while cars have been and are a great asset limiting the use of them could greatly benefit every one by using lessening stress levels, lowering pollution, and reduce the amount of greenhouse gas. Looks like we're already headed in the right direction.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
EFBD506FC8F2,"Select me to visit your company It would be a great opportunity to learn more about this job, but also is going to help me to have better skills in what I do. I could easily write about my six years of experience in this area, and you would see that I could ""qualify"" for this visit, but I don't want you to select for those reasons; working in a TV Production company has always been my dream since I was a kid.

I was a little girl with a lot of energy, goals and really confident about myself, I enjoyed being in presentations, ceremonies or anything about being in front of the public. I kept growing, and a lot of people thought that I was going to forget about all this crazy dream to be in TV, but it wasn't like that, my interest was increasing more and more; I was still in my country, Generic_City, when I went for my first time to a news channel, the principal of my school in that moment selected me to make a commercial about a festival that we had, I'm not going to lie, I was scared and really nervous, but once I touched the microphone, I forgot all my fears, the employees of that place were so surprised, they told my teacher, ""how a 13 years old little girl can have a lot of talent? The way that she speaks make It see it so natural and easy to do it""

I would never forget those words, because It was there, when I realized, that all this was for me, ever since that one day, my principal asked me to do all the commercials for the school.

Two years later I had to move to a different school, and I had a big surprise, this school had way more opportunities to be successful in this area; the owner of the school saw my potential in the way I speak, and yes, he asked me to do every ceremony and commercials during the whole school year. But that was not enough for me, I wanted to learn more, so I stared to used professional cameras and make homemade videos to practice a little big more; that same year my family decided to move to the United States. I was really sad, no only for my family and friends, also, I didn't know If coming to America would change my dream,

everything was different, traditions, school and most important, the language. This change was not going to change what I like to do, I stared taking this class called: ""TV and Media Production"" and I felt like coming back to home, everything that I love to do, was right there, I learned how to editing videos, how to record professionally and take all I know, to a whole different level; couples moths in this country and I already had the opportunity to being in different news channels,video for the school and they loved how I did it, and I don't have to think a lot to know that this is what I want to as a career.

These are just some of the reasons why you should select me to visit and learn more about your company, I know you may have more applications of students with better grades and experience than me, but no all of them have the passion and enthusiast that I have, because this wouldn't be just a job, I would be a the biggest accomplishment for me.",0,original_moth,"Task: Write an essay discussing why you should be selected to visit the company and learn more about the job, in light of your six years of experience and past successes in TV production.

866B61E17B7D,"Distance learning has been growing in popularity recently, and many people are arguing that it should be used instead of traditional schooling. However, I believe that distance learning would be detrimental to students because it takes away the physical connections between students, teachers, and peers, it allows students to slack off on their work, and online learning is not a reliable way to teach students.

When students do their learning online they are looking at a teacher, or their work through a screen which completely takes away the physical connection between the student and their teacher. This physical connection is important because it allows students to build relationships with their teachers, and the teachers can understand the student at a deep level. Students would also not be able to ask questions or receive help as easy as in a traditional school because in school all they have to do is raise their hand, but online they have to go through a much tougher process to get assistance. Distance learning would also hinder a students' ability to work with their peers on projects because they lose the benefit of communicating in person, and building a strong relationship in order to work together as a strong group.

Giving students the ability to learn online from the comfort of their own home puts a lot of trust in these students to actually get work done, but many of these students will choose to misuse this trust and slack off on their work. For example, if a student had the ability to sleep in longer or play video games instead of doing their schoolwork, many students would put schoolwork at a lower priority than these choices. This gives students the power to just not do their work and lose a lot of their motivation to continue working. Another question that needs to be asked of online learning is who would punish these students who slack off and choose to not do their work? If these irresponsible students did not care about getting their work done when they had to go to school, then why would they care about it when they can stay home and enjoy other things?

A strong defense for online learning is that it makes education more accessible to students who can't go to school for reasons such as not being able to afford it. Distance learning is also very simple because all you need is a device that can access the internet and the internet itself. Although distance learning does have these benefits of being simple and accessible, online learning is vulnerable and can not be trusted to reliably give students an education. There are many reasons why online learning is not reliable: the online learning platform can be hacked, a student's internet could not work properly, or the system could be too slow to handle many students being on it. These are big issues that are not uncommon and if they happened to someone who solely used online learning as their way of getting an education, then they would have no way to continue learning.

Getting rid of the physical connections, giving students too much trust that they will misuse, and online learning itself not being reliable are all reasons why I believe that students would not benefit from distance learning. Instead of switching to distance learning, we can instead try to reform traditional schools in order to give students a better place to learn and make learning more enjoyable for them.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
E1B9CAF68CA7,"Hilary Clinton, soccer players, people in the government everyone had failed once in their life time. Everyone is not complete. We are humans we make mistakes and we fail.

Failure without loss of enthusiasm is the best thing people can do. We gain experience by failing. We learn not to give up and chase our dreams. We learn how to be patient and deal with problems. We never know when is the best time to do something or to get something so be patient. my parent told me that""good things will come to you just be patient""

Although, after failing once most of the people lose hope and stop trying. Nevertheless, it is not easy to start over because it gets boring working on same thing over and over and people give up on their dreams.

To begin, failing help people to gain more experience. When we do same thing over again it makes our work easier. For example when we fail the test at school and we have to retake it we already know what mistake we did for the test so we do not repeat it. This shows that we will try harder when we get the chance to do it again. Clearly we will be successful next time.

Furthermore, we learn not to give up when we fail for the first time. Giving up is not the best thing to do after failing. For instance, we can make a whole new plan and ways to do our work. This shows that we are going to be successful next time. For example, when I was 13 I had to take a test in order to get in to the high school that I wanted but, the test was hard and I failed the test i said I will not take it again because it is hard and I can't do it but my sister said that i can't give up and I have to take it again and again and finally I pass the test for the second time.

Moreover, it teaches us to be patient. when we fail it is the best thing for us to wait for the good time to start over and to get what we want. obviously, it will take time to start all over and do everything one by one but it will help us to learn how to be patient and to deal with problems better than before. Clearly we will get what we want sooner or later after trying hard.

Overall, failure is a key to success. We will not get to success if we do not fail once. It is not something to be ashamed of.

8793444EF088,"Millions of people attend school everyday all around the World. Many of these people attend classes at public schools rather than taking classes online because people feel as though classes at public school are a better option and are more beneficial. However, online classes provide the same learning curriculum and information as public schools do. The only major difference between the two class options are that online cclasses allow people to take classes from home. Taking classes from home allows for students to experience the benefits of working in a more comfortable setting, increases their ability to focus, and teaches the importance of responsibility.

In order for students to work productively they need to be within a comfortable environment. Online classes allows for students to experience this. For Example, Generic_Name took Biology online from home for his 1st semester and he always turned in his work on time and always finished his work within 30 minutes to an hour, but Generic_Name's shy friend Generic_Name who didn't take the class online and went to school hardly turned in his work on time and was always slacking off. Generic_Name being able to independently work from home in a comfortable setting allowed him to work in a efficient manor. When students are uncomfortable in the environment they can't work productively because they don't feel comfortable. Without being comfortable in situations students constantly get sidetracked and can't get work done because they may feel as though they are being judged or face issues of uncertainty. Another example is Generic_Name took Algebra 2 online from home her Sophomore year in High School and always knew what she was doing and how to solve the mathematical equations properly, however her boyfriend Generic_Name who took the class at school struggled with finishing his work and keeping a good grade in the class. Generic_Name having the ability to do her work in her bed and being comfortable while she did her work allowed for her to complete her work. Without comfort students struggle to process certain criteria because they aren't relaxed and can't comprehend material that is given to them because they will focus on the fat that they are uncomfortable. Students must feel as though they are in a calming environment in order to work efficiently.

Students are only able to truly focus when they aren't distracted by others. Online classes decrease the vast amount of distractions that public schooling classes have. For Instance, Generic_Name has a project in her AP Environmental Science class online that is due in 3 weeks so as soon as she gets the assignment she starts to work on the project, on the other hand Generic_Name's friend Generic_Name who takes the same class in school and received the same project didn't even think to look at the paper because she decided to talk to people in her class instead. Generic_Name doesn't experience the distractions that Generic_Name does because Generic_Name takes the class by herself and doesn't have to deal with multiple people left and right. When students are away from constant distractions they have the ability to truly focus on the task at hand. Another instance is Generic_Name has to read 20 pages everyday for his AP Literature class and always succeeds to do so, yet his friend Generic_Name who takes the book at school and has time to read in class consistently fails to read the assigned work because he is always staring at a girl in his class. With Generic_Name taking the class from home and not having to deal with being distracted by a girl he thinks is pretty all the time allows for him to stay on task and pay attention. Students can easily experience concentration issues when they are surrounded by multiple people rather than just being by themselves because the mind tends to wonder when in a environment of multiple people. In order for students to remain on task they can't be within an environment that distracts them.

When doing a task on one's own terms they learn how to be responsible. Online classes teach students that it is their personal responsibility to complete tasks given to them. One example is Generic_Name had was taking Spanish online from home and his teacher doesn't send out emails of when the assignments need to be completed, but his girlfriend Generic_Name who takes his class at school always gets reminders during class when the assignments are due. Generic_Name has to consistently check for work himself rather than always relying on his teacher to tell him. Generic_Name's online teacher doing this will allow students to learn that they are responsible for knowing what and when assignments are due. Another example is Generic_Name was doing work online from home and was notified once online that in one week before that his exam was coming up and had to study for the test, yet his friend Generic_Name who attended school and took the same class and had the same teacher was informed 3 times during the week before the exam that he had to study before the exam. Without daily meetings with teachers the students have to take the initiative to follow the instructions they are given. If the instructions aren't followed it is on the student that they had not been active online and payed attention when the information was provided.

Overall online classes can be very helpful to students and their learning processes. Online classes allow for students to feel comfortable while learning, pay more attention to information, and realize that they must keep up with assignments given. Students have the ability to feel more comfortable and complete their work when they take classes at home rather than taking classes in school. Online classes can also help decrease the number of issues that may take attention away from the given tasks. These classes also allow for students to learn that they have the duty to keep themselves informed and that they can't rely on others for work. Ultimately online classes are an excellent option for students to take and students should consider the multiple benefits that come with taking classes from home.Â ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
B3991E1D4202,"My Thoughts on the Story ""Making Mona Lisa Smile.""

Lets be real first before we get started on the real thing. Who came up with all these weird names for facial expressions and facial muscles, my goodness I thought I was surely going to get taken out of class from laughing so hard at these weird names.

I think that using technology to read someone emotions is horrible stupid. I mean come on why invade someones privacy. Why trust a computer when it can mulfunction, and calculate wrong. Yet some might say its a good thing to invade others personal emotions by using technology to see what their feeling and figure out why their feeling that way. Not everyones facial tissue or muscles are the same nor can you predict what their facial expressions mean as of emotions. Using a 3-D computer model of someones facial structer you can see the muscles of the face in different forms and can tell what emotions are showing.

Example: Your orbivularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show your anger. So the people who agree with using this technology would rely on the 3-D facial model of someone and look for muscle tightening or high raises of the eyebrows, or tightening of the jaw.

People who do not agree on this would say you can not always believe what technology says. Maybe someones facial expressions are natural. For instence someone who was born with difunctional issues; a lip attacthed to their nose, if someone were to use a picture of someone with a lip disorder and the persons lips are tight they assume it is cause they are mad. When in reality they might just be sad because their lip is stuck like that, and your assuming it's tight cause their mad.

Paragraph 5 talks about humans calculating everyday. well for one when the author says, ' You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" What makes you think it's a she it could be a he or a she. Don't assume genders author. Simply some people have trouble showing the right emotions too. For instance you could be happy and have a frown on your face and if someone were to send it the the facial computer and ask what is she/his emotions right now. Well the computer would say they are confused, when really they are happy and just had their face rested in a frown.

In paragraph 6 it says that, "" most human communcication is nonverbal, including emotional comunication. So computers need to understand that, too."" Dr. Huang notes said.

So why do computers need to understand how we feel? If we want someone to know how we feel, we will let them know. What's the point in wasting time working on a computer to figure out how someone feels when you could simply ask and not waste money and time on a computer that could malfunction? The author say's that the Mona Lisa demonstration is intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows you just how much the computer can do. Well it surely didn't bring a smile to my face.

Instead it made me think of lot's of questions on stuff like; what happens if your so called computer malfunctions? Where will everything go? Surely you have everything saved? Have you tested it on many people more than 20? Were those people all the same? Or were they different? Do you know what people will think of it, or how they will react to all this new technology? Why did you use technology? What happens when we go into a blackout and you can't rely on any of the technology? People will want answers and then turn on you cause you relyed on something that can't function without electricity.

Paragraph 7 explains some ""encoding"" emotions and what to do while looking in the mirror then the author says that those instructions are for a face that looks happy. Now if your smart and I shall hope you are, we both know if you go to a mirror and force your eyes to squint and force your lips to move upwards, and then raise your cheeks up. Lets just say that will not look like a happy face, it will look like someone who doesn't know how to smile and is trying ot force a fake smile that looks horrible wrong.

Paragraph 8 talks about how a muscle clue can tell when a politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. Well what if someone asks them a personal question and they don't want the whole world to know? And you go and use that computer on their 3-D face you made and tell the world they were lying to that question. Hm well you just ruined that for them and exposed them. Now I know what your thinking they wouldn't do that, and maybe your right or wrong. Their is always someone who can hack or get the full version of this what do you call it FACS, and that person would probably spill it to the world and thank you for creating that machine. Then you're sucked into the law suits and drama and people who would sew you for ruining the world or someones life.

In paragraph 9 the author says, "" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" Does it really? I mean you can't force a smile, and we all know faking a smile does not make you happy. These facts are from someone who probably just used a couple peoples facial expressions to get to publish his or her's book so why not ask more than a couple peoples opinions and what they say about all this.

I understand why you would want to read a studens emotional expressions during class to see how they feel and what you could do to make it better, but what if it doesn't get better and you try everything you can and their still sitting in calss bored and tired and not giving a rat? Then your stuck with a machine you don't need anymore and less money than you had because you wanted to spend it on a machine then asking the student's what they thought could help them.

Most people would spend money on machines to try to help kids because thats all their used to doing spending money on kids to make them happy, when in reality you just need to have them suck it up and pay attention reward them with things that don't cost a lot or something that doesn't cost anything.

This is my opinion and my thoughts.                                        ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
8E555DA6ED4D,"I think they would not benefit from this, because its a lot of money, people might learn better in person, also it would be better for people to interact with one another and that wont workout if they are taking online classes. Here are my explanations why!

People might not have the money to do online classes because they are so expensive. They might not get payed enough or might not work enough, or might not even have a job. The expenses could range up to over hundreds of dollars not even with the equipment. They could possibly hardly be making it by. They also could have bills and taxes to pay when it comes.

Students might learn better in person because of how they were taught or what they know. It might be hard for people to learn throughÂ a screen, they might have to be a hands on person in orderÂ to learn. They also might have a learning disability,so that might make it hard for them to learn also. Everybody learns in different ways such as such as some might be quicker than others and some might be slower than others. Also if you were taught from home it could be hard for you to pay attention and keep focus.

Students also need interaction with others. If they are cooped up in their house all day that will lead them to signs of depression. So maintain their interaction with others would be very recommended because its not healthy not to talk to some some. Talking is a very healthy way of expressing yourself or making friends. If you do online classes then there is a less chance of you making friends and interacting with others.

In conclusionÂ I think being taught at home or online classes is a bad idea because of all the possibilities such as,its a lots of money people might not have, people learn in different ways, and people need interaction in their everyday to day life.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the debate of the exploration of Venus is exposed for discussion. The article brings up many contriversal topics discussing whether or not Venus is worth exploring. Though most of the article talks about the dangers and overall negativities Venus has to offer when it comes of exploring it, the author takes this information and turns it into postives. The author demonstrates that although Venus is dangerous and almost impossible to explore, attempting to do just that willl be well worth it in the long run. Due to this, the readers can say that the author supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well.

In the article, the author first brings up the fact that Venus has a very toxic and dangerous atmosphere. They go on to say that because of this, the conditions in Venus are far to extreme for any human to survive in. Then, the author even posses the question of: Why are scientists trying to explore Venus more if it's so inhospitable? The author uses this question to transition into how they support the exploration of Venus, by saying how despite the inhospitable environment, Venus has many Earth-like qualities which intrigues many astronomers. In the article the author states, ""... Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This shows that learning more about Venus could potentially be a great advantage to Earth since it's the most similar planet to Earth in the entire solar system.

A second problem the author states about exploring Venus is that every attempt to explore the planet has failed. One reason being is how the extreme heat has prevented each spacecraft to survive for more than a couple of hours on Venus's surface. In the article the author states, ""... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" The author contradicts this later in the article by explaining the technological advacements that NASA has accomplished to help prevent having another failed mission to Venus. The author states, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This demonstrates how even though Venus is about impossible to explore, technology can help create smarter alternatives for exploring the planet's surface.

Throughout the article, the author demonstrates that the postives of exploring Venus outweigh the negatives by giving strong evidence as to why the positives eliminate the problems when it comes to exploring Venus's surface. Although there are many major issues with exploring Venus, the author shows the readers that there are solutions that can help fix these problems. Not only does the author do this, but they show how Earth can discover and learn many valuable things about Venus that can help in the long run. So through very strong evidence about the positve that was able to outweigh the negative, the author was able to support the idea of studying Venus very well.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Cell phone use while driving is one of those hot-button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cell phone. When notifications sound, kids my age and many adults have now been conditioned to immediately engage. Our engrained Pavlov's dog reaction doesn't stop just because we are at the wheel.. Whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity gets the better of them and they feel they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It doesn't matter how good you are at multitasking. It should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are a few reasons for that.

Let's start with texts, social media, and any other alert. To stop and read this alert you would have to take your eyes off the road for longer than the recommended time of one second, it takes to check the rear-view mirror. It is extremely dangerous to text or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your life you are risking. We endanger every one of our passengers and anybody we are sharing the road with.

As for making phone calls, this to should be banned. I do understand that sometimes your spouse may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home, or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case just pull over to the side of the road, take the call, then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason for you to pick up your phone while you're driving.

Whatever it is can almost certainly wait until you get where you're going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many lives to tweets or texts if people are under the threat of losing their license, steep fines, or if they truly think about the potential consequences. I don't think I've ever liked one post or seen one funny meme that could replace the loss of a friend or loved one.         ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
darragh_claude_v7_134,"Drivers should not use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There are a few key reasons why cell phone use behind the wheel is dangerous and should be avoided. 

Firstly, cell phone use is a major distraction for drivers. Talking, texting, or otherwise interacting with a phone requires the driver's visual attention to be directed away from the road. This increases the likelihood of the driver not noticing potential hazards like other vehicles or pedestrians. Studies have shown that driving while distracted is as dangerous as driving drunk. The brain needs to focus entirely on the complex task of navigating traffic safely. Even hands-free phone conversations siphon away too much mental bandwidth to stay fully aware of one's surroundings.

Secondly, cell phone use increases reaction time in emergency situations. When a prompt response is needed to avoid an accident, a driver on their phone simply cannot react as quickly as one with their full attention on driving. Braking distances and the ability to maneuver are diminished. The extra seconds it takes to process road conditions while distracted can mean the difference between a near miss and a collision. Reaction time is a critical factor in avoiding accidents. 

Finally, the act of holding and manipulating a phone physically takes a driver's hands off the wheel. This further impairs control of the vehicle and ability to respond to any rapid change. Driving requires having both hands on the wheel to steer as needed. Taking a hand off to hold a phone leaves much less control available in split second situations. 

In summary, cell phone use, even hands-free, introduces too much risk and potential for distraction while driving. The complexity and responsibilities of operating a multi-ton vehicle on public roads require full attention from drivers at all times. For safety reasons, cell phone activities should be avoided entirely until the vehicle is safely parked. Lives could depend on drivers remaining focused only on the road.",1,darragh_claude_v7,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

Texting and driving is a major issue today. Although most people own and operate cell phones daily, there is a time and a place that they should be used, and while driving or operating another vehicle isn't one of them. People should not be able to text and drive because it causes accidents, it is a distraction, and it can seriously injure or even kill you or someone else.

Texting and driving can cause accidents. Many people think they can multitask, which leads them to believe that they can text and drive. This is incredibly dangerous especially since it has been scientifically proven that it is impossible to multitask. ""Trying more than one thing at a time - especially anything potentially dangerous, like texting while driving - seriously compromises our ability to complete the tasks safely and well.
