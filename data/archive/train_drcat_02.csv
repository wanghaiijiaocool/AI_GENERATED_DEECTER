Working or doing things individually can have a lot of benefits. When people work or do things by themselves, they can develop important skills that help them succeed in life. For example, when people work alone, they can learn how to be responsible and reliable. They can also learn how to problem solve and think critically. These skills are important because they can help people achieve their goals and be successful in their careers.

When people work or do things individually, they can also develop their own unique style and approach. This can help them stand out and be more creative. For example, a musician who practices alone can develop their own unique sound and style. A writer who works alone can develop their own unique voice and style. This can help them be more successful and creative in their field.

Being yourself is also important for success. When people are themselves, they can be more authentic and genuine. This can help them connect with others and build stronger relationships. For example, a person who is themselves can be more confident and comfortable in their own skin. This can help them make friends and find a supportive community.

Planning and achieving goals is also important for success. When people set goals and work towards them, they can develop a sense of purpose and direction. This can help them stay motivated and focused. For example, a person who sets a goal to run a marathon can train and prepare themselves to achieve that goal. This can help them feel a sense of accomplishment and pride.

Working or doing things individually can be different from working or doing things with a partner. When people work with a partner, they can learn how to collaborate and work together. This can help them develop teamwork and communication skills. However, working or doing things individually can also help people develop their own unique skills and approach.

In conclusion, working or doing things individually can have a lot of benefits. It can help people develop important skills, be themselves, and achieve their goals. While working with a partner can also be beneficial, there are many advantages to working or doing things individually. By doing so, people can develop their own unique style and approach, be more authentic and genuine, and achieve their goals in their own way.",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

I just want to let you know my opinion about not letting student who have less than a C in their grades participate in any of the activities. I think that it is right that you do that rule in our school because if you do, it might help the students understand that it is really important that they have good grades.

This may help the students but not only them it might help the teachers to. I think this because it will help the teacher because they will have more interest in teaching us the students because they will know that we may attention and not that we just play around in class. It will help the students because they will know that if they try hard to bring their grades up they will be able to participate in the activities.

So, I really think this will help us so that we may attention more to our grades. I think that this is important because I personally think that my grades are important to me and to my family. I think that yes you should do this rule that if you don't have more than a C you don't get to participate in any of the school activities that we have.

116FB053BEC7,"I believe they should change the voting to popular votes. In my perspective voters are the most important in the elections. There opinion on the president should be able to count either way. Lots of voters feel left out like there opinion dont count. Sometimes the president elected by the electoral college is not the one every one wanted; he has diffrent points of view in what he want to do.

The president that the electoral college has elected is not always the one everyone expects to be. Lots of presidents have won by electoral college not by the voters. These presidents that are elected by the electoral college can possibly be the presidents to bring the United States to the ground.

The voters feel they know what is best for our country. They always elect the person that will bring America to the top. For example Barack Obama he is helping immagrants go back to school be able to get a job and be something in life, like maybe a mechanic,doctor, or even a federal officer. They chances that he has gave us lets people know that these are the type of presidents we need.

People feel left out because if the electoral college ar the people that are going to select the president what is the point in voting. Lots of them feel that electoral college is more important than what we the people think. The electoral college doesn't let people feel that the person hat they have selected is the president that will help out the United States Of Americam to become number one.

On the other hand people believe that the electoral college is good and we should keep having it. They believe this because because they think that they know what is best for us. Also that their vote is the best option than ours.

I believe that the president should be able to win by popular vote because we the people shall select the best president. The president that will once again put the U.S back on top. The president that wins should win by popular vote not by the electoral college.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

Jobs was famously fired from Apple, the company he founded, in 1985. In 1996 he returned to Apple with a renewed sense of ambition and drive, and made the decisions which turned the company around and made it the international success it is today. Jobs himself stated that being fired from his own company forced him to push himself and think differently than before, stating ""Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me... The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.

D90A159EDD27,"Dear Mr. Principal,

I believe that students should be required to do community service. It makes students better people to be around, increases productivity, and the work needs to be done. Think of the last time you saw adults doing community service. this is mostly because adults didn't learn to do it as students, and now they don't feel like taking time to do it now. Students should be required to complete community service.

People who do community service tend to be more content with what they have because they see what it's not to have a lot of things as well. When you go on a missions trip, you sometimes see disaster victims firsthand. As you see more people who don't have what you have, you tend to become more thankful for what you do have, instead of wishful for what you don't. Plus, since you don't get paid for community service, it helps you to appreciate volunteers more. Most students could benefit from community service in this way.

Students who do community service would become more productive. When you try to jam in something else into someone else's schedule, they make time to do it. Students would be able to complete tasks more quickly, maximizing class time. Teachers would get more done in class, and students would have less homework. Students could benefit from community service in this way.

Community service needs to be done by someone. Most people look down on people who do community service because they ""Don't have anything better to do"". They usually just put aside what they have to do. Plus, people who skip out sometimes say ""I'm too busy to do community service."" Well, if we learned as students to take time out of our day to do it, maybe as adults we would be more willing to do it as well.

Students should need to do community service. It makes students more pleasant, increases productivity, and someone has to do it. Maybe if we taught students to do it now, they would continue when they got older. Think of the problems we could solve if everyone just volunteered. That's why students should be required to do community service.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

You think its really neat and all but it doesnt go through your head that a strange living person made it.

falcon_180b_v1_658,"""As a high school student, I have witnessed the growing influence of social media on our daily lives. While platforms like Facebook and Twitter offer many benefits, such as staying connected with friends and family, they also raise concerns about privacy. As more personal information is being shared online, it's crucial to consider whether stronger privacy protections are needed on social media.

On one hand, proponents of stronger privacy protections argue that users should have greater control over their personal data. They believe that companies should be more transparent about how they collect, use, and share user information. Additionally, they advocate for stricter regulations to prevent misuse of personal data by third-party companies or advertisers. These measures could help protect users from potential identity theft, cyberbullying, and other online risks.

However, opponents argue that individuals already have the ability to control their privacy settings and decide what information they want to share. They claim that adding more regulations would stifle innovation and limit the benefits of social media. Moreover, enforcing stricter rules may prove challenging given the global nature of these platforms and differences in privacy laws across countries.

In my opinion, while users do have some control over their privacy settings, the current system can be confusing and difficult to navigate. Many people may not realize the extent to which their data is being collected and shared. Furthermore, the potential consequences of having one's personal information fall into the wrong hands can be severe. Therefore, I believe stronger privacy protections are necessary.

These protections could include clearer explanations of how user data will be used, easier access to privacy settings, and more robust security measures to prevent hacks and data breaches. Additionally, there should be consistent international standards for protecting user privacy, regardless of where the user or the platform is located.

In conclusion, as social media continues to play an increasingly prominent role in our lives, it's essential to ensure that users' privacy rights are respected and protected. While there may be arguments against stronger privacy protections, I believe the potential risks outweigh any potential downsides. By implementing clearer guidelines and better security measures, we can help create a safer and more secure online environment for everyone.""",1,falcon_180b_v1,"With the rise of social media, there has been an increase in the amount of personal information shared online.

5219253594A2,"Dear Principle,

I sincerely hope you will not have to take such severe actions as to ban cell phones from school no matter what because that truly would not be a good idea. I think you should allow students to bring their phones and permit them to use their phones during free periods and lunch periods as long as they aren't disturbing people in class, which won't happen because you will make students turn their phones off during class and/or take them from them during class and give the phones back after class. This would cause the students to pay attention no matter what, even though the students already do pay attention.

Taking away all phone privileges would be wrong a dangerous very, very dangerous. What would happen if an armed person came into the school and the school's telephone lines were cut? There would be no way to contact the police or anybody to help with the situation. I say this because if students aren't allowed to have phones teacher's shouldn't be able to have phones at school either. That would be unequal rights, a form of segregation, so to speak. Students are not suppose to use phones during school at all and students very rarely break that rule. However, all the time students see their teachers using their phones. That is a bad example because that sends the message to the students that its okay to break the rule and use your phone during school. If you ban phones from students you have to band phones from teachers as well. That brings me back to the beginning of this paragraph. With no phones allowed to students or teachers there would be no way to contact help. That is a very serious problem and that should be more of a concern than whether students can have phones in school or not if they don't use them during class.

Suppose a teacher sees a student with a phone out in class, will happen? The teacher should take the phone away and not give it back until the end of class. No big deal. However you are saying that the teachers don't catch the students using their cell phones during class, well then they should make sure at the beginning of class that there phones are off and that they keep them on their desk so the teacher can see if they are using them or not. Or the teacher could just take everyone's phone at the beginning of class and not have to worry about it. That is a plus because students don't need phones during class anyway. I'm saying that the students don't need phones in class not all together no phones. I am saying this because some students have games on their phones that they can play during open periods or at lunch. That isn't affecting anything or anyone because they have an open period so there is no teacher to annoy by using their phone and they have a ton of time on their hands so they want to make there time fun. The video may have persuaded you the wrong way. Students dont really use there phone that much. Besides most of those examples were during free periods or free time that the student has. That would lead you to believe that the students should be able to use their phones during free time and that cell phones rarely affect the class and or class work.

In the video only one time does it show that a students phone is being used during class. The others are in the hallway, outside, or in a place where their phones won't disturb anyone around them. That is a big positive. Students don't try to annoy teachers they, it just happens that sometimes a random student gets bored and uses their phone but that only happens like once or twice.

In conclusion, I don't think you should ban phones that woul",0,persuade_corpus,,3
DBC53691CD0A,"Do you believe that your child should grow and learn with skills that are needed for everyday life? Attending school is very beneficial, and can prepare you for the working environment that you will have to face in the future. Some may say that online classes can be convenient for a student who has a busy work schedule because they can attend classes on their own time, and won't have to spend most of the hours that are in a day to go to the actual school. I believe that students would not benefit from attending online classes because they wouldn't build social interaction skills, they wouldn't know how to function in a work environment, and they wouldn't have the work motivation to complete their assignments.

An important reason that causes online classes to be unbeneficial¬†is the inability to create social interaction skills. When students attend school, they have to communicate with other students and teachers. Therefore, students learn how to correctly interact with others, and build good relationships. However if a student is taking classes online, they wouldn't be obligated to actually communicate with peers in person. Having the ability to talk to others is a very important skill for their working careers in the future. During a career you will be forced to interact with many people such as, co-workers, costumers, and clients. Therefore, attending school is a great way to obtain those skills by talking to other students and their teachers. Furthermore, It is also a great way to build friendships with kids their age. Having friends can change the overall experience to a childhood because it can lead to a life necessity called ""fun"". Life wouldn't be the same if I didn't have people that I could call my friend because learning can be more interesting if you're experiencing it with people you know and trust. Lastly when a student can build relationships with their teachers, not only does it give you an easier learning environment, but it also provides an adult that you can ask questions or talk to. I have good relationships with many of my teachers, therefore allowing me to have a great experience in school. I am able to go to them if I ever need something or if I'm confused about a certain topic. Relationships with teachers can also ""make or break"" your experiences in your classes. When you look up to your teacher, it's more likely for you to want to learn what they are teaching because you have respect for them. Overall, having social interaction skills is very important for a good learning experience, and for everyday life in the future.

Another life necessity that a student would not obtain by taking online classes is being able to function in a work environment. Many jobs and careers require you to work under a schedule. This being said, if you are used to working at your own pace and on your own time, you will not be prepared to be in the working environment. Unfortunately, this can lead to the loss of your job and other opportunities because you can be considered unreliable. Furthermore if a student is used to working in a quiet area in their home, they can be at risk of not knowing how to handle busy and loud work environments. This can restrain them from being able to complete any of their work, therefore making them insufficient. When a place of business gets extremely busy, a lot of stress can be put on the employees. Attending school allows a person to be introduced to those types of conditions at an early stage, therefore making you more prepared for them than students who take online classes. Online classes do not prepare you for the real world, which can lead to a rude awakening in the future.

Lastly, a lack of work motivation is another important reason to online classes being unbeneficial compared to going to a school. Students can find it hard to get the motivation to complete their assignments. With the flexibility of online classes, students can start getting the idea of pushing school work aside to focus on other things. Unfortunately this mentality can get extremely out of hand, for their grades can start to suffer and their work load can pile up. Many students experience this chain reaction, therefore causing a lot of stress that can lead them to giving up. Having the access to attending a school decreases the ability to start this chain reaction because facing a teacher due to you not completing your work can be intimidating. Furthermore, going to your classes in person also gives you more work motivation because most of time you don't have the option to sit around and do nothing. Your teachers encourage you to ""use your time wisely"" when you are given the opportunity to complete your assignments during class, therefore giving students the extra push to actually do their work. When students are able to work on their own schedule due to taking online classes, it opens the opportunity to be lazy and not complete school work. This leads to students drowning in work because of their lack of work motivation.

I think that students would not benefit from attending classes from home because they wouldn't learn the ability to interact with people, they wouldn't do well in a work environment, and they wouldn't have the motivation to complete their work. Students who take online classes are isolated, therefore they are at larger risk to having rough experiences in the future due to not being prepared for the real world. They will not have the skills needed for everyday life, which can lead them to failure. However, attending an actual school gives you these life skills, therefore giving you a better chance of being successful in the career of your choice. You are also given the opportunity to making friends who can last a lifetime, and building relationships with teachers who can guide you in the right direction to being successful in life as well.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
15D3501518B0,"Many people believe that students benefit from working at home rather than at school. Opinions may vary as there are many pros and cons for students when it comes to online school. Some schools may not have a choice due to the overcrowding of students. But, students should not consider taking classes online because it will not give students an opportunity to socialize among peers, it will not give students structure compared to what they would get in school, and students won't be able to get hands on help on struggling assignments.

Socializing among peers is very important, especially among teens. Friends are a big part of a students life as they provide a sort of happiness and gratification. An example of this is when a student decided that he wanted to take all of his classes online, thinking that it would make life a lot¬†easier. What he didn't realize is the fact that he wouldn't have anyone to talk to during the day. While all his friends are at school, having conversations, he was at home by himself. Due to this problem, he then decided that it was a mistake and went back to school the following year. Many studies have shown that socializing among peers is very beneficial for ones mental health. Having someone to talk to and be there for you is very beneficial. If a student is taking online school the only thing they are talking to or looking at is a screen. Hopefully, students take this into consideration when deciding either¬†to stay in school or stay at home and take online school.

Structure is a key part of the amount of success a student will have in their academics. Schools provide this with teachers and how they make sure that a student is working up to his/her potential. About a year ago, there was a student at Generic_School that was a certified delinquent. This student barely showed up to class and his grades clearly represented it. Consequently, a teacher took her time and effort to try and get him on the right path. In time, it worked and the student is a lot more successful because this teacher gave him the structure that he needed and something he wouldn't have gotten online. Let's face it, if a student takes classes online, he/she won't give the same amount of effort they would normally due to no one keeping them in check. Staying home the entire day would give a student the thought of ""hey, just do this later"". That's the type of mindset a student will have if they take online school. Success isn't just the amount of effort a student puts in, but also the structure built around them.

Lastly, the amount of help a student can receive in school rather than online school is enormous. Having a teacher be there to help at anytime is something a student won't be able to receive online. Online school does provide students with help but it isn't the same as having someone hands on. An example of this is online Econ and Finance compared to in class Econ and Finance. A student must take this class in order to graduate and some may consider it easy, others may not. It isn't a very easy class and many students need help understanding it. Comparing finals scores between a online student and a in class student showed that the in class student understood more due to the amount of help she received from the teacher. Another argument is that students are given an opportunity to stay after school to get help on struggling assignments, something a student can't get online. After school help has helped many students finally understand the work given and given them a chance to be successful. If a student is having trouble online, they would most likely Google it and that isn't as reliable as a teacher. The help a student can get in school is incomparable to anything else.

In conclusion, online school will not benefit a student. Maybe there are pros, such as getting more sleep or having a quiet environment, but the amount of pros that come from regular school is insurmountable. Students should not consider taking classes online because it will not give students an opportunity to socialize among peers, it will not give students structure compared to what they would get in school, and students won't be able to get hands on help on struggling assignments. Hopefully students think this decision through and make sure that he/she makes the right one.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,6

Us humans are the major problem in this situation, we don't see that we are taking what we have to an advantage. To our factories, cars, or even trash. The main one that is causing our greenhouse gases to rise is our Power plants, but following behind the power plants are vehicles. Cars have become a major impact in our lives, from hurting one another, to hurting the place we live on. Carfree cities are going to help make a big, helpful change in peoples lives.

In the city of Vauban, Germany 70 percent of the families do not own a car. Vauban is called a ""carfree"" place, cars aren't allowed on the streets of vauban. Many people sold their cars to live in vauban, all around vauban wants a healthy way of living. Vauban allows car ownership, but the cars are only to be parked in two places which are the garages. ""When I had a car i was always tense, I'm much happier this way,"" Heidrun Walter said. It is a much healthier and less stressful way of living, new ideas will always come in handy. The United States Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""Car Reduced"" communities. Hopefully they get someone to tag along with this promotion, and get supporters to enforce it.

Bogota, Colombia is going on their third straight year of a ""Car Free"" city. They are wanting to reduce smog, so buses and taxis are permitted. ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" Carlos Arturo claimed. There was a consequence to the ones who didn't follow the rules, which was a 25 fine that they had to pay each time. Eventually, Two other Cities in Colombia, Cali and Valledupar, latched on to the idea of a ""Car reduction."" You see many people walking, running, riding bikes or skateboarding. A lot of people like this new idea that people are going by, it's an great way to step foward to save the earth and its problems.

Over time, Americans haven't been buying cars, driving less, and over years less people get their license. America is hitting its driving peak, The number of miles driven peaked in 2005 and then decreased signifigantly since then. Not many can afford a brand new car, or the insurance, most people are unemployed and dont work at all. Cars have been around for a long time, but over that time period it has caused major life impacting issues. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift,"" said mimi sheller. Many people aren't aware of this ""Car Free"" idea, which is an disadvantage. If this idea was spread through televison, newspapers, or even social media many people will pick it up and take it into consideration.

In an overall sum up, it is better to live ""Car Free."" You wouldn't have to stress yourself out about gas prices, fixing your cars, or your world becoming a big ball of heat. If Transportation and power plants are the two major impacts in our lives, we need to knock one out. Until, we can get some second options on power plants our best choice is to forbid cars. We have many other options to get around our city, running, walking, riding bikes or etc. The ""Car Free"" idea is very creative, not many people would take inisuative to help make the world a better and safer place. With an exception of a few, buses and taxis will be there for long distance trips. Cars caused a huge impact on our lives, but hurting us and our home which we call earth. The business plan is ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey."" Think of all the advantages cars have given, but think about all of the disadvantages the cars have showed. Which one out weighs the other?

llama_70b_v1389,"Video games have been a popular form of entertainment for decades, and they have evolved significantly over the years. However, there is an ongoing debate about the impact of video games on behavior, particularly in regards to violent behavior. I strongly believe that video games can contribute to violent behavior, and I will provide several reasons and examples to support my argument.

First and foremost, video games have become increasingly realistic and graphic, which can desensitize players to violence. Games like Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto feature lifelike graphics and intense violence, which can make players feel like they are actually partaking in violent acts. Studies have shown that exposure to violent media can lead to an increase in aggressive thoughts and behaviors, and video games are no exception.

Another reason why video games can contribute to violent behavior is that they often reward players for violent actions. In many games, players are encouraged to engage in violent behavior to progress through the game or earn rewards. For example, in the game Manhunt, players earn points for stealthily killing enemies, which can lead to a culture of violence and aggression. This can have a negative impact on players, particularly children and adolescents, who may not have the critical thinking skills to differentiate between the virtual world and reality.

Furthermore, video games can have a lasting impact on children's emotional and social development. Studies have shown that exposure to violent video games can lead to a reduction in empathy and a decrease in prosocial behavior, such as helping others or resolving conflicts peacefully. This can lead to a cycle of violence, where children become desensitized to violence and are more likely to engage in violent behavior themselves.

Moreover, there have been several instances where video games have been linked to violent behavior in the real world. For example, in 2012, a mass shooting occurred at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises. The perpetrator, James Holmes, was known to be an avid player of violent video games, and some experts have argued that his exposure to these games may have contributed to his violent behavior. Similarly, in 2018, a shooting occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where the perpetrator, Nikolas Cruz, was also known to be a fan of violent video games.

In conclusion, video games can contribute to violent behavior due to their realistic and graphic nature, reward systems that encourage violence, and long-term impact on children's emotional and social development. While it is important to recognize that other factors, such as mental health and family environment, also play a role in violent behavior, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential impact of video games on behavior. Parents and guardians should be mindful of the games their children play and ensure that they are not exposed to violent media. Additionally, game developers should consider the potential impact of their games on players and strive to create games that promote positive behavior and social interactions.",1,llama_70b_v1,"There is an ongoing debate about the impact of video games on behavior.

3CC68E5F3802,"When your looking for advice go to multiple people that you trust when seeking their advice. Asking more than one person can lead you to the right answers or choices you have to decided to make. Asking more people can give you more choices and ideas to choose about something. Hearing multiple people and their opinions can make you feel good about your choice and not make you regret the choice you chosen. Some people might have bad ideas and some might have good ideas,put those together and the right choice is there for you.

Asking more than one person can lead you to making the right choice or answers because some people might have bad ideas and some may have good ideas. Hearing people bad ideas will shorten your choices of making a bad choice about something that can't be undo. Hearing other people good ideas can give you even more good choices to add on to your choose you chosen. Getting advice from other people is a good thing also because some people are going to tell you what you want to here,but most people is going to tell you what you don't want to here. The right answers is always what you don't want to here because the people that tells you what you want to here is just trying to make you feel better than telling you the right answer.

Another reason for asking multiple people you can get more ideas about something. Everybody is not the same, people like different things so when asking multiple people rather than one person you can get different ideas from everybody to come up with your own idea. Some people are creative and good thinkers when it comes to giving advice or ideas so when you asking one person something you only hearing one person idea and advice instead you can be listening to multiple people. If you only asking one person you can get either a bad choice or a good answers but when asking multiple people you can most likely get a good choice. You just have to trust the people your seeking for advice and ideas from to make your choice a good choice.

Finally when your Hearing more than one person advice or idea you can feel like you made the right choice because you heard all these bad and good advice or ideas from other people. Other people who are different form each other,who have different personality and ideas. This makes you not regret the choice you chosen because all the people you trust gave you advice ad ideas so all you got to do is put everybody opinion together and come up with your choice. If you only took advice and ideas form one person you would second guess yourself because you heard one advice that might be bad or good. Everybody is creative in their own way and at different things not just one person.

Conclusion is that people should go to multiple people instead of one person. They want to make a good choice so going to multiple people you can hear different advice or ideas than hearing one person. Going to multiple people that you trust and won't tell you what you want to hear is going to lead you to the right choice. Ask people who are creative and hard thinkers they will give great advice or ideas. when coming up with your choice take everybody advice and yours and you will get the right choice or idea about something.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
EE855A723FE0,"Group work is an essential part of life; it can have real beneficial effects on many aspects of life, from school projects to career success. Through group work, members of a team can all learn from one another and help the progress of the project. 

I have experienced the positives of working in a group firsthand. In high school, I worked with several of my classmates on a large research paper. Working together gave us access to our teachers‚Äô expertise, as well as the chance to apply our individual skill sets to a collective problem. We applied our strengths and weaknesses to the task, resulting in a well-crafted piece of work that would have been much harder to achieve by ourselves. 

Another instance in which I experienced the benefits of group work was during my college internships. When working on large projects such as web designs and software development, I found that the combination of the creative ideas generated by our diverse team led to the highest quality results. Furthermore, each teammate had different specialized skills that contributed to the final product, all of which I was able to learn from.

In conclusion, it is clear that working in a group can bring many benefits. Not only can members learn from one another, but also, each person's individual strengths can be combined to create results that could not have been achieved on their own. From my own personal experience, I can say that the importance and benefits of working in a group cannot be overstated.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

983D16297775,"Advice is important to some people and most of the time they ask more than one person. There are 3 different reasons to why people ask for advice. First some people ask what to do in a situation and pick the best answer. The second reason is that they might need your opinion on something. The last reason is that some people ask for it because it might help get through hard times to make life easier.

When people are in a situation they tend to ask other people for advice so they can fix a problem. An example of this is, you ask three of your friends, "" My TV is broken what should i do?"". The first friend says, "" Try to fix it."" Then you ask the second friend and he/she says, "" Call somebody to fix it for you."" then the last friend says, "" I could help you I fixed a TV before."". Now that you have some choices you can pick the best one. If the one you picked that you think is best fails then you can try 2 other choices or ask for more advice.

Opinions can be important to people too for example lets say you were going to prom and you had to pick a dress. You walk up to your friends and they help you pick a dress. The first friend tells you, "" I think this purple dress would look good on you. '. The second tells you, "" No i think she should put on a blue dress."". Then the last¬†friend says, "" Maybe red would look good."". After you ask you can try out the dresses to see which one looks better or just keep asking till you fine the one you like.

Life is a very hard subject not to many people ask advice for this and its the most important thing people ask. When people ask about life its usually when people are having a hard¬†time For example, Lets say you have been feeling sad lately because you feel like your useless and have no talent. So you ask you family and your mom says, "" Its okay¬†dear¬†you'll find something."". Next you ask your dad and he says,"" Its okay it will just take a while."". and lastly you ask your brother and he says,"" Dont worry ill try to help you find your talent."". As you ask you start to feel better. That type of advice is suppose to help you feel better and help you with life.

Thats why people ask for advice from different people. To help them cope with life, for an opinion, and lastly to help them with a situation. Advice can really help people sometimes just be careful¬†with who you ask.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

If the technology is acurate with its calculations we can help the people that are suffering from depression and are sucidal.

54E67CFD7039,"Distance learning is becoming more common as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. By doing this, individuals will be gaining an education without being in a public or private school environment. People have a variety of different opinions on distance learning through distinguishing pros and cons. I think students will not benefit from distance learning because students are less likely to be motivated, lose social skills, and lose preparation for college life.

Students are more motivated when having a teacher right in front¬†of them to do what they are supposed to do. If students were to learn through distance learning, students can easily lose focus on their school work and put it aside without a teacher pushing them in the right direction. When there is a reason for me to stay home from school, I am never motivated to start my schoolwork. Students need guidance from a teacher that is physically in front of them rather than online or video conferencing. Without this, students lose their motivation and could fall behind in their academics. It is much easier for students to fall behind more instead of catching up when there is no motivation there to keep going. Also, students are all different and learn in different ways. I am someone who learns better when someone is directly in person. I am able to ask questions easier and more efficiently when a teacher is there to answer. Although distance learning can benefit students who learn better this way, there are still students who could use this excuse as a way to stay home and abandon their schoolwork. Students are less likely to be motivated in their academics which will not benefit them in the future.

Students who use distance learning can lose their social skills attained during public and private schools. Students go to school for their education, but there is also a social aspect with peers all around them. Social skills are taught through a student's individual self when placed in a social environment. Social skills can be beneficial to an individual's future because they are needed in almost any career. When students are older, social skills are used to gain a career because an individual must be able to have basic conversations and be social with customers, clients, patients, and other employees. Distance learning can take away social skills since it is also taking away the social aspect of school. Students who are distance learning lose the ability to communicate with unknown peers and solely rely on the internet for learning. School is also a way for students to create long lasting friendships when going to school. If social skills are not learned, it is much harder for students to create friendships. Although some people believe that friendships are not needed in life, but being able to have a friend who can be there to help during hard times can help an individual significantly. When I am struggling, not only with school, but with other personal issues, friends are a very good option to go to. With distance learning, students will lose the opportunity to obtain friendships and could lose their social skills.

Students can lose preparation for college life since college is usually in person and away from home. In today's society, most students who graduate high school will most likely go on to further their education in college. With long distance learning, students will have a harder time being away from home since their educational environment is their own home. If students attend school, they are already used to being in a public or private school environment that has similarities to college life. School prepares students for attending classes, waking up on time, and being able to manage their time. From experience, I would not have been able to learn to do this without school in person. In college, students will have to do the same types of things, but students who distance learn have to get used to the college lifestyle. Students who do public or private schooling already obtained these skills. However, with distance learning, students do not have a structured schedule for what their day will be like. Although some people believe that attending classes from home is more beneficial, students will have a harder time transitioning to college. Since distance learning is very different from how life will be like in college, students will not be as prepared as someone who goes to a public or private school. This means that students can lose the ability to prepare for college life through distance learning.

The cons outweigh the pros for distance learning. Students who choose distance learning will most likely have to struggle more in the future. Students are less likely to be motivated, will lose social skills, and will lose preparation for college life through distance learning which means it will not be beneficial to students.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,2
8E3D896212F3,"Many people believe technology is becoming too advanced for our own good. Maybe they were right, technology is advancing at a rapid rate and can also invade one's privacy. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions such as happy, sad, disgust, surprised, and a few other basic emotions. There is debate whether this software should become avaible in classrooms for students and if it is valuable. It is not very valuable, it is an invasion of privacy to use this software to read a students' emotional responses to their work.

Schools around the world are becoming more and more advanced everyday. Students, freshman through seniors, at Floyd Central High School along with hundreds of tother high schools have ipads that students carry around and use in their everyday classes. If they were to have this new software it would not change very many things. ""For example, if you smile when a web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if your frown, the next ad will be different."" What does web ads have to do with a student's education? This only shows that students will be recorded at all times through their ipads and/or computers while they do their school work. This is a huge invasion of privacy to students everywhere who might have to use this new emotional expression software.

The article states, "" ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huang predicts.""Then it could modify the lesson, like the effective human instructor."" "" Though it sounds like a step towards the right direction in technology, students will be just as bored doing random classwork on a computer without emotion software watching their every move through a camera. Also, at least 60% of students do better with a teacher in front of them to help rather than learning things online. If this software acts as a effective human instructor, students will still grow confused because as the article states that ""...you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."". A student will most likely do better just having a teacher because of the facial expressions or body language a teacher gives while teaching can help them better retain the information given rather than a screen teaching it to them, and if a teacher is doing a lecture in front of a class there is no need for a student to have out a laptop computer or an ipad unless it is called for that class and the teacher would be able to answer questions, not the computer.

The Facial Action Coding System software should not be used in the classroom. It is not of value to a student's education, it would be a waste of money and time to install it onto student ipads or computers. It is a complete invasion of privacy to today's youth to be constantly looked at through a little camera just to see if they are confused or not when they could just simply raise their hand and ask a teacher. Though it has many benefits, it has more pros than cons. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is supposed to convince the audience reading it that Facial Action Coding System software should be put in schools, reading it would make one feel the opposite.

5818B1EE4923,"To the principal:

The gossip is going around, many of students are talking, quite like busy working bee's in a hive. It's everything all the students are talking about. Its the new policy you want. You're considering about changing our school policy towards our athletic department. Many students at our school have a C average. I personally do not agree that to participate in sports students most have a B average. I disagree with you're policy for three reasons. First, a C is an average grade. Second, sometimes the students grade is beyond their control. Last but not least, sports are supposed to be fun.

According to the NEG, National Education Group , a C is an average grade. When a student is at a C they have room for improvement. Nonetheless, they aren't failing either. However a C is still a passing grade. I see why you think students should be above average to be able to participate in sports. On the other hand, you would be depriving more than half of your schools population, who are still passing their class, from participating in sports.

In most occasions, students grades are lower because they don't know or comprehend the material. That could be for several reasons; either the student wasn't paying attention during class, he/she is incapable of learning the material, or the teacher doesn't teach very well. From past experiences, my grades have been lower than my usual standards due to my teacher.

Sometimes, its the teacher who doesn't teach, but rather tries to have the students teach themselves. Also, many students may have diseases such as dyslexia or ADD and they just don't know it. Therefore, those students may be incapable of learning the way the rest if the class does.

For my last reason, sports are a pass time. There supposed to be fun, to pass the time. Athletics should be nothing to have to stress over. I'd rather not do any sports, than stress over having an average grade to be able to participate. Seventy eight percent of students have a C average, a student that falls into that percentage might be the next ""Lebron James""

But with the new policy, you may never know.

Many students are worried that they wont be able to partake in the athletic department at our school. If your policy follows through, many students will be excluded from playing sports. I highly disagree with your policy. First of all, a C is an average grade, the student is not failing with a C. Also, on some occasions it is beyond the students control. Finally, Sports aren't supposed to be a critical situation , they're supposed to be fun. Taking away sports from kids is like taking the oval office from the president- they'll be left with nothing to do, and nowhere to go.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

falcon_180b_v1_892,"I think we should transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. One reason is that renewable energy is better for the environment. Fossil fuels release harmful pollutants into the air and contribute to climate change. Renewable energy, on the other hand, doesn't produce any harmful emissions.

Another reason is that renewable energy is a sustainable resource. Fossil fuels are finite resources, which means they will eventually run out. Renewable energy, like solar and wind power, is constantly replenished and will never run out.

Finally, renewable energy is becoming more affordable and accessible. The cost of solar panels and wind turbines has decreased significantly in recent years, making it easier for individuals and businesses to invest in renewable energy.

An example of a successful transition to renewable energy is Costa Rica. In 2019, Costa Rica generated 98% of its electricity from renewable sources, primarily hydropower and geothermal. This has helped the country reduce its carbon footprint and become a leader in sustainable energy.

People, might often say,"" but we are becoming more advanced, why are you so against that?"". I am not against us becoming a more advanced civilization, but I just think that the cars are worthless and not a good idea, and here is why.

Driverless cars, require you, the driver to still be alert, even though there is a computer driving it. This is because the comuter cannot travel through obstacles such as tough terrains, or bad roads that call for a,"" human's experience. So if the car is driven by a computer, that should actually make it able to handle any situation right? No, but yest people still want to produce it.

This is also a bad idea, because, think of the money that will have to be spent on creating all of these automobiles. This project could cost billions and billions of dollars just to equip the technology within the vehicle itself, let alone the cost to actually make the cars. The technology might not be an issue at all for many people around the world, but the money is deffinately an issue, the taxes and monthly revenues might go up even higher, just to fund the project to make these cars.

Finally, cars should not be driver less, because,they cost way too much money, which it states in the article that,"" radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars"". If this is true, then think about all of the money that will be paid in the future, due to the many of advancements in technology. The cars still call for a driver's touch, so the thing is that these cars are not fully able to drive without someone, and it is just a waste of time and money, to make something that still has to require that a human opperate and control it. Also, if an accident occures, then who is to blame, shuley not the manufacture, they weren't in the car, but wait their technology was. If an accident happens, then this could cause problems between people and the manufactures because the technolgy was the on in control of the car, but yet the person was in the car fully capable of driving it at the time, so exactly who is to blame for the incident.

Here is why cars should not be driverless, because they cost way too much money. They also need you to be alert at all times just in case there is an obstacle in the road.

7A9B42FE8719,"To the Principle:

Many students have a grade C average. If the policies state that students must have a grade B average, how will the students be able to play the sport or activity they want to?

Also, if a student has a 79% which is just a point below a grade B, then the teachers, principles, or coaches would make them quit. I don't see any reason for them to have to quit the sport or activity they enjoy participating in just for being one point under a B.

For example, if there were 10 kids, lets say that all of them currently participate in a sport. 7 of them have a grade C average, that would mean that more than half of them would have to quit the team. That would result in the sport having to quit for not having enough of team members. My point is that I think students should have at least a grade C point average to be able to participate in activities and sports, so that we wouldn't have to ruin our sports teams and activity organizations because of teachers making the members or participants quit for not having a grade B average. We don't want our teams and activities to have to give up what they accomplished because the teacher wants them to have a better grade. Some students aren't that equipped or qualified to reach a B, so they end up with a C. If that student wants to play a sport and the policy was that you had to have a grade b average he would have to quit then he would be stressed to bring up his grade so that he could go back to whatever sport or activity he was involved in.

15FD2E229EA8,"Would you wanttolive in a world where driving is now done by computers? I mean, wouldn't that just be sweet? Well, I'm going to let you on a little secret that I call the ""Three Part Series"". This world would be dangerous, promote laziness, and would be quite expensive.

Firstly, this invention would be dangerous. Not only would these computers have to be programmed to completely analyze and control the road, but new laws will have to be published for these driverless cars. In paragraph 9, it says ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident."" which over all make you stop and think. If this tecnology fails or makes a mistake, who is at fault, you the driver or the manufacturer? Will driving tests still be required in case of an emergency or will everyone lack the knowledge of driving? It's so dangerous that California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia has started to limit the use ofsemi-autonomous cars.

Secondly, this invention will not only promote laziness but bring about other inventions that will promote computer controlled programs. These cars will provide a better respose and control than a human, like it says in paragraph 5, so will this push us to be less aware of the roads and dangers of accidents? You might say ""what's so bad about that?"", well not only are you losing your everyday self-awareness but you're allowing yourself to become lazy. No longer will your attention be on the road but instead focused on the lastest updated picture of Justin Bieber, while you drink a sweet tea from the dollar menu. Sooner or later you'll be the girl/boy everyone has seen give their clothes to a robot to wash them or your kitchen to a robot who cooks for you.

Lastly, not only will you be lazy, but, you'll be broke too. In 2000, ""Radar"" or these driverless cars we're estimated to cost 200 million dollars. I don't know about you, but I know there's no way I'll be spending 200 million on driverless car when that's all I'm estimated to make for a LIFETIME. With the price of this car, I can imagine how much money these companies will be needing just to manufacturer one set each of these cars. So, just take a minute and think how money these companies are going to blow that can be used towards something else, like charity,at-risk neighborhoods, homeless shelters or even just rehab centers. So, ultimately you'll be spending more on this car then you'll make in a lifetime or even spend in a lifetime.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I still agree and stand by my ""Three Part Series"" or TPS for short. As you can see, not only will this car be inefficient but it will be expensive, dangerous, and will promote laziness.

ba489c6d,"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly clear, as demonstrated by examples from around the world. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, has implemented a car-free policy, with only two places available for car parking. As a result, 70% of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars when they moved there. The residents of Vauban have found that giving up their cars has led to a decrease in stress and an overall increase in happiness. This trend is not limited to Germany; it is growing in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world.

Limiting car usage is an essential step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By separating suburban life from the use of cars, communities like Vauban are able to drastically reduce emissions from tailpipes. This approach is known as ""smart planning"" and involves making suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, as well as reducing the space available for parking. By placing stores within walking distance on a main street, instead of in malls along highways, communities can encourage residents to rely less on cars for their everyday needs.

Efforts to limit car usage are gaining traction in the United States as well. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are beginning to take action. It is expected that public transportation serving suburbs will play a much larger role in federal transportation bills in the coming years. In the past, the majority of funding has gone towards highways, but that is likely to change as the importance of reducing car usage becomes more widely recognized.

Other cities around the world are also implementing car-free initiatives. Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to combat smog, and the ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion. Bogota, Colombia has been hosting a car-free day for the past few years, which has gained popularity and drawn the attention of municipal authorities from other countries. These cities are discovering that limiting car usage not only improves air quality but also promotes alternative transportation options, reduces stress, and creates a more connected and vibrant community.

The decrease in driving and car ownership in the United States may indicate a fundamental shift in American behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This trend could have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is one of the largest sources of emissions in the country. While the decrease in driving can partly be attributed to the recession, researchers believe that there is something more fundamental going on. Factors such as the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of center cities, and the availability of car-pooling apps are all contributing to a cultural shift away from car dependence.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and impactful. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving air quality and reducing stress, communities around the world are finding that embracing alternative transportation options and creating car-free spaces can lead to significant benefits. By reimagining suburbs and promoting the use of public transportation, walking, and biking, we can create more sustainable and vibrant communities for future generations.",1,radek_500,,4
97A8C7304C25,"Dear Principal ,

I am up for your new idea to have a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities.

One reason is because if the students know they have to have a B average to participate in any school activities they're grades will go up and it'll be more honor students and no failures. They'll also want to keep they're grades up so they wont get kicked off the team because if its something they really enjoy doing why would they want to stop because of they're grades being bad.

Another reason is they'll focus more, by focusing more they'll know how and what to do on they're homework instead of not doing it because they don't understand so that means they'll pay attention more, which helps the teacher not get off task cause she knows someone isn't paying attention and I know the students who really pay attention would like that because they wont get distracted while they're trying to learn.

My last reason for this idea would be less getting in trouble, the more they know they'll get kicked off the team for the trouble they get in to and their grades, so that means they'll stay out of the drama and trouble they see. And them staying out of trouble could lead them somewhere good in the future and I know the principal would enjoy not seeing kids in the office for getting in trouble.

Summer projects should be designed by students because they can create projects they want to complete, they can incorporate their real-world knowledge and experience, and they can design a project they know will be possible for them to complete.

Despite the benefits of student-designed projects, those who favor ones designed by teachers point to the fact that teachers can base projects off the curriculum students will have to learn during the school year and thus help students feel more prepared. However, students who design these summer projects can easily be given a description of the required curriculum to guide them while they design their projects. This will allow them to find ways they can incorporate the material into an achievable project. Additionally, teachers who are focused solely on the curriculum may end up assigning a project that students do not understand due to a lack of prior knowledge needed to complete the project. Students can pick a part of the curriculum they may already have some background knowledge about to create a project that will help them take an in-depth look at something they will be learning more about. Thus, it is possible for students to create a project that addresses important parts of the material they will learn.

Students who are able to design their own projects can create projects they are interested in completing, leading to a more engaging learning experience. When asked to complete a project they are interested in, students are more likely to complete the assignment and be enthusiastic about what they learn in the process. This elevated engagement presents itself in increased academic achievement, including higher scores on standardized tests, and better retention of material, instead of forgetting it as they continue on their academic path. This level of engagement and the associated benefits is lacking in teacher-designed projects because they do not cater to the interests of the students. These projects miss out on the benefits found in student-designed projects. Thus, while teacher-designed projects may share short-term benefits such as better understanding of the material, they do not maintain the long-term retention necessary for later successes such as boosted standardized test scores. When students design the projects, they are able to create a more engaging experience that leads to better learning.

Students are able to incorporate their knowledge and experience into projects they design, whereas teachers might assign one that they are unfamiliar with. Teachers do not know the experiences of the students they are designing projects for, so they may create one that students struggle applying their real-world knowledge to or one that only focuses on the curriculum instead of ways the learning material can be applied to life outside of school. Students can find creative ways to link what they learn in school to its applications in the real world. This better prepares students for their future lives and careers, where they will be applying what they learned in school instead of being continually tested on it. These students are more prepared for what they will be doing after they finish their education because of this prior experience in applying their knowledge and experience. This also reminds students that there is a world outside of school, creating worldly citizens who are able to apply what they learned to solving problems.

Students can be assured that they will have a project that they can complete when they design their own project, instead of one that may be too challenging or that they might not have the resources to complete. Teachers who are unfamiliar with the students and their circumstances may overestimate the students and create a project that is too difficult for students to complete on their own. They might also design a project that students do not have the ability to complete-if a teacher were to assign an essay on what a student learned by traveling, a low-income student may not be able to do it if their family cannot afford to travel. Students are more familiar with their own abilities and resources and can create a project that will provide a good challenge while not being too confusing or difficult. Reaching out for assistance would also be easier, as confused students could reach out to their peers instead of a teacher they do not know. Teachers are prone to creating a project that may be difficult or impossible to students they are unfamiliar with, but students are able to design ones based on their own abilities and resources.

Students should design summer learning projects because they can create more interesting ways to learn, they can design ways to incorporate their real-world experiences to the academic curriculum, and they can make a project that will not be too difficult for them to complete over summer break. Students can design more engaging projects based on their interests that will ultimately increase benefits such as higher standardized tests scores and retention of material. Their ability to design projects that incorporate the curriculum into the real world will better prepare them for life and work after they complete their education. In school districts where summer projects are used, parents should advocate for student-designed projects to better their children's education.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
53B9330A8106,"Dear Principal,

You letting us use our phones can be one of the best things you can do. Mostly because how many kids do you think get sent down to your office because the got caught using their phone during class? 20,25, or about 10 students a day is the answer. How many minutes do you waste lecturing them about why it is wrong and then you give them a referral? i would estimate around 5 minutes for each one that would mean you have just wasted more than 1 hours a day just lecturing them about using their phones. that's a lot of time being wasted. Now for you this is time that could have been used to do your work or file papers. Know image yourself that you didn't have that problem you would finish your work early, focus on other things you had in mind and maybe finish work that was due next week . Now that would mean more work time, more you time, and of course more relaxation.

Even though you say that it's still going to be bad and out of control well your wrong because when young adults have the time to themselves using their phones and sending texts during their free time ,why would they need to talk to someone later? In my opinion i know that giving us the time to use our cell phones would mean that kids have a better time at school, meaning they would want to come back.

Principle if you don't do this you are probably going to have to work overtime at the office , you would have to do your work that was do yesterday today just because of this phone policy of yours. Now Principle i think the right thing to do would be to go with policy #1.

6B32D01DB822,"Have you ever had to make a super hard decision, and didn't know who to ask for advice from? Well, if you ever have to go through that, I highly recommend asking multiple people for their input. There are so many benefits of doing this including hearing different point of views, listening to people who have gone through similar situations, and seeing how the majority of people respond. If anything, asking multiple people for advice can only help you in the long run.

The first reason you should always ask multiple people for advice is hearing different point of views. You could ask 3 different people how they would handle your situation and they could all have completely opposite answers. Everyone has their own take and perspective on the problem. It's really important to listen to what everyone has to say so you can make the best choice based on all the advice you were given. Asking a group of people for advice, instead of just one, can really open your eyes on all the ways you can handle the conflict.

The next reason that you should ask more than one person for advice is being able to listen to people who have gone through similar situations. People in a group could have gone through similar problems and could tell you what they did and how the outcome turned out. It would be really great for you so that way you can avoid using strategies they used that didn't work out. You can also pick up on the good things they did to handle the problem and use them to your advantage. Overall listening to multiple people who have gone through the same thing can be extremely helpful.

Lastly, I think asking a group of people for advice would be great, so that way you can see how the majority of people respond. If most of the people in a group agree on one way of handling the issue, that probably means you should keep that in mind. A lot¬†of the time, the majority of people can really impact your decision. Listening to what the majority of people say can be a really good tool for you to use when making a difficult choice. Overall listen to what others have to say, and it will really help you out!

It's really necessary to listen to other's opinions when making a tough decision. It's also really beneficial to hear multiple people's thoughts. The benefits of that are hearing different of point of views, listening to people who have gone through similar conflicts, and seeing how the majority of people respond to your issue. So the next time you need to make a difficult decision, don't forget to ask more than one person for advice.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3

b6ec786f,"All around the world different countries have been noticing some things in life that are just better without cars or atleast less cars. With less cars things are more calming its also better for everyone, including the environment.

To begin with, things can be way more calm in a life without cars. Many people happen to believe that cars can change how you feel for example ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way""3. Heidrun Walter always felt tense with a car now she feels calm and relaxed. Life with less cars can be so much more relaxing without all the loud annoying noises cars make. In Vauban they are making some changes to how the people live so they can live more easy and calm. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in a lowcar suburban life.""6. The way this civilization is all the people live close by and everything is close by so you dont really need a car. If everything is close by everything can be more fluent and calm.

In addition, it may be more calm without cars but it is also better for you and the environment. ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emission in europe... and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.""5. Wherever you are in the world greenhouse gasses will most likley affect your environment in some unnatrual way and that is not the best thing for you, the people you know, or all the plants and animals. Without cars polluting earth we would be way more healthy and many animals may not be endangered or extinct like they are today.""how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.""7. If you drive less its not just better for the environment and your health it can also be better for your wallet. If you drive less you save money on gas that you can use for many other things. Overall driving less turns out to be better for everyone.

In conclusion, people driving less can make life easier and calmer, it is also better for people, plants, animals, and don't forget your wallet.",0,train_essays,,8
4FDC96B8E462,"Many European countries have been making a move towards limiting car usage in efforts of halting pollution, adding exercise to everyday life, conserve resources, and improve safety for others. An example of this phenomenon is Vauban, Germany, where suburbs are not allowed to drive vehicles. Doing this has helped improve society by bringing people closer to each other and removing the stress of traffic. Other people create a holiday for this, Car-free day, where people can only get around by public transportation and walking. As countries become more urbanized, there is a lesser need for cars to get around as the city is closing in on us.

Various countries have been making cities more dense and bring stores and businesses closer to neighborhoods, with the idea of Smart Planning. This idea is making communities more compact, like Vauban's 5,500 residents living within a square mile. With this, the need of cars is drastically reduced, creating a stress free environment that is less polluted and clean. Also, to dicourage the use of cars, there are only parking garages on the edge of town and barely any parking spots, leaving more room for sidewalks and housing developement. People began to walk socialize along the way, allowing exercise and social benefits.

Car pollution has been a major problem ever since the first cars were made. In the Paris, the smog became so thick, they had to partially ban driving. Even license plates one day, the next odd license plates. Congestion was down 60% after 5 days of intense smog. This pollution was due to the French government subsidizing and favoring Diesel fuels. In this time, all public transits were free of charge and people walked to get to where they needed to be. However, delivery companies lost revenue, but exceptions such as plug in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying 3 or more people.

In America, the reccession has had a devastating effect on some people, many couldn't afford to drive due to gas prices, and sold their cars. ""A study last year has found that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009"". This means that Public Transportation, car-pooling, and pedestrian are becoming a more commonly used way of getting from A to B, and are more affordable.

Companies like Ford got together at the Mobile World Congress and laid out a business plan for a world in which vehicle ownership is impractical and undesirable. Their chairman, Bill Ford, proposed partnerships with telecommunication companies. They want to make cities that are more based on pedestrain, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportion. Doing this, they think it will save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.

The world changes slowly, and these ideas might never catch on. Today, there is a lesser need of cars as cities become more urbanized and as we start facing an environmental problem. Better city layouts are being made to reduce the need for vehicles by bring businesses closer to neighborhoods. People are sponsoring no car days, smog reduces, and people find that they don't need cars to get around.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
E49C5B1441FA,"Driverless cars are a new and unique thing that has been dreamed about since the inception of the automobile itself, no longer is there the human error in driving. I for one, strongly support driverless cars. There are many reasons why there should be an allowance for driveless cars, but there are also some disadvantages.

With driveless cars, the room for human error is completely removed, we are not a precise as a computer with radar, sensors, other digital devices. We as humans can become distracted and unfocused when driving, but driveless cars cannot, greatly reducing the number of accidents.

Also, Google Car has been on the road since 2009 and has not had a single accident. Whereas there are hundreds of wrecks, accidents, and casulties due to human error. There are of course the posibility of glitches, malfuctions, and other bugs that may affect the system, but when propperly ironed out and taken care of by the manufacturers, it should provide a much safer expierience on the road.

Another reason is that all ""driverless"" cars still need a drive to some degree. This could be seen either as good or bad. I personally see it as good. You do not have robot cars rolling around the street with no supervision or abillity to override in case of a malfucntion in the computer controlling the vehicle. All the person in the vehicle needs to do is take over the wheel drive how we are currently.

Driveless cars are part of the continuing and growing field of technology where there is rapid progress and advancements. It is part of an everchanging field that is full of constant innovations and changes. If a driveless car is not precise enough to drive through construction zones or the scene of an accident, it will be able to eventually due to how quickly technology evolves and builds upon itself. It will continue to expand in both predicable advancements and those we wouldn't have thought of.

While there is some concern over whether we should allow driverless cars, I myself fully support them and their development for a number of reasons, such as the removal of human error, lack of accidents, requirement of a driver, and constant evolution. I believe that it is only a matter of time until what was considered fiction in the past becomes a reality in the future.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
201241D24A3E,"Distance learning is defined as online classes or video conferencing. In other words, it's homeschooling. Students who are enrolled in distance learning usually end up in that position due to life factors such as bullying, disabilities, or mental illness. The discussion of whether this is beneficial or detrimental to students is a gray area, with both sides making reasonable arguments. However, I personally am against distance learning. Homeschooling offers a controlled environment with little disruption, but it hinders a child's social skills. Although learning in ones household gives students more freedom in the day to move around when they want, they also have the freedom to ignore their responsibilities and not do the work. A student's concentration levels can increase, but staring at a screen for long periods of time can cause irritation to the eyes. There's nothing wrong with the idea of taking lessons outside of school, but to be aware of the issues with learning from home is necessary.

For starters, distance learning contributes very little to the social skills of a student. Imagine pulling a child out of school, away from their friends and favorite teachers, and plopping them down in an empty room with nothing but a computer and some scratch paper and telling them, ""This is how you're going to take lessons from now on"". Although this can be resourceful to students on the autism spectrum or other health problems, keeping them stuck inside a house all alone may do more harm than good. For example, an old friend of mine from Generic_City is home schooled. While they didn't mind it, they would oftentimes gripe about how unbearably lonely and depressed they were; they couldn't go anywhere, there was nothing to do and there was nobody they knew in real life to talk to. Students will be unable to engage in opportunities to interact with people around their age, nor can they participate in any events or extracurricular activities. As a result, they could grow up socially awkward or verbally impulsive, negatively affecting their chance at proper growth.

Secondly, the concept of students working at home can be difficult to manage. When a teenager takes online classes or video conferencing, nobody is making sure they're doing their assignments. Young people are lazy by nature; when a teacher or adult leaves the room, we lose focus and chat among¬†each other. In a controlled environment this wouldn't be a problem, but with nobody supervising the student, it makes it easier for them to neglect their classwork and do whatever they want. When I took homeschooling for a mere three days, I did very little of my homework; I found the task boring and pointless, and eventually I returned to public school. Additionally, online classroom assignments are more time consuming and challenging than what public school has to offer. This only further discourages the student from applying any amount of effort into their classwork, especially if they cannot understand the subject.

Finally, the reason why distance learning is not as effective as in-school learning is due to how homebound students are taught. In today's age we learn with the help of technology, using sideshows and laptops¬†to simplify lessons for the young. Students in public school, while relying on electronics for information, don't get as much screen time as home schooled¬†kids do; taking online classes requires a computer. If a home schooled¬†student spends this much time scrolling and clicking through each and every lesson, that would mean the average screen time they receive is twice more than what publicly schooled students are exposed to. As harmless as it may sound, staring at a bright white screen can cause irritation to the eyes, causing tension headaches or nearsightedness; it can wear out your back or increase the likelihood of suffering from depression or anxiety. I used to have an addiction to my electronic devices. As a result, I was cranky and miserable, and my eyes and back were sore from sitting hunched over my phone. If a student benefits from learning through a computer, there is nothing wrong with that. That doesn't mean, however, every home schooled¬†child can afford to stare at a screen for hours a day without feeling physically or mentally drained.

We all want the best for our youth, but doing that requires the process of making difficult choices. Distance learning provides an opportunity for students, yet doing so may hurt their behaviors in secretive ways. Students--specifically those with mental disabilities--can thrive in a learning environment without the fear of being bullied, but it can prevent them from meeting new people in both the classroom and in an after-school activity. Homeschooling has a more controlled, less disruptive environment, yet with no teacher present it can give way to laziness. Technology makes learning easier, but for students who have to learn electronically everyday, their physical and mental health are at risk of harm. The solution to this would be to eventually enroll a child into public schooling once they're at an appropriate age; distance learning is effective to others depending on their character, but as they grow up, it's better for them to develop and flourish alongside students in their grade rather than by themselves.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
F776F9881474,"Have you ever had to do a summer project because I have and it sucked because the project that the teacher gave me was boring but if I got to choose my summer project I would choose something that I will enjoy and be able to learn.

If students had a choice to pick a summer project or let the teacher decide I am pretty sure most if not all of the students will let them self¬†choose. I remember when I was in like 5th or 6th grade and my teacher was like ""I know its the end of the year but you guys and girls are gonna have to do a summer project"". After she said that everyone hated her for the rest if the summer and not just because she gave us a summer project but also because it was very boring but if it was not boring then I am pretty sure everyone would not be as mad as they were.

I believe that if students got to choose the summer project then more students will get it done. I know for a fact that if I was to get a summer project it would not most likely not get done but if I had a choice to pick it or have my teacher pick it I would pick it my self any day of the week. If I would was to choose my own summer project then I am almost 100% sure most kids would like to pick their own summer project. Just like 2 summers ago I had to go to summer school because I was not doing so good in my cases and the teacher said that all we had to do was a project and we would¬†be all good and we will be ok to go to the next grade so I was relived so I went home and got started on it but when I got started I realized that it was boring and if something was boring I was probaly not going to get it done.

I am saying all of this to say I think that if schols make kids do summer projects they should be able to pick what they are going to do because it will be more fun, more kids will do it, and it gives a chance for kids to think on their own.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

A4FD67097CFD,"Computers are something of the present, and man-kind is hoping for more efficient computers in the future. More and more lately students are being assigned a computer of their own supplied by the school. Sometimes these computers are used for bad but mostly good. The Facial Action Coding System could be helpful for furthering academics in school corporations and could be used to help state testing which has just recently been switched to online.

The Facial Action Coding System is something that school should invest in. It should not become something that everyone needs to have because some schools cannot even afford books! For the schools that can afford this program it could be made beneficial many different ways. For example, many students become tired using their computers, so if the computer reads the child is becoming tired it could offer an academic game or a brain teaser to make the child more lively. The article states, "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts.' Then is could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" This program can also read happiness and sadness. Some students suffer from depression and have thoughts of suicide. This program could notify the teacher or counselor if the student is continuously sad or angry. This could help prevent things such as school shootings, self mutilation, or even suicide.

Some people may argue this program is taking away from a teachers job or is could be used for the wrong things. Technology has taken the load off of teachers in the last ten years, but it has also caused some harm. With technology comes the problems of students not having their computers charged, money shortages, and things breaking. Those things have distracted from students learning. In the big picture, do the pros outweigh the cons?

In the overall outlook on furthering a student's computer's capability using this program is the better option. Everything comes with problems. It does add something more to a teachers plate, but it also helps a teacher make a connection with the student. The Facial Action Coding system is beneficial and should be considered by school corporations around the world. ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
CCDD77656701,"Do you thing that most danger of us lies not setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark? Sometimes is not good to tell others what you want because some of them may not want good things for you to get or have, you want to not used too much you phone, you want to loose some weight, and you want to graduated from high school.

Today in day many people used their phone a lot and sometimes they don't do things because they spend most of their time on their phones. For example, you get home from school and you have to do some homework, but you don't want to do it yet because you just got home from school, and you tell your self that you will relax for a few hours, and then you will start to do your homework. You ate dinner and everything you go to your room and one of your friends ask you if you want to play videos game? you tell your self I will play a little bit and then I will start to do my homework. Two hours pass by and you are still playing videos games. You tell your friend I must stop playing because I have to start doing my homework and your friend tells you don't go, we ask someone to give us copy, and you say yes, because you want to continue do keep playing. When you get to school you don't have any body to ask to give you copy. It was your choice to keep playing. That day you make a plant you put a timer and when that timer stop you will stop doing what you are doing. It work because when you time your self you can do more than one thing, you could also have more time to just play but the good thing is you have finish all you things.

For new year resolution you say that you will loose some weight this year. Your family laugh at you because you had said that almost every year and you have not do it. Sometimes is good to just tell your self to do things and don't tell anyone because some people don't want others to get things because they want to get it first and if they don't get it. Those kind of people don't want others do get it also. If you want to loose weight just do it and don't tell any body because you don't know what others want for you. It's better to do things in secret because at the end you are the one you are doing it and no body is helping you. The things that you do are for you not for everyone. When you have your things you can tell to your closer people and some of them may be happy for you and some may not, but that doesn't have to worry you because you have already do your thing and they can't do nothing to take that away from you. Your family may see you that you say things but you don't do it. You have to show them that you can do things that you say. You may feel sad because of what people say and you just have that in your mint. That is why not good to tell everyone of what you want to do because they may be jealous and they don't want you to be in a very good shape. Just go and workout and when they see you again they will say wow you look different what did you did to look great; they will not see you as a lair because you show them that you can do things. It can take time to see the different but you are doing it.

When you are in school you will have friends that are good for you and also those that are not. When you are in high school you want to pass all your classes so you can make your parents proud and they can be happy; but their will be some friends that will tell you to go out and have fun etc. In school their will be students that care about classes and their will be that they don't care. You want to be with those friends that help each other to have good grades. Their will be friends that don't like you and want to get you in some trouble, and they will want you to don't have good grade and be like them. You want to be with friends that support each other. Also you don't want to be that kind of person that say you have good grade and you don't have those good grades and you just are copying others and when it's test time you don't know what to do because you didn't do the work by your self. To get things that you want; you have to work for it. It's better to have friends that help each other and that also that help you to do your work and can be easy for you to also help others.

People may disagree with this because they have good people around them and that they help each other. They may say this because they haven't go through things like; one of your friends don't like you and they don't want you to have the things you want. Sometimes is better to do things and don't tell everyone because you don't know what people really want for you or what they think of the things you want. In this world are people that they don't care what you, they will agreed with what you do and if you felt they always be with you, their is those that they don't want you and others to be happy. The best thing to do is just do things and when you have it tell to everyone that you want because when you already have it they can just talk bad things of you and you don't stay in front of them as a looser because you didn't they don't know how you did it. Us human been we always have the thing inside of us that always make us jealous for what others have. For example, If one of your friends have a news phone you will get a little bit jealous because you also want to have that phone. Every single person in this world has when through that. That's why people don't trust each others.

It's better to do things that no body know because if you felt or don't get what you want, their will not be people that knew. You didn't get it and they will not be talking bad things of you or look at you as a looser that you can't do anything. You will be the only one that will know and if you want to tell them you can it will be your choice.

92D03AB56C53,"Winston Churchill's famous phrase, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,"" emphasizes the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity. This means that success is not a destination, but rather a journey, and failure is a natural part of that journey. Failure is not a permanent setback, but rather an opportunity to learn and grow. It is the courage to continue despite the challenges and setbacks that we face along the way.

Failure is an important element to consider in the pursuit of success because it helps us to identify areas where we need to improve and to develop resilience. When we fail, we are forced to confront our weaknesses and to find ways to overcome them. We also learn to be more adaptable and to handle unexpected challenges. Failure can create problems if we allow it to define us and to give up. However, if we use failure as a learning opportunity and as a motivation to work harder, we can turn it into a stepping stone towards success.

There are many examples of how failure can lead to success. One such example is the story of Thomas Edison, who failed thousands of times before he finally invented the light bulb. Each failure brought him one step closer to success, as he learned from his mistakes and refined his design. Another example is the story of J.K. Rowling, who was rejected by multiple publishers before finally finding success with her Harry Potter series. Each rejection was a setback, but it also motivated her to keep writing and to improve her work.

When facing failure, it is important to take the right steps in order to create a successful outcome. The first step is to acknowledge the failure and to learn from it. This means reflecting on what went wrong and identifying the areas where we need to improve. The second step is to set new goals and to develop a plan for achieving them. This means breaking down the goal into smaller, more manageable steps and identifying the resources and support that we need to succeed. The third step is to take action and to persevere, even in the face of setbacks and challenges. This means staying motivated and focused, and not giving up when things get tough.

In conclusion, failure is an integral part of the success process. It helps us to identify areas where we need to improve and to develop resil",1,llammistral7binstruct,,9

Driverless cars can help decrese car accident rates as i mentioned earlier. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", it says in paragraph two "" Google has had cars that could driven independent under specific conditions since 2009."" These cars has driven more than half a million miles WITHOUT a crash, then again Google cars havent truly been driverless.

The driverless Google cars modified Toyota Prius have lots of sensors that are located on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror and many more. Theese cars are safe they have to be safe the driving law focus on saftey for the passengers, drivers, and pedestrians. some cars have sensors in the front and back that will break for you so you wont hit another car. That will help the drunk drivers fromhitting teen drivers and killing them.

Driverless cars will come in handy they are safe, and harmful. Drivers will still be able to control their cars. These cars will alert you when you need to take control , when you need to stop or they will stop for you. Cars that can drive themselves and keep drivers from hitting others equals a safter raod for young drivers.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

04147BBED91A,"Detecting Emotions

New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valuable, or it could be a waste of time, depending on how you look at it.

Technology has been upgraded throughout recent decades, and most recently, technology has taken a different approach. The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate, but is this really a better way to communicate? It comes down to the facts. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Everyone has different ways of expressing emotions, and not everyone feels the same emotions. Thinking that a computer could possibly detect your emotions is a bit silly, to some, and valuable to others. So what makes it silly to some? You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face, you can talk with them in person. Having physical contact is very important when it comes to emotions, using a computer to detect, sounds a bit far-fetched. Schools have teachers, and school counselors, so that students can talk express how they feel. Some people don't see why this feature could possibly be useful in a classroom.

There are many issues going on in the world, much worse than trying to figure our expressions. So, why aren't we using this tchnology, and these smart people to work on something more important? Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, what would you need it for? Human communication is very important, using a computer to detect how you feel is simply a waste of time, in some opinions. Making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotion. On the other hand, what could the Facial Action Coding System be useful for in classrooms? Students may be able to use this feature in physiciatry studies. Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling. However, a computer cannot feel, cannot have sympathy, and cannot understand many things about humans. Reaching the final conclusion is up to you. Is a computer being able to identify your emotions useful in classrooms, or not? ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
llama_70b_v1630,"Meat, its something we all love to eat. But, have you ever stopped to think about where it comes from? Like, seriously think about it. Cows, pigs, and chickens, they all have to die so we can eat them. And, its not just that, its the impact it has on the earth. Like, have you seen the Amazon rainforest lately? Its being cut down left and right for animal agriculture. And, let me tell you, its not just the animals that are suffering, its the indigenous people too. They're being forced off their land, their homes, so we can raise animals to eat. Its just not right.

And, let's not forget about our health. Eating too much meat has been linked to heart disease, diabetes, and even some cancers. Like, who wants to increase their risk of getting sick? Not me, that's for sure.

Now, I know what you're thinking. What about protein? Don't we need meat to get enough protein? The answer is no. You can get protein from plants, like beans, lentils, and tofu. And, let me tell you, they're way healthier than meat. They're lower in saturated fat and higher in fiber. Its a win-win.

So, what can we do? We can adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet. Its a great way to reduce our carbon footprint, help protect the environment, and improve our health. And, its not that hard. There are so many delicious plant-based options out there. You can still have your burgers, just make them out of black beans or lentils. You can still have your pizza, just use a vegan cheese. And, let me tell you, vegan ice cream is the bomb.com.

In conclusion, reducing meat consumption is a no-brainer. Its good for the earth, its good for our health, and its good for the animals. So, let's make a change. Let's adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet and do our part in protecting the planet and our bodies.

I am writing you on behalf of the students at SCHOOL_NAME

about the new cell phone policies that you are considering:

Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all.

Although I realize that Policy 2 has some benefits of its own I ask you to strongly consider Policy 1. Policy 1 you would only approve if you knew that you could trust us. So if you don't not approve that plan are you saying that you don't trust the kids at your school. That would only reflect badly upon you.

My second reason that you should allow kids to have phones at school would be because children should be learning by now that they should know when and when not it is appropriate to use cell phones. Allowing them never to learn this skill will only result in a future problem of our generation getting fired because they do not know when it is appropriate to take out there cell phone.

My third and final reason is that some parents after school forget to pick up there kids so the child needs some way of reaching them so that they are not forgotten. After all no school wants kids roaming around it 3 hours after school has ended because some parent forgot to pick up there kids.

When you are deciding iI hope you take my reasons into consideration.

86A39056FB93,"Giving up a car can be difficult. But if you all knew more about cars, perhaps you all would stop using them. Or at least limiting the usage of your car. Lowering the pollution rate in the world would defenetlly be an advantage. There would br more space for other things to be built. And besides, cars are a one of the many ways people die.

Cars are so mediocre for our environment. . ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" The percentage is lower in Europe due to the fact that Europeans drive less that the people in United States do. The Environmental Protection Agency are promoting ""car reduced"" communities in the United States. Beijing, China, is on eof the most polluted cities in the entire world. Many countries and cities are enforcing a partial driving ban to get rid of the air pollution. Places like France, Paris, London and even Bogota, Colombia. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlose Arturo, a businessman. Studies in¬† America show that as each year goes by, less and less Americansare buying or driving cars. Studies also show fewer licenses are getting distributed each year.

Driving fewer cars means that roads really aren't useful anymore. So, that leaves room for other things to be built. Things like parks, restaurants, shopping centers, and it woould be great for promoting or expanding companies. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hourrestrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

Finally, cars are one of the many ways people die. Statistics show that car crashes are more likely to happen than getting in a plane crash or any other type of collision. Especially for teens who have just got their license. Many peopole die from car crashes, just think about all the losses we could prevent from happening. Just because that person didn't mean anything to you doesn't mean they weren't loved by someone else.

In conclusion, you should see the many things we could avoid with cars. The many advantages we would have without cars. We would have less pollution, more space for other things to be built, and the lives of your loved ones. Even if you choose not to stop driving your car, at least limit the usage of it, or you coud car-pool.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

As I research the different types of classes available at my high school, I have come to the conclusion that there are several classes that would be beneficial for my desired career path.

Firstly, I believe that taking a class in computer science would be extremely beneficial for my future career. With the rise of technology, computer science is becoming increasingly important in many industries. Whether I am interested in becoming a software engineer, a data analyst, or a cybersecurity specialist, having a strong foundation in computer science will be essential.

In addition to computer science, I also believe that taking a class in business would be beneficial for my future career. As a student who is interested in entrepreneurship or management, understanding the fundamentals of business will be crucial. This class will teach me how to analyze financial statements, create business plans, and make informed decisions.

Finally, I believe that taking a class in a foreign language would be beneficial for my future career. In today's global economy, being able to communicate effectively with people from different cultures is becoming increasingly important. Whether I am interested in working in international business, diplomacy, or travel, having a strong command of a foreign language will give me a competitive edge.

I have talked to my guidance counselor about these classes, and they have confirmed that they would be beneficial for my desired career path. They have also suggested that I consider taking a class in accounting or marketing, as these skills are also valuable in many industries.

I have realized that you are thinking that students are required to do community service.

What i think you should do is make them do community service. It be a great learning experience. Kids like myself would learn true values of being helpful and also learn respect.

They might not like it at first, but eventually through time they will become better students.

Kids grades might improve by learning true values of respect and education. Every day most kids in about 53.7% don't have good grades and this could make that percentage go down. Just think better grades also means more money for the school.

I think that you should have kids do community service. i know it makes me feel good inside the work itself seeing people smile is the greatest reward of all.

High school is a great place to know people that could help you in the future, and help you to reach your goals also high school is a great place to learn a lot of things and have fun at the same time.

In my opinion, 4 years of high school are better than 3 years because you have more time to study, you are able to have a break during summer, and keep your stress lower.

During this 4 years of school you are able to have enough time to study and prepare for a test, if you have a History test you have time to ask to your History teacher to help you, before or after school to make a review or practice, and get ready for the test. This is one reason why 4 years of school are better then 3 years of school, and you will be able to prepare for your next test also you can have some rest in summer.

In 4 years of school you will have a break during summer, and able to enjoy it with your family or friends doing some activities as going to some parks or museums, and any other different activities that you will like to do, and maybe go back to the school with more energy after summer. This reason also could help you to keep your stress lower when you are in high school.

When you are in high school you can stress a lot because you have to many homework and you need to study for a test, and if you take the 4 years of high you will have a lot of time to study do your homework and keep your stress lower, and during this 4 years you can practice some sports or any activity that you like in your school or outside the school and also this could help you to keep your stress lower. During this process of learning you could find people that are not agree with your opinion and they can say 3 years of school are better then 4 yours of school.

3 years of high school sounds great for some people they want to start working or maybe they think it could be easy but you will not able to enjoy your summer because you have a program to follow during summer, and sometimes you would need to stay after school for study, and you are not able to do the different activities that you like.

I believe you should require students to do community service. You should have students do community service because it is a very good thing to do to help our community. For example, helping clean up trash and waste off our beaches and parks. Also you can rake leaves for your neighbor. Some students think community service is a waste of time and effort. But doing community service can grant you awards, prizes, etc.

Some students say, hey lets go see a movie instead of heading to the park and cleaning up the trash on the ground. What they don't know is not cleaning up trash can effect the environment for animals in a big way. By doing community service you can make a big difference in your life or someone else's. Principal with all do respect if every student in the school did a few hours of community service this can make the school a much better place.

Lots of students perform community service and they are doing a great thing for the community. Other students want to go home and play video games instead of working. Playing video games is not going to help the community. For example, helping the elderly do certain tasks they cant usually do would be a really generous thing to do. Offering community service to anyone would make you fell so good you say ""hey I can do it and I can help anyone who is in need of assistance"".

In paragraph 3 it talks about how the fce is just a natural landfor. Saying it is just a rock formation. Also it says that the shadows just give it the illoution of being a face. Which means the sun has cast shadows on the rocks and the way the rocks were formed it made the shadows fall in the wholes appering to be a face when it really isn't.

In paragraph 7 it says that there is no alien mounuments. Proving most theroy's wrong.

7f125b41,"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become an increasingly popular topic of discussion in recent years, and for good reason. With the negative impact that car emissions have on the environment and the health hazards associated with increased air pollution, it is important to consider the advantages of reducing our reliance on cars. Several articles highlight the benefits of limiting car usage, including ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal and ""The End of Car Culture,"" also by Elisabeth Rosenthal. These articles provide evidence to support the advantages of reducing car usage, such as improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, releasing harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" it is stated that automobiles are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease air pollution and improve the quality of the air we breathe.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and climate change, which have far-reaching consequences for the environment and human health. The article ""The End of Car Culture"" mentions President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions and how a decrease in driving can contribute to achieving these goals. By driving less and finding alternative modes of transportation, such as biking or public transit, we can greatly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable communities. The article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" discusses an experimental new district in Germany called Vauban, where street parking and driveways are forbidden, and car ownership is limited. This community promotes a car-free lifestyle by providing accessible public transportation and placing stores within walking distance. By designing communities that prioritize walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce our dependence on cars and create more sustainable and livable neighborhoods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities. The articles discussed provide evidence to support these advantages and highlight the importance of reducing our reliance on cars. By finding alternative modes of transportation and designing communities that prioritize walking and public transit, we can make significant progress towards a more sustainable future.",1,radek_500,,0

They either put you down or say nothing about what you asked them. They always push you away or ignore you when you need advice on something. In that case, seeking multiple opinions or advice can help someone make a better choice. Three reasons are people might have different opinions about stuff, the person you talk to is busy or you are tired of them putting you down, and you can meet more people or make new friend to for their opinions and advice.

Everyone is different in a way and no one is exactly like one a other. People have different opinions about games, music, drawings, and fashion. Asking other people for their opinions could help you and if you ask for other people's opinions it could raise your self esteem. If you are asking people their opinions you could have multiple resources to get opinions from. You should always ask for other peoples opinions if you are stuck on something so you make a right choice or a better choice than when you just think before doing something.

The person who you might ask for their opinions and they are not there you have no one to ask. They could be busy with talking to someone else or dealing with stuff at home. Let's say your talking to the same person and sometimes they could be negative¬†towards you, that could impact you or upset you. You don't want to tell them how you feels so you ask other people for there opinions about stuff. You could always try and find someone else to ask or just brush off people's negative opinions about you.

Asking for other people's opinions you could meet new people that have will give you their opinions. Meeting new people just means more friends and people who if you ask them to give an opinion¬†they will. For an example your friend's are hanging out with her other people who you don't know all of you could hanging out and get to know each other. After awhile you guys could give each other advice or opinions about any problems you are having at school or at home. Meeting new people could be nervous at first but ending results you end up having a good time after all.

Therefore, seeking multiple choices and opinions isn't that bad has having one opinion for everything. Seeking multiple opinions can help people make better choices. Other people have different opinions and advice depending on what the problem is. The person who you always talk to is busy or you are tired of them always putting you down. You can meet other people or make new friends, they can give you their honest¬†opinions and give you good advice about making the right choices to do better in life or in school.

397E84AEDCB0,"Online classes are causing a worldwide debate. The question standing is can and will students benefit from online classes? Online classes from home has many advantages some of them being that students have limited distractions, it allows students to go at their own pace, and it is very convenient for most. Those who disagree state that it can reduce students work ethic and take them longer to complete simple assignments but that is not true. Although some may disagree, with the option of online classes being available students can benefit academically.

There are a variety of reasons why online classes benefit students. Students can accomplish more complex work. Students no longer will worry about finishing at the same time as others. These scholars will have more time to think and comprehend the task at hand. Online courses are really convenient. If students are sick or out of town they can can still complete their work if necessary. They set aside different times out of the day to do their designated work. Students will face limited distractions with online courses. Some students will not have to worry about loud noises and other students distracting them. Students also are not deterred by the time of the class like they are in regular classes.

There are further reasons why online classes can benefit students. Online courses can improve students self discipline. Students will learn how to manage their time and complete their work in a timely manner. Students face way less intensity when doing online courses at home. Students will not have to go through the struggles of sitting in a lengthy class trying to understand everything that is going on just to have to go to another lengthy class and have to comprehend all the information they learn in there as well.

Online classes have easier access to the instructors. Students can quickly email their teacher a question when they face a problem or have difficulty comprehending the information. Students have more of the teachers attention when taking online courses they don't have to worry about interrupting the instructor teaching or worry about taking someones¬†question.

Although some may disagree online classes can academically benefit students drastically. When taking online courses at home students face less distractions, have more of the teachers time, and greatly improve their self discipline. Those who disagree state that online classes will hinder students learning process and that students will take advantage of this option but that is not true. Online classes are important simply because of the advances students can make with this option being present. This topic is important because students should have the option of doing online courses or in school courses based on whats best academically for them.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
ABFEE879153D,"I believe that graduating high school in three years is the best option out there, the reason why i support this statement is because, i myself i'm graduating early the reason why i decided to this was because, i felt like i was too mature for highschool and i felt like i could do more things that highscool will limit me from doing. So many students see high school as an embergo, high school literally takes four years that alot of time, we could be out there gaining expreinces from being in the workforce and actually studying what we want to do, i also feel like highschool don't really focus on what the students actually want to do, we take classes that we won't even need after high school. Ok let look at it this way, when we take history classes in highschool are kids really going to remember what was George Washington favorite food? or when did the civil war began? yes i know it can be important for us to know our history but we should'nt be taking it for four years non-stop. For example let take a look at bill gates he was a smart kid in highschool, he also use to sneak to the college libary to do his work, because he felt like high school didn't offer him the amount of knowledge he needed so he decided to drop out of high school, and has you can see his on of the top billionairs in the World. What if there is a kid like that in highschool and he/she felt like highschool is not giving him the amount of knowledge he needed and he wants to graduate early but he can't do that because, were required to take four years of everything, and it's totally not fair. When i decided to graduate early, both my counselors and teachers where discouraging me that i should'nt do it, that colleges frown at those type of stuff and all that, but they did'nt know that i already made up my mind and i felt like i was ready to take on the world all by myself without the help of my parents. In conclusion i think three years of highschool should be encouraged alot in highschool, so kids can go out there and explore and live their dreams and actually study what they want to study. And they should'nt really make students take boring courses like history for four years of high shool non stop.

81EB648B5B51,"Distance learning can occur through various means and technologies, but the main purpose is the same across the board. The central focus of distance learning is to allow students to learn even when they cannot be physically present at school. Distance learning has been used before for both long and short periods of time including snow storms, illness, or a mental issue. Although the intentions behind distance learning have just reasoning the widespread implementation of this type of learning would have detrimental¬†effects on students across the country.

Distance learning takes students away from other students their age which not only isolates them, but also hinders their communication and collaboration skills. Many times throughout a school year students are given projects to work on as a group which not only allows for the students to meet new people in their age group, but also allows for them to develop communication skills. These projects typically have some sort of reflection at the end so that the students are able to discuss who in the group put in the most effort which encourages all of the students in the group to try their hardest and collaborate with each other. Part of this collaboration involves working around each others schedules and sacrificing time to check over each others work. Sadly, the skills learned from these projects cannot be learned when utilizing distance learning. Not only are the students unable to meet up in person to discuss their project, but online schools typically shy away from giving group projects due to the difficulty to work around other students schedules. Thus, distance learners are taught to be independent when completing work which can only serve to hinder them when they enter the job force.

Many classes, especially science, complete various different types of labs throughout their course. These can include labs with chemicals, animals, or even virtual labs. The ability to complete these labs not only allows for students to better understand the topic that they are being taught, but also allows for the students to have hands on experience in a safe setting. Unsurprisingly, the same is not true of distance learners. Due to lack of materials, teacher guidance, safety equipment, and a safe area to complete labs distance learners are unable to get the same hands on¬†experience as those physically going to school. This absence of labs hinders the learning ability of the students and retention of the information they are being taught.

However, in extremely serious situations distance learning is able to be beneficiary for students. One of these cases includes the very recent COVID-19, or corona virus. Distance learning, if implemented, will allow for students to remain at home and hopefully away from the virus while still being able to complete their lessons. Not only will this allow for the students to not fall behind on their school work during this period of time, but it will also allow for the school district to not need to add in extra days to the school year. Other cases in which distance learning can and has been implemented is in cases of students contracting mono, having severe eating disorders, or having some form of anxiety. All of these examples allow for a brief period away from school for students to recover before they are able to return again.

Distance learning is a tool that should be utilized by schools only when student(s) are in dire need of time away from school. It should not be utilized as a replacement for school due to its ability to only teach independence, and hinder the collaboration capabilities¬†along with social skills of students. Additionally, distance learning does not allow for students to receive hands on experience or access to laboratories. Despite being effective for short amounts of time, distance learning should not be implemented year round due to its ability to hinder the growth and learning of students and because of its lack of benefit to students not suffering from a mental illness or some form of sickness.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,6
llama_70b_v1368,"Hi, I'm a 6th grader and I want to share my thoughts on whether video games can make people violent.

First, I think it's important to say that video games are really fun and a lot of people like playing them, including me! But, some people think that playing violent video games can make you act violently in real life.

One reason why people might think this is because some violent video games show characters hurting other people or creatures, and this might make players think it's okay to do the same thing in real life. For example, some games let you play as a character who has to kill enemies to win, and this might make some people feel like it's okay to use violence to solve problems.

Another reason why people might think video games can make you violent is because they can be very addicting. If someone spends too much time playing violent video games, they might start to think that it's okay to act violently in real life to get what they want.

However, I don't think that video games can make people violent all by themselves. I think it's important to remember that video games are just games, and they don't have to reflect real life. Just because you play a violent game doesn't mean you'll start acting violently in real life.

Also, there are lots of other factors that can contribute to violent behavior, like if someone is feeling really angry or upset, or if they're around people who are acting violently. It's not just the video games that can make someone violent.

Furthermore, there are also many positive effects of playing video games, such as improving hand-eye coordination, problem-solving skills, and teamwork.

In conclusion, while I understand why some people might think that video games can make you violent, I don't think it's fair to say that video games are the main cause of violent behavior. I think it's important to remember that video games are just games, and that there are many other factors that can contribute to violent behavior.",1,llama_70b_v1,"There is an ongoing debate about the impact of video games on behavior.

12FEB57ECB4E,"Students should be able to choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities or not for many reasons. Most students are busy and don't want added pressure on top of school work. While kids may want to do extraculliculars they may do out of school activities that can take up their time, or they might have a family to take care of. Many students also a lot of time for homework, which they won't get the time for in an extracurricular.

A reason students student's may not want to do an extracurricular is because they might have out of school obligations. If a student was babysitting or tutoring someone, they wouldn't have time to do extraculliculars because they'd be busy doing another job. It would be unfair to force someone who has another job to do more work, which is why they should have the choice to do an extracurricular activity.

Furthermore, some students could have a family to take care of when they get home. For example, if a student has a younger sibling that needs to be picked up from the bus stop, the student would have to help with that. If they were forced to do an extracurricular, they wouldn't have time to take care of their sibling.

In addition, quite a few students would need more time to do homework, which an extracurricular would prevent them from doing. While some students can finish their homework quickly and have enough time for another activity, a student who takes a long time shouldn't be rushed into doing something else. If they need more time to do their homework, they shouldn't be dragged into doing an activity.

In conclusion, students have out of school activities, family to take care of, and a lot of homework which can make it hard for them to focus on extracurricular activities on top of it. All in all, there are many reasons a student might not want to do an extracurricular. Because of this, a student should be able to have a choice to do another activity or not.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
B7E89307EDCB,"Dear Principal.

I support policy 1 students should be able to bring cell phones to school and use them during free time. The reason i support this is there could be an accident at school and school phones aren't working, the student may stay after school and need a ride too get home, and finally the student may have a medical condition that is not on file. these are the reasons I support policy 1.

The 1st reason I support policy 1 is there could be an accident at school. There could be an attack at the school and the culprit moves all the teachers away from there phones. Who are they going too depend on? The students who have cell phones too call law enforcement.

the student that does have a cell phone could call and stop precious lives from being lost.

The second reason I support the 1st policy is the student may need a ride too and from school. picture this, it's late after every one has left the building and went home accept one kid who doesn't have a cell phone. He may have too walk home alone and could possible be endangered by some of the crazy people that we unfortunately have in this world. It could be your kid, it could be a student like me.

The third and final reason I support policy 1 is there could be a student with a medical condition that is not on file. imagine there being a student that suddenly began too have a seizure. your afraid and you cant get in contact with the mother and don't know the fathers number you could simple pull the students phone out go into there contacts and call the parents again or call another gradin of the student. You wouldn't want this too happen and probably believe this wont happen but accidents do happen.

EBE0730AFF0E,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student on the topic of Winston Churchill's quote ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.""

Hey, guys, today we're gonna talk about this really cool quote by Winston Churchill. He was like, super smart and important, and he said that success isn't forever, and failing isn't the end of the world. And I think that's really true!

So, let's talk about why failing is actually kinda important. Like, think about it, if you never failed, you wouldn't learn anything new! You wouldn't know what you're good at, or what you're not good at. And you definitely wouldn't know how to improve. It's like, if you never tried to climb a mountain, you wouldn't know how to get to the top!

But, on the other hand, sometimes failing can be really frustrating and make you wanna give up. Like, what's the point of even trying if you're just gonna fail anyway? And it can be hard to keep going when you keep failing over and over again. But, you know what? That's when you gotta be brave and keep going!

I mean, think about it, like, if Thomas Edison had given up on inventing the light bulb after the first few tries, we would never have had electricity! And if Leonardo da Vinci had given up on painting the Mona Lisa after the first few tries, we would never have had one of the most famous paintings of all time! See, failure is not the end of the world, it's just a chance to try again and do better!

So, my argument is that you shouldn't lose enthusiasm after failing multiple times. Like, yeah, it might be hard, but you gotta keep going! And if you keep trying, you might just surprise yourself and succeed! And even if you don't, you'll still learn something new and be a better person because of it.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill was right, success is not final, and failure is not fatal. It's the courage to continue",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

EA8B2F944034,"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle, because it can be distracting. You should not use any mobile device, while you're driving because that can cause a very bad accident. It's the majority of teenagers that feel like they can use a cellular device while they're on the road. It doesn't matter if you're talking on the phone or texting while driving, it can distract you from paying attention to the road. None of that doesn't matter at that moment, because you could end up losing your life. In this essay, I will be stating the causes, the consequences, and how to prevent others from texting and driving or talking on the phone while they're driving.

There are many dangerous effects of texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving. Well, one danger while texting and driving is people can become distracted and can cause an accident. Another danger while you are driving and texting or talking on the phone is you can hit a pedestrian. Our brains are incapable of giving our attention to more than one activity at a time. So, this means when you are driving and talking on the phone, you're actually splitting your attention between at least two activities. That's why laws were made to prohibit texting and talking while driving.

If you break the law, there are consequences for texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving. The consequences of texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving is that you can get a monetary fine, which can be up to $500, depending on what state you're in. You could also get criminal charges for texting and driving or talking on the phone while you're driving. One of the worst things that could happen is that you could go to jail or prison. This is a very dangerous situation, because you could actually lose your life or take somebody else's life while texting and driving or talking on the phone while you're driving.

There are many ways to prevent others from texting and driving or talking on the phone while driving. Well, one way to prevent others from texting and driving or talking on the phone while driving is to keep your phone out of reach. Blocking incoming texts or calls is another way to prevent you from texting and talking while you're driving. If you just have to talk, pull over and stop if it's very important, if it's not important, just keep your phone out of sight.

Texting while driving is a big issue. People do it everyday, but they don't realize that their lives are in danger and so are others on the road. There are a lot of people dying each and every day, because of phone usage car accidents. Leave the phone alone while you are driving, because a text is not worth a life. That text will be there when you get to your destination. Don't choose to pick up the phone while you're on the road. It's very dangerous, even if it's just talking on the phone for one second.

So therefore, be very cautious of what you do with your phone while you're on the road!                                                               ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

49F934497799,"As technology has advanced in the last 20 years, more and more opportunities are being given to students with different needs than others. Students who must stay in hospitals, or have physical disabilities have the option to take online classes. Now that online classes have become accepted by public school systems, many kids believe that these classes will fit them best. However, these distance learning options may not be as effective as regular classes. Online classes create an environment of distractions, can lead to poor work ethics, and have little to no interaction between students.

Students who take online classes at home are very susceptible to distraction. In normal school classes, students are required to put their cellphones away. At home, there is no such regulation. No matter how much attention a student places on their lessons, their cellphone will be a constant presence, with notifications going off every few minutes. Distractions can also come in the form of parents who do not have work, or siblings who do not have school. Students who take online classes can simply walk away from their lessons, and go hang out with their siblings. Overbearing parents who check to make sure their child is continuing their lessons can disrupt the flow of learning that many students enter. While taking classes at home might appear to benefit some students, the distractions that being at home provides can hurt the intake of knowledge that students require.

Online classes can also lead to poor work ethics by students taking them. In regular classes, the looming presence of a teacher motivates many students to try their best. For students who take online classes, there is no physical presence that regulates their classwork. The absence of this pressure can lead to students who willingly put the least amount of effort into their work. Being at home during class can also create a dissociation between the work and it's importance. Taking tests or quizzes in familiar environments can lower stress levels, which can be beneficial, but can also convince students they do not need to try as hard. Students may choose not to study for important tests just because they do not feel as pressured to do well. Online classwork can often be found through the internet, or answers can easily be sent by other classmates. Students who do not use homework to their advantage as a studying tool will often be left unprepared for tests and quizzes because they did not actually do their work. Students of online classes are very susceptible to the deterioration of work ethic, which can harm them in the short-term, as well as long-term.

Interaction between students who take online classes is very low. Collaboration between students is a key part of normal classrooms. Students who feel afraid to ask their teachers can rely on other students sitting near them to answer their questions. With online classes, there is no face-to-face interaction between students at all, and explanations sent through text messages can often be confusing or not helpful at all. Being in a class with other students can also create a competitive environment, which can often be beneficial to the learning space. Students who take online classes feel no pressure to do any better than their classmates, as they have no interaction with them. Their is also a social benefit to being in classes with other people, as it teaches students how to act appropriately with others, and how to handle group interaction in future jobs. Online classes do not allow for students to develop these soft skills that can help their current classwork, and their future careers. While many may argue that the group assignments that some online classes have, the interactions between students that online assignments create are very limited to interaction through text messages, and not face-to-face. Online classes are devoid of the interaction and competition of physical classes.

In conclusion, distance learning options may not be as effective as they appear. Taking classes at home can create distractions, such as cellphones and family members interrupting learning. Online classes can encourage students to develop poor work ethics, feeling little pressure to do well or use their resources to their advantage. The lack of student interaction in online classes creates an environment deprived of collaboration and competition. The ultimate goal of education systems should be to match the needs of each individual student. However, as distance learning exists in it's current form, students without special needs should not take online classes.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
EDDAE2D4080B,"English as a Second Language (ESL) programs have become increasingly popular in schools around the world as more and more students are learning English as their second language. These programs are designed to help students who are not native English speakers to improve their language skills and become more proficient in English.

One of the main benefits of ESL programs is that they provide students with the opportunity to practice their English skills in a structured and supportive environment. These programs typically include a variety of activities and exercises that are designed to improve vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and other language skills. Students are often paired with native English speakers who act as language partners, allowing them to practice their conversational skills and gain confidence in their ability to speak English.

ESL programs also provide students with the opportunity to learn about the culture and customs of the country where they are studying. This can be especially helpful for students who are planning to study or work in an English-speaking country in the future. By learning about the culture and customs of the country, students can better understand and appreciate the language and its role in the community.

In addition to the benefits for the students, ESL programs can also have a positive impact on the school community as a whole. By providing students with the opportunity to learn English, schools can help to foster a more diverse and inclusive community. This can be especially important in today's globalized world, where it is increasingly important for students to be able to communicate with people from different backgrounds and cultures.

Overall, ESL programs are an important tool for schools to help students improve their English skills and become more proficient in the language.

683A4FE3661C,"First impressions are incredibly important in the formation of relationships and opinions of people and events. They can shape the way we view the people, places, and cultures around us. Throughout my life, I have both experienced and seen first impressions that are hard to overcome. For example, I remember going to a new school and having my first impressions of the other students being based on what they wore, the things they said, and their general attitude towards the other students. Sadly, these initial, often inaccurate, impressions would remain with me for some time. 

Incidentally, this is backed up by research which suggests that first impressions are made quickly, often in less than a few seconds, and are difficult to later change. It's even been shown that first impressions are made primarily using visual cues such as clothing, hairstyles, body language, and facial expressions. While some first impressions are accurate in predicting how people will behave, many times they are not, which is why it's so important to be aware of them. 

By being aware of first impressions, we can make sure that we don't unnecessarily limit our relationships and interactions with other people based on these first impressions. It's also important to remember that first impressions are not always accurate, and making snap judgments about someone could lead to misdirected opinions and misunderstandings of the person in question.

Car usage limitations allow the citizens to feel less stressed, show a decrease in air pollution and a promotion towards alternative transportation, and a decrease in habit.

The article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" (Source One), suburban pioneers have decided to permently give up cars. Although the usage of cars are generally forbidden in Vauban, its fellow citizens express that they were ""always tense... [are] much happier this way"" without the use of a car in their lives. When individuals are stressed, they're constantly worrying and not fully paying attention to surroundings; therefore, stress is considered one of the causes of vehicle crashes. Also, the congestion of traffic (if not awful enough already) will become worse with the crash which causes more individuals to become stressedl. Without the use of cars, citizens are less stressed and can go about their daily lives. Vauban is considered to be ""the most advanced experiment in low-car suburband life"" because of the attempt to make the city denser and a better place for walking has succeed.

""Paris bans driving due to smog"" (Source Two), mainly focuses on the environmental issues that car usage has been causing throughout the city. After a near-record, pollution, Paris strictly enforced a driving ban to ""clear the air of the global city"". The smog from the motorized vehicles is hazardous to our environment which therefore can be damaging to us and our bodies if we only inhale smog. Therefore, health problems are presented among the population and causes an endless loop of health concerns to be dealt with. These can be considered ""solved"" if the environmental issues are presented and dealt with immediately and effectively. Luckily, with Paris going in the right direction with the ban, health concerns will decrease as well as the smog in the air. Because of the ban that Paris has plaaced, congestion was ""down 60 percent in the capital of France"". Presented later, the smog in the city has began to clear enough. Two beneficial causes have been brought forth all because of limitations on the usage of cars.

""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" (Source Three),¬† explains how Bogota has a dedication day to the use without cars. According to a business man, Carlos Arturo, he explains how the day of dedication relieves stress and lowers the pollution. In order to transport oneself from place to place, citizens can walk or ride bicycles. Because of the large impact that Bogota has made, ""municipal authorites from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic"". In summary, this city has made quite an influencial mark on others. With prediction, this event could end up carrying throughout the world because of the incredible benefit that it has on our planet: the decrease of air pollution. It not only helps us, but it provides help to the world. Another article, ""The End of Car Culture"" (Source 4), explains that a study has been made on the American drivers: ""... are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". If this pattern continues, it'll provide implications for carbon emissions and the environment, seeing as ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"". If we could reduce this, our lives and breathing conditions can be improved dramatically. The quote, ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit"", means that if we can break the habit of buying cars, there will be no more habit to continue with.

In conclusion, the reduction and limitations of car usage will not only be beneficial to us, but it'll become greatly beneficial to our environment; which becomes an endless loop of helping one another out.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Which is a great thing, because it motivates citizens to provide new ways to get around, such as walking or riding a bike; and it provides the area with freasher air to breath. France's actions caught the attention Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world.

Another significant reason why decreasing the use of cars is a great thing, is because it allows citizens to interact with each other; and to promote alternative transportations to travel around the city. In passage 3, it states that millions of columbians, in Bogota, Coulumbia partake in a car free day, which they hope will inspire others all around to do the same. The citizens of columbia used more effiecient ways to travel around the city such as, hiking, biking, or skating. It provided them a great exercise, reduced stress and air pollution, and a chance to interact with their community and environment. Columbia's event recieved a great deal attention and widely influenced other countries and cities all over the world.

Although, automobiles provide an easier, faster way to get around it is the cause of toxic pollution in the air. So limiting car usauge will provide fellow citizens with a healthier lifestyle and freasher air. One small step to decrease pollution could spark a revolutionary change.       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
0FA4341980D4,"In 1976, the spacecraft Viking 1 took a photo of a certain area on Mars. When NASA saw the photo, they saw what looked like a face. However, many years later, the Face turned out to be a natural formation, like a mesa is on Earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said that it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This proves that the Face is not an alien artifact. Also, NASA has found no other evidence of alien life on Mars, so the chances that the Face is made by aliens go down even more. Some people still believe that this Face has something do to with aliens. Conspiracy theorists say that NASA is hiding evidence from us, and that they don't want us to know about aliens on Mars. This theory is also disproved. Jim Garvin said that it's hard work to get photographs of the area, so why would NASA work so hard to get pictures of the Face if they wanted to hide it? Furthermore, NASA would love to find an ancient alien civilization, and would probably share it if they did find something. Finally, there is one more piece of evidence that the Face wasn't made by aliens. There are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face. I would give an example but I cant do any research because this is a test. The reasons above prove that the landform on Mars known as the Face, is NOT made by aliens.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
C7F9CF7196EC,"Dear Principal:

I truly understand you on this policy, there is many reasons why this policy should be considered. Many students love sport willing to do anything to get in the sport team. By this, I'm saying that if they have low grades they will have to try harder to get in the sport. This will not only improve there grade but will help them get higher test scores.

Many students at my school love sports and are always talking about it. Now this means that they will do whatever is possible to get in the sport which as a result they have to have higher grades. If all students are in a sport and have good grades they will be able to have a good collage application.

On the other hand many people may think that a sport is a good way to keep a student healthy and active. But if this police it given not only will they be healthy but be motivative to keep their grades higher. This will help then throw out the school year.

I am very appreciated of you for taking time out of your day to read my letter. If you have any questions or comments feel free to send a letter or a call. this will defiantly be a good police in consideration. Again thank you so much!",0,persuade_corpus,,9
AFFCB27334C9,"Thomas Jefferson's quote ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.""

Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, is known for his wisdom and insightful quotes. One such quote that stands out is ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote emphasizes the importance of staying active and avoiding idleness in order to achieve great things.

As an eighth-grader, I understand the importance of staying active and not being bored. There are many ways to stay active, such as participating in sports, joining a club or team, or even volunteering in the community. These activities not only keep us physically active, but also mentally stimulated and engaged.

In addition to staying active, going to the gym has numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. Exercise helps to improve cardiovascular health, build muscle and bone strength, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Furthermore, going to the gym can also improve mood and reduce stress levels.

Another great way to stay active is by going for walks. Walking is a low-impact exercise that can be done anywhere, at any time. It is a great way to get some fresh air, clear the mind, and enjoy the natural surroundings. Walking has also been shown to improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

Finally, getting a job can also be a great way to stay active and engaged. Working provides a sense of purpose and accomplishment, as well as the opportunity to learn new skills and meet new people. It can also provide a source of income, which can be used to pursue other interests and activities.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson's quote ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" emphasizes the importance of staying active and avoiding idleness. There are many ways to stay active, such as participating in sports, joining a club or team, or even volunteering in the community.

Some students think that they are waste time in four years in high school. In my opinion is a good idea to finish high school in three years, because the students can take class before school or after school, then, they can graduate in three years instead four years, instead elective courses, the students can take class, they need for graduate, and the students will have more time to go to college.

The students can take class before school or after school, and they can graduate in three years instead four years. The students can come one hour early, before school start, and they can take class every day of school, or they can stay one hour after school to take the class. However, some students think that is tired to come early to the school, or stay after school.

Instead elective courses, the students can take classes, that they need for graduate. The students can use the time, that they uses for the elective courses, they can use it for the classes they need for graduate. The elective courses it does not prepare to the students for college, and the regular classes prepare them for college.

However, some students think, they need four years in high school for to be very prepare for college. The students will have time to think, which college they want to go.

I believe that is better finish college in three yeras, because the students get more time to go to college, so, when they finish their career. Then, they can study another career, because they will still young. If, the students stay four years in high school, they will not have enough time to study two careers.

The mall, grocery store, movies all a small walking distance away. That would be great right? You'd be helping yourself and the world by making you fit and the world's pollution decrees. That sound interesting I feel like the world is slowly coming to a stopping point with car use.

A world with cleaner air is what we would have if everyone limited the use of their cars. According to "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal "" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states."" The United States produces a greater amount of greenhouse gasses. If we limited the use of our cars the United States would have better air making the United States a better place to live. The United States has a very large number of people already pulling away from using cars. According to "" The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal."" Americans are buying fewer cars,driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Cars are not needed for everyday use because people seem to get around greatly.

Limiting the use of you care can greatly help everyone. The United States has a very large amount of unhealthy people. People who don't get to walk or do fitness regularly to be able to stay healthy and fit. Having limited the use of your car it would as help you mentally. In the article ""In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal Heidrun Walter a mother of two says "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" If a mother of two says that not using her car makes her happier. In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" by Andrew selsky a businessman said "" It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution."" So if you ask me the would would be better without using cars everyday it's a win win situation.

People all around the world are taking part in limiting the use of cars. People from Colombia to Pairs to Germany. People all over the word are all trying to help out the world by limiting the use of cars. In the article "" Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky the author talks about how everyone took a ""car free"" This was Bogota's third straight year of no car day the only cars that were allowed to be on the road were those of busies or taxis. The violators that drove their car are faced with a fine of $25. In the text of ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. She says that the worlds car culture is slowly coming to a end fewer people are getting their licenses and more are organizing their social lives and summer jobs around where they could was or take a buss to.

The world is on a better path with people trying to limit the use of their cars. The world gets better and so do you. In the articel ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" by Andrew Selsky says that the business in the small town have also boomed "" Parks and sports centers also have boomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restraints and up scale shopping districts have cropped up.""

52F671887530,"Dear Senator:

Over the years, people have been disputing over the Electoral College. Some people want it abolished while others want it to stay. The Electoral College is not working and and it needs to be abolished. For many reasons, the Electoral College has not worked. It is unfair to the voters, it causes voters to not vote, and it is unfair to the candidates.

The Electoral College is unfair to the voters. According to source 2, :""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" The whole point of voting is so that you, along with many people, can decide who will be the next president! Voting for people to elect a president is just not right. It causes voters to not vote because they know that their vote really won't matter. Source 2 also states that candidates don't spend time in small states, ""focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" That is causing smaller states like Rhode Island and South Carolina to have less knowledge on the candidates. If I didn't know too much about a candidate, I wouldn't vote at all! Even though people in those states did vote, they might not have known a lot about the candidates and voted for the wrong person.

The people running for office want to win. Source 3 says that someone could have a higher popular vote but lose the election. Is that fair to the candidate? Winning the popular vote but losing the election? No, it isn't. Winning the popular vote means that more people want you in office. If the majority of America wants a certain person to be the president of their country, that means that the winner of the election would be the majority vote. The Electoral College denys that basic right of Americans by not letting them choose their president. That alone is unfair to the candidates and to the voters.

Now you might be saying that the Electoral College has worked for a very long time and shouldn't be changed. Although the Electoral College has been working for a long time, that is the only thing that America has tried. If America used the popular vote, it could've changed elections. The Electoral College hasn't been working because it is causing more and more voters to stop voting and it is making it where only the majority vote doesn't matter. Citizens of America should have the right to chose the president by majority vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is unfair to the voters, it causes voters to not vote, and it is unfair to the candidates. As an American citizen, you have the right to vote. The Electoral College is taking that away and it needs to be stopped.

We should keep the electoral college because we want the people to vote not the house. If the people dont vote how would we know if we are getting what we deserve. Also as the artcle states ""the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president"". The people should be able to vote because if we dont we are not going to be happy that we didnt get a say in the election.

The article states the that the eletoral college consist of 538 electors but only a majority of 270 electoral votes is required. Where is the 300 hundred and somthing other votes do they not get counted or do you forget about them because i think that is unreasonable becaues we have more people voting. The article states that ""most states have a ""winner takes all"" i think that this is basically cheating because you should only get what you have. If you get more than what you elected for the other people that you get will possiably turn against you thats why you should only get the people you already have.

If we let the people votes for who they may want then we would also be helping out the house to deside on who is president. For the people that like politics would like to vote but yes i know that some people arent going to vote,but we should still give are people a chace to vote. in this case i would like to have the electoral college to stay but let the people speak too.

7F4706C105DE,"Failure: The Unspoken Path to Success

As an 8th grader, I've experienced my fair share of failures. Whether it's bombing a math test or struggling to make friends, failure can be a tough pill to swallow. But what if I told you that failure is not just a setback, but a necessary step towards success? It may sound counterintuitive, but think about it ‚Äì every successful person has experienced failure at some point in their journey.

Take Thomas Edison, for example. He's famous for inventing the light bulb, but what most people don't know is that he failed over a thousand times before finally succeeding. That's right, he failed more than he succeeded! But he didn't let those failures discourage him. Instead, he used them as opportunities to learn and improve. And in the end, his persistence paid off.

The same goes for me. I've always struggled with public speaking, but I knew I had to push through my fears if I wanted to improve. So, I joined the school debate team, even though I was terrified of speaking in front of a crowd. And guess what? I bombed my first few speeches! But I didn't give up. I kept practicing, and with each speech, I got better and better. Now, I'm not the best speaker in the world, but I'm definitely not as nervous as I used to be.

The point is, failure is not something to be ashamed of. It's a natural part of the learning process. Every time we fail, we learn something new, whether it's a new skill or a new way of thinking. And those lessons can help us in the long run, even if we don't realize it at the time.

So, the next time you're feeling discouraged by a failure, remember Thomas Edison and me. We didn't let our failures hold us back. Instead, we used them as stepping stones towards success. And who knows ‚Äì maybe one day, you'll be the one inspiring others with your own story of perseverance and determination.

In conclusion, failure is not something to be feared or avoided. It's an essential part",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Write an essay exploring the concept of failure as a necessary step towards success, using your own personal experience and examples of successful figures as evidence for your argument.",2

In argumentive situation everyone has there own opinions. But with somethings it makes no sense what they're trying to prove. if i was in an argument with someone who thought there was life on the planet Mars i would try to prove how. In space its hard to say theres life in space because scientist have no proof ,no data, or evidence there could be. For there to be a face on mars is hard to believe and for an alien to make it no evidence adds up.

No one really had an exact reaction to the face because all they were assuming there is life on mars. The public started saying theres aliens up there. But the size of the head was two miles and contiued to stare back at everyone. But some people were realistic saying that their was another Martian mesa they were common around cydonia but this image made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. So none of the scientist put alot of thought into it but its the people who escalted the theory and image.

The people who thought there was life the rock formation of how it looked gave an illusion of a head, nose, eyes,and a mouth. The public was so dedicated to proving there was and they could prove it. But some other people and scientist were explaining that there is no life. The more people started talking and hearing about it became a bit more fake and hard to believe. This theory of the face started becoming in Hollywood flms, books, magazines and just made up stories.

Nasa begun to get frusterated and there budget started decreasing. Nasa actually wished it was acient civilizationon mars instead. Scientist started blieving that the face was alien artifact. So they started photographing Cydonia as i priority. When they started photographing more and more they were sorta getting somewhere. But they finally sent out Mars Global Surveyors and flew obver to Cydonia and they took a picture. The picture was ten times better and sharper than the original photos they had with the viking.

Nasa tried to get alot more photos and were gettiing no where becuase of the main reason the weather. But on April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia go a perfect view of the face. Soon Nasa made a conclusion the picture actually looked like the Martian Equivalent. A butte or messa they were landforms common around the American West. Scientist they can finally put an end to the rumor saying theres life over there. Now everyone can know the actual truth with with this whole conspericy.

Getting to an argument with someone about is ther life on mars. Or is there really a face on mars. But i think the argument is clear who would be right. There's just to much evidence proving theres no and what they saw is an illusion of a face. Sometimes you just need proof to an easy fact of what is hard to figure out.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
4A7D8E9EE8FC,"Gaining vast information and knowlege on the planet of Venus would be worth the dangers it pourtreys, because it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author explains that Venus is very valuable planet to scientists and NACA, even though all previous missions for exploring it have not lasted for no more than a few hours. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system""(4). So it is very important to gain more information and data on such a unquie planet. By gaining information on Venus we may learn more about our own planet, Earth, which is worth the dangers exploring it presents.

While scientists and Astronomers would gain vast data and information if they were to explore Venus up close, exploring it is not an easy task. In the article it states that ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no scapecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (2). Also it exclaimed that the ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"" and ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"" (3). So it is very hard and dangous to send any kind of big technology to Venus, without it getting destroyed; let alone sending a human and explecting them to make it out alive. Even if we were able to send a probe to Venus, the article explains that ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes"" (3). While there are thousands of reasons for NACA scientists to give up on finding information on the planet of Venus, they still are trying new ways to make it up there, despite the dangers.

Scientists find it crucial to continue in their research, for several reasons. The main reason is becuase, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"" (2). Which makes it important to use Venus to learn more about our own planet. ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"",which is one of the reasons it is so earth like (4). Also it is important to learn more about Venus becuase we currently contain little knowlege about Venus becuase ""researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"" (6). For these reasons it is important for NACA and other scientists across the world to continue to try and gain a more vast arae of information.

In conclution, while Venus has presented many obsticles for scientists to get around, they find the prize of great value. Although Venus is extremly hard to explore because of its ruff teraine and extreme temperatures. Scientists find it to be of great value because of its Earth like appeal and its unknown information. Therefore, scientists and NACA will continue to atempt to gain more data on the planet of Venous despite the dificulties.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

For one, asking multiple people can give you different perspectives about it. Secondly, some advice can be really bad so you'll need to seek for more that will give you success. Lastly, It's better to look for more options when trying to make the right choice. All in all, asking more than one person can lead to a big success.

First of all, making the right choices comes in many different ways. Getting more than one point of view is going to allow you to see what other people think. Seeing how other people think might change you. Everyone has different views on everything, so asking three people gives you three different answers. Making the right choice is hard, but if you get different perspectives things will get easier.

Secondly, some people might not give you great advice. Everyone's advice is different because everyone's different. Not all advice is going to be the same or perfect. Going out and only asking one person for advice isn't a great idea and this is why. One person, is a piece of advice and it could be bad or good, but if you ask more than one person you have multiple to choose from.

Lastly, searching for more options is always the right choice. Having only one option can hurt you. If you had only one option for everything in the world we'd all be dead. Having more than one option can lead you to bigger and better things such as, being a hero, making the right choices, helping people out, and finally saving lives.

falcon_180b_v1_1042,"I think that animals should not be used in scientific research at all. It is wrong to use them for our benefit, especially when it harms them physically and mentally. We should respect animals and treat them with kindness.

One of the main reasons why I believe animals should not be used in scientific research is because it is cruel. For instance, animals are often forced to eat or inhale chemicals, which can make them sick or even kill them. Moreover, they are often kept in tiny cages for long periods of time, which can cause them to become depressed or anxious.

Animals also have rights, and we have a moral responsibility to protect them from harm. It is unfair to use them for our benefit without consent. They cannot speak up for themselves, so it is up to us to be their advocates.

Finally, there are alternative methods to animal testing that can be used. For example, computer modeling and in-vitro testing can provide accurate results without the use of animals. These methods are more humane and can also save money.

In conclusion, we should not use animals in scientific research because it is cruel and violates their rights.

In times of a tough decision, seeking multiple opinions will help in making a better choice. Everyones opinion¬†gives a different point of view and can help pick out what decision is best. As well as, some people have gone through similar things and can help talk out the situation.¬†In my lifetime I have experienced my friend go through a rough path. Because of the people who helped her, she is now happier and living much better.

Many people will have different perspectives. They all can influence a decision, because everyone is¬†different. We are raised by our culture and environment. Therefore, no two minds are alike. Situations are seen differently, giving an abundance of different solutions. Imagine a parent and friend helping out the same person, now compare the two. As a parent they want what's best for their child and try to look to steer them in the right direction. While a friend may want the same thing, but at the end of the day they are looking to have fun and may not always give the best advice. When people are getting someone else's a opinion they are making themselves vulnerable to the fact that different possibilities could happen. People can get strongly judged or rejected on their opinions they've made, as that could heavily impact a choice. However, getting multiple views on a decision is always the best option, because everyone sees things differently.

Throughout our life people have been through hardships. Some may be similar situations which include ways it's been dealt with in hopes of others making better choices. With the help of someones past, it can help pave a way for someones decision. Knowing peoples mistakes and consequences can differ what others choose to do. When making a choice some people visit professionals. A few include psychologists, therapists and counselors, they help listen to a problem in hopes of breaking it down and seeking best possible outcomes. These people are there to help drive a path for healthy decision making. Another reason is that knowing other people struggle with things too and that no one is ever alone. It provides at least a little comfort understanding everyone goes through something. Those people who decide to open up about their problems can also help determine a choice. Most people care for the well-being of people in hopes for a successful and enjoyable life. Talking to people who have dealt with similar problems or people who are professionally trained, can help bring ease to making a decision.

At one point in life everyone has gone through or knows someone who has been through a tough decision. A couple years ago I had a friend who always gave advice to everyone's¬†problems. She was beautiful, intelligent and fun to be around. However, she did not feel this way about herself. As time went on some situations became too heavy to handle, the stress grew on top of her. At school she only showed perkiness, meanwhile, she was in a darker place. No one was aware of this until a few weeks later when she spoke to her friends, then counselors, next teachers and eventually her parents to get the help she wanted. She was afraid of what the world would think of her if she wasn't perfect. These people all helped her find ways for comfort and how to get the treatment needed without doing something harmful to herself or others. She was steered back into a safe and happy pathway thanks to the help of those around her.

To finish off, when seeking multiple opinions it can help someone make a better choice. As said in paragraph one, throughout life people have different views on situations and how to resolve them beneficially. As restated in paragraph two, people in life are faced with many challenges. Knowing others struggle can help bring together different ways to handle a decision. Lastly, when my peer was faced with a problem she sought out help, this brought her to a happier place. She is now better than she ever thought she could be. Making a decision shouldn't be done alone, we need to use the people around us to help guide our journey.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
BF9ACEA631D8,"The majority of people expect is the best way students can learn is going to the school than attend¬†classes from home, when they are taking classes online from home sometimes they never look at it or never do the work, because nobody is telling him to do the work or go to learn. If the students go to the school and they don't work, teacher can call their parents and tell as about their child.

Sometimes students need help with someting like if they don't understand or they have a lot of work, teacher can teach again and again and if the boy or girl can't get it the teacher can teach in other way, the other students can help or helping each other, also if the teacher give a lot of work students can have a partner to share the work and that way can be more easy to have the work done.

If the parents want to know if their kids are learning in school, they can ask in the school how their kids going in each classes, the teacher can send an e-mail to each parents to know his or her grades, if he need more help to learn and with that the parents can know if they are learning or not, and also the school can call the parents if their child are not going to the class and talk with their child what happen.

The parents can feel more confidents because they child are learning, teacher can teach more better than have online classes at home, they can receive more help because the teacher are their for anything they needs. And some schools has eagle block for students who need help with one class or they need more time to study. They can get textbooks and look in classe with that.

But some people like more their kids receive classes at home, some parents like mom or dad can stay at home and watch if they are learning or not, their are some classes online with more information than school has, they can watch video conferencing because they can explain more clearly.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

Hes knows this is a great risk but he still believes it could be done by a man and also thinks it would be worth it by acomplishing it.

An explanation of the evidence is when the text says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should nit be limted by dangers and doubts but shoukd be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"".

43E0966DA634,"In this life i think that there should be a limited amount of car usage. For the simple fact that gas is bad for the earth. In many way to some people this may be untrue. But I think that the limited amount of car usage would be great for the earth. My reason being is that car's make people excersize less, causes smog , bad for the enviroment.

To begin with, i think that limited amount of car usage is good for lazy people. I mean people will waste gas just to drive 3 minutes to a store when you could walk to save gas. It really makes no sense that a average person could be so lazy. You can be doing two good things at one time. By just walking for your health and saving up on gas,The text says,""Many experts expect public transport serving suburs to play a much larger role.

Next, I think it is a good idea because it wont cause so much smog which is a bad thing for the air. According to the text,""Paris has banned driving due to smog Paris enforced a partial driving bad to clear the air of the global city"". The last thingwe need to do is be breathing in dirty air and pretty much gas. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. Twenty seven people had there cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

Also, My final reason is that it is bad for the enviroment. Luckily The text says,""President Obama's ambitious goals to curn the united states"". Its about time some one point out the wrong honestly in my opnion if i was president i would ban driving to unless your like traveling to a far out state or your work is really far. I think that is should not be allowed.

So to sum it all up, I think that a limited amount of car usage would be good for the enviroment. And have a good impact on the world. Once again my reasons for it is that make's people excersize less, causes smog , bad for the enviroment. So my fellow citizens think about what you are doing to the world and how it not only effects us but how it also effects you.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
9926ba6f,"Cars are benefits for getting you from point A to point B, but there are many other ways you can receive transportation that way. Cars can also get you there quicker, but its not worth what we are doing to our environment and ourselves. There are three major advantages about limiting your car use. It will help out our environment with the air pollution you can hear the peacefulness of birds and kids playing, and its a financial rest.

First and foremost, it will help out with our air pollution. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...""14. The gas we use to fuel up our vehicles is polluting the environment when we use it. If we used Paris as an example, we can have odd and even driving days for odd and even license plates 11. That means only half the people with cars would be driving on the road each day which could alter the air pollution. Another reliable example is Bogota, once a year they have a car free day to limit the air pollution 20. Carlos Arturo Plaza believes, ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" 24.

In addition, the neighborhood or city you are in wouldn't be as loud. Have you ever imagined a peaceful environment with no car horns or engine? Heidrun Walter said she was always tense and now she is happy without her car, because she can hear the swiss of bicycles and the chatterring of children playing 3. Rarely do I ever have peaceful moments unless I'm inside school, or at the neighborhood library. For example, a peaceful walk to school can mentally prepare me for my day ahead, and save my mother gas money.

The amount of money one pays for a car could be equilvalent to amount some else pays for their house. Also, when you get the car, you have to put gas in it for your engine to power up. Limited car use wouldn't just effect you as a person, but the economy as a whole. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport"" 9. If we reduced our car usage, the United States wouldn't have to spend 80 percent of appropriations to highways and they could even it out more to other transportation use. Plus, if you didn't have to pay for gas every week just imagine how much money that would save you.

Limited car use doesn't just effect you financially, but it also contributes positively to the environment. In additon, more peaceful moments can be added to your agenda of things to do. Cars are reliable for their speed and transportation, but when it comes to long term effects, I don't know if its really worth the risk.",0,train_essays,,7
332FDA404A85,"I don't like the idea of driveless cars. I feel like if a human can do it we should. Especially when it comes to things like that. like the idea of robots, would you really want something cleaning for you and taking care of older folks and children. I do think they are a good idea for the blind and people not going to far. Like since i live in Indiana, they would be a good idea for people in Indianapolis to get from the mall to like a resturant or something. Nothing major or far like driving from Indiana to California, not a good idea. I just don't trust things like that.

Driveless cars are sort of a good idea. they're are many pros and cons about the whole thing. I feel like they are dangerous because they could malfuncting and blow up or something. Or they will drive right into a buliding at full speed or something. No car is really safe in general, but letting a robot like thing drive your car is kinda a crazy idea. Another con is that they can't really drive by itself, it still needs you to hold the steering wheel and take control when around accident ot people working on roads. I feel like if they want to have driving cars they should just bulid a car that can drive people instead of a car that half does it. Another con is that they are basically illlegal in most states except a couple. Would we have to visit somewhere else to expericence what crazy technology the world has for us now. I also think they are a bad idea because driving are probably going to be directly on their phone, no hand on the steering wheel or anything. And like it says, when the car needs you to take over it will tell you to take over. But i feel like people will just ignore it and get into accidents they could have prevented.

Pros are that you can half drive. You wouldn't have to really pay attention to anything around you and you could just relax while driving. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

I think that kids should do community service because they benefit them in a lot of ways. A lot of kids spend their time playing video games or doing nothing. The community service will teach them how to do other things. Tutoring can help prepare for a carer in teaching because it gives the tutors patience. If they pick up litter they can promote others to help clean parks lakes and make a healthier environment for everyone.

Some of the community services can give people experience so when they get older getting a job can be easier. It can also give them responsibility like being in charge of a cleaning group. It gives them the leadership skills they may need to run a company or run a family. They will also get to know people of the community.

Some kids think community service takes too much of their time. I wont lie it does take some time, but some kids spend weekends doing nothing. Community service has a lot of options that they can choose from. Some kids like to ride bikes, so they can consider Meals-On -Wheels. Later when they start working at a fast food restaurant they can deliver the food.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
54A8F5B2420A,"Most students who attend a school would say that waking up early and getting ready is school's biggest problem. Some may say that the students themselves are the problem. They would do anything to change school so that it follows their rules, and online schooling would seem like a great idea to them. In the end, they must respect the importance and value of school over these beliefs. Attending classes from home relieves school of its contributions to an individual, reminding us that the authenticity of a school institution cannot be replaced.

Schooling through the internet, especially from home, can cause students to lack essential life skills. An example of an essential life skill would be communication. If a student is always talking to a professor from their home, they begin to lose their social skills needed to effectively communicate with new and ordinary people outside of home. This can cause awkward, short, and even meaningless conversations in the real world. Stemming from this, finding and making new friends becomes an issue that may take a long time to resolve. Workplace skills are also extremely important skills one can lack when attending classes from home. An educational institution progressively trains students with these skills, for they are necessary in¬†order to succeed in performing well or getting a job. Having situations where these abilities are useful are mainly in the form of doing certain assignments with or without others, listening, maintaining eye contact, and being on time. Looking back, online schooling strips one of the ability to develop skills used in the real world.

Secondly, attending school from home by way of technology can be both physically and mentally damaging. The idea of looking at a screen for hours on end is a concept that many schools tend to walk away from because it is not good for your eyes. While looking at a screen can be engaging, it is true that it causes major damage to one's eyes, especially if one were to look at a screen in the dark or when they first wake up. After long days of school at home, your eyes can start to irritate and become red, meaning the body may want a break. Online school, however, doesn't give the eyes the rest they need to function at maximum capacity, causing health problems in the long run. The technology needed for online conferencing can also ruin a student's ability to sleep well. Technology can be addicting and can keep students awake for long periods of time without rest. If students are attending online school for a few hours a day, use their phone for another few hours, and potentially engage in any other screen, they can lose sleep. Getting enough sleep for normal schooling is already a problem, so online school may not have the ability to fix that problem. The home is a comfort zone for everybody, but it can lead to a strict mental mindset. It doesn't allow people to grow to their fullest potential because they're at home most of the day, isolated from the rest of the world. One only grows by way of leaving your comfort zone, trying out new things, and going to other places. The mindset it can create can be a problem when moving on to other potentially important parts of life. The physical and mental association this type of schooling can have on a student can be devastating, to say the least.

Lastly, online or video conferences promote the development of bad habits. While schools have students pledge to an honor code, cheating is inevitable in almost very student to step foot in high school. Without the physical supervision of a teacher, cheating can become a staple in one's everyday school life, if it hasn't already. A student can potentially use an online source, secret notes, or another person in the room to help them with their assignments. Cheating is essentially a form of lying as well, which is a reason why it shouldn't be done. A second bad habit that could develop would be procrastination. Procrastination is already seen often with students who go to a regular educational institution, so online education would make matters even worse. Having potentially flexible time frames can cause students to want to postpone doing their work for another time. This can eventually add up to a student having an enormous debt of assignments, waiting to be completed. Following this procrastination, a third bad habit, laziness, develops. Some may say that being at home makes a student feel comfortable and stress-free with their environment, but that feeling can get out of hand. I used to take online religious classes at home for an hour a day during five days of the week. Personally, I got too comfortable and lazy with my schedule and environment to the point where I eventually stopped taking these classes completely. I would sometimes be too lazy or distracted to get ready for the class. Other times, I would postpone the class to another day as a make-up day. In the end, my laziness and empty will to take these classes ended that schooling. So, developing bad habits is bound to occur when attending classes from home.

Attending classes from home is a misunderstood way of receiving education. It is not only physically harmful to you but it can also impact the future of your life. There is a reason as to why classrooms have existed for centuries. School institutions are meant to be a safe way of giving a students the traits they need to succeed in life and live life to the fullest. The idea of attending school online takes away almost all of the contributions a classroom can give. In the end, attending school online isn't really a form of school.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
573E39E45177,"Is distance learning such as, online learning or video conferencing more benefical than traditional learning?. In my opinion, I believe that most students that take online classes have a higher risk of failing. Therefore, they have a higher change of getting distracted. Studies confirmed that young adults are more likely to get distracted than adults since, their minds are not fully develop. I also believe that, every human being has a different way of learning and goes on their own pace.

There is positive's and negaitive's reasons about person-to-person learning and online learning. Person-to-Person learning helps the students gain more knowledge and interaction. While being in a traditional classes, you can ask questions anytime and gain a relationship with one another. The negaitives of tradtional learning is that, students attend to skip class, not listen to the teacher, and sleep during teaching. Students attend to do these negative actions because they might be force to go to school or they can not go on their own pace.

Online classes are not benefical but you can go on your own pace. Another reason is that, techonolgy is popular in this generation that students rather be in a device. Online classes have a positive side to them because there is many options online in what you want to learn about, but keep in mind that visual is harder than interacting. Visual is diffcult to understand because there is no instuctor or a teacher helping you in person. I believe that everybody is different and we all learn in different ways and different pace.

Some Students would not be able to attend at home classes because of personal problems such as, not having food to feed themselves, some do not have a roof over their heads, or they do not have access to a device. For an example, there are some students at Generic_School that do not have food at their home and all they eat is school lunch. It hurts to see Children that are not able to afford things in life that are in need such as, education. Education is in all of our life's and I hope traditional schools can still be popular as online schools. In this generation techonology is taking over students!.

In conclusion, I support my reasons and my opinions about, traditional learning is a better way to learn than online learning. They both have Pros and Cons but Traditional learning has been in our lives for so many years and techonology and devices are taking over students. Distraction is what young adults have trouble with, Online classes is not a great idea to pursued. There are many reasons and studies, why students should keep attending traditional schools. I also believe everyone works and learns in their own pace and that is why Person-to-person is way to pursued.   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,8

F9CF17C68E82,"Dear Principal,

I think that all students should be required to take part in community service.

It is a great way to connect yourself with your community and help out others who are less fortunate than you or the environment.

As an eighth grader, I take part in tutoring some of the younger sixth graders at my school.

I think of this as community service because I do not get paid for these actions.

Also, it is community service because I am helping some of the younger children at my school understand what they are learning better.

Some students might not want to take part in the community service at first.

They might be reluctant to try.

After beginning the process, those certain students might realize that by taking part in community service, you can learn more about yourself as well as the environment and others around you.

The students who at first did not want to take part in the community service, might come to realize that they enjoy helping others and from doing so, benefit personally.

An issue with requiring all students to perform in community service is the time commitment.

Some busy students might decide that community service is not worth their time when they could be doing things that directly benefit themselves.

For example, they might rather spend time with their friends than spend time with children in a homeless shelter.

I think it is important that you understand that these students might take more time to convince to take part in your community service than others.

You should not simply tell them to do the community service because they are required to but you should explain to them why it is so important and you have decided to put emphasis on it.

I think that it is important for everyone to take part in making this world a better place.

Community service is one way to get people to contribute to that.

Students should show that they have a say and have their own individual rights.

By helping others or the environment around you, students can show that they can change this world, one little step at a time.

Community service could be that first little step.

I find it very important for all students to take part in community service some time in their life.

I think by making it a requirement for the students that attend our school, everyone will find that community service helps to better understand yourself as well as others.

It is a great opportunity that we should all take advantage of.

The author goes furthermore explaining about the pros of going to Venus. The author talks about how scientists also like to go to the Venus because Venus is more earthy. It is stated, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (paragraph 4). This evidence also proves that the scientists wants to go to Venus and explore it. Venus was covered largely with oceans long ago, and it also supported various forms of life just like earth does.

Venus could be hard planet to visit, but NASA has provided a solution which could help scientists to visit the similar planet. Not only it is fun to visit, but it can help people learn about why Venus is similar to Earth and why can anyone not go there.

This would enable Teachers to adjust thier teaching style and make it easier for the student to understand the subject. Not only would it help the teachers, but the entire class as well. Teachers would be able to see if students needed individual help or if they needed to go over it as a class again.

As said in the article, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This also supports the fact that this technology could be valuable in classrooms. Not only the teacher could be able to change the lesson for a student, but the lesson itself could change for the student. This would make the student be less bored and more excited and enjoy the lesson that they are currently learning.

As technology evolves, we will use it more and more for the better use of people. This could possibly be the first step for making school a better place for students to enjoy learning.

B47F70222B3F,"Why You Should Not Use Your Phone While Driving

Many drivers today are known for using their phones for locations, for example Lyft and Uber drivers need to use their phones In order to locate where the passengers are going and to also find them, but using your phone to make phone calls, texting, or using social media sites while in traffic Is very dangerous and unsafe for other individuals on the road. According to Pew Report about 59% of young adults are more likely to text and drive and more than a quarter of U.S. adults which Is 27% admit to texting while driving behind the wheel. These are dangers numbers which leads up to some of the reason why accidents happen.

According to Chicago Tribune there are more than 67,000 active Uber and Lyft drivers In the U.S

and all are know to use their phones to find the client or the destination In which the client Is going. This In my opinion Is a great use to use a phone while driving, not to be bias but their are other ways to phone that maybe more dangerous to others safe than that, like using your phone to be on social media, not only do you not have your phone In your hand but your not endangering the passengers (friends or family members) lives but If you have your phone In a phone holder, It ensure the safety of the passenger and also the safety of the other drivers, motorcyclist and pedestrians on the road.

Teens like myself are very active on social media because of the time and age that we live In, It's one in many ways to communicate with people. As I stated In the thesis statement about 59% of teenagers actively use their phones while driving. It Is dangerous for them because not only are some of them new to driving, but If It's their parent's car and they get Into an accident, insurance may not be able to pay for It.

In addition to this that other percentage Is adults which Is 27 percent that use their phones while driving even though they are older and are suppose to know better they still use their phones on the road endangering other pedestrians. These percentages are dangerous and are Increasing over the years which shows in the amount of accidents (According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually).

In conclusion driving while using your phone is bad and it is not beneficial to anyone else on the road. The safety of all drivers and pedestrians depends on what we do and when we do it. Even though i think its ok to use your phone if your are an uber driver or lyft driver i strongly disagree with the use of cellphones while it's in your hands.

falcon_180b_v1_28,"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you to express my opinion on the school's cell phone policy. I believe that we should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, which is Policy 1.

Firstly, cell phones can be very useful in case of emergencies. If a student needs to contact their parents or guardians quickly, having a cell phone at hand can help them do that easily. This is especially important in cases where a student might need to leave school early or in the event of an emergency.

Secondly, cell phones can be used for educational purposes. There are many apps and websites that can help with schoolwork, and having access to these resources can be very helpful for students. Additionally, students can use their phones to take pictures of notes or assignments, which can help them with their homework.

Finally, allowing students to have their phones during lunch periods and other free times can give them a well-deserved break from schoolwork. They can use this time to relax, listen to music, or play games on their phones, which can help them to recharge and be more productive during class time.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 is the better option for our school's cell phone policy. It would allow students to have access to their phones in case of emergencies, give them a well-deserved break, and provide access to educational resources.

But in the other side I will like to show you what especialist people think the cities full of cars. Experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission from tailpipes. Passenger cars are resposible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emision in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

Let see these in other point of view. Think about your son or your little brother or sisster or just tink about any little baby that is born in those cities full of cars . The greenhouse gas emission is reduced by 50 percent so the other 50 percent that those kids are breathing is just toxic air. Taths why the hospitals are full of people whit pulmonary cancers and asthma. While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. But its basic precepts are being adopted aroun the worl in attempts to make suburbs¬† more compact and more accessible to public transportation, whith les space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk¬† away, on a main steet, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Something that also affect the society is the obesity. People depend a lot on their cars and forgot about to walk. It is a simple example but it had cause a lot of death and heart attac in the past two decades. ''All of our¬† develpment since World War II has been centered on car, and that will have to change,'' said David Goldberg. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoring ''car reduced'' communities, and legislators are starting to act.

It was just an informative essay to let the people know about the adventages of limiting car usages. I hope this essay help you to understand and realized about all risk that cars can cause includind cars accident. The limit car usage will help every body starting with those who accept the Environmental Protection Agency promotion ''car reduced''. You can be part of taking care about the environment, and remember ''How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.

8EA275CFABF8,"Imagine a world when all you see is people sitting in their cars and not paying attention to the road ahead of them. That seems very scary to me. I believe that driverless cars are not a good idea or the way to be going for the future. Driverless cars could lead to many fatal accidents and also many injuries.

My first argument is that technology always seems to fail. When you get a new iPhone, sometimes not everything is right in the phone or something is messed up from the start. If we had driverless cars in the future, technology would be the key function to make the car work. What if the technology failed like what seems to happen many times to iPhone users. I think having driverless cars is putting too much belief and risk into technology. You can never say when a problem would quickly approach or is about to happen, it just happens. If a problem just happened in a driverless car when the driver wasn't paying that much attention to the road, many accidents and fatalities would be on the rise.

In conclusion, I think the idea of driverless cars are very unique and out there, but as of right now and the technology we have, I could not put my full trust in a driverless car. Today, the technology and sensors needed for a full driverless car seem very unrealistic. Sensors created for the driverless car would be tested many times, but if it fails when it isn't being tested that can cause too much harm for everyone and everything in the world around us. I believe that we should stick with normal human driving for the safety of everyone.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

2ACA19551483,"Year round school and better understanding in school for the next year? Oh Yeah. With a summer project then you remember more as you have to use the knowledge that you've gained and put it to use. Whether it be teacher-designed or student-designed is up for debate, as there are ups and downs for either choice. To teach students something new, to remind them of past subjects or to help direct the students to their ideal subject in college. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is easier to teach something new, students don't forget what they learned previously and it makes the students think creatively.

If the teacher makes the summer project design then they can help students learn something new while they are out of school. The teacher giving the new information can have guide lines for what they need to know to complete the project, or to get a student ahead for the next year leading to a better year for both the student and future teacher. Not only would the student be able to learn something new, but they would also be able to use that new found knowledge in an efficient way. For example, then when I was in sixth grade then my parents took me out of public school and put me into home schooling. I would go onto a website that was used for teaching people from K-12th grade everything that they would need to know. I would do this from when I was taken out of school to the first year of middle school, and my knowledge and understanding of the subjects that we were learning was at the point were I wasn't the odd¬†ball in the class. With that part of the year and during the summer when not only was I able to catch up in subjects that I was a few grades lower in, but I was a level higher then everyone else for a while.

With teachers designing the summer project then students don't have to worry about it as much because they don't have to waste the time deciding what to do for the project all summer. Not only would the students be given a benefit from using the knowledge given to them, but they also get to finish it in almost half the time that they would have needed if they were to choose the project as well. There are a lot of friends that I know who can't decide on a certain subject for a project until it is either the night before it is due or the day off. They are very stressed out when this happens which leads to them failing in other classes as the extra stress from that one class is distracting them from the others.

Another benefit is that the student actually has to go out of their comfort zone, or they will stay in it, if the subject or the needed information is in a subject/ topic they like or dislike. Forcing a student to work on something that they don't understand is something that could help them understand it, and as they have to get a understanding before they can use it or they will not understand it and never get any better on the subject; making the student more creative in their methods for learning and for when they overcome harder challenges in life. For Example, they might get into a rut at a job that they have and it is getting difficult to keep going. Well if they are creative thinkers then an idea might pop into their head which could lead to them getting out of the rut and to a much happier life.

In conclusion, then if a teacher either from the last year or the next year will be able to help the students understanding grow. Although, some people think that the teacher shouldn't be the one to design it, but in fact the student, because it gives them a free choice on what to do, they have more fun doing it as it might be a subject they are interested in, and they might be able to grow in their field of experiences that interests them. It still could lead to students not doing the summer project at all because they might not be able to decide until the very last moment or not at all. If a teacher or teachers design the summer project then their is a lower chance that the student will forget information from the last year. Along with, the project being a challenge that could benefit both the student and the future teachers in the long term, with the student having a better understanding of the subject and/or the concept.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
B8EAF80A1409,"Many students dislike completing summer projects during their vacation time. After working hard in school, they look forward to relaxing and giving their brain a rest. It is vital that we do not mentally burnout, however, it is also important that we keep our brain somewhat active during summer break. This is why students are often given summer work. There are many different types of summer projects. Some projects are more traditional, being solely focused on reading and writing. On the contrary, some assignments are hands on, designed to test students' creativity. Although some people may think that students would create less overwhelming assignments, teachers should ultimately design summer work to ensure that students are truly challenging themselves, not wasting their vacation time, and well prepared for class when school starts.

Some people believe that summer projects should be student-designed so that students are not overly stressed during their vacation time. While this opinion is relevant, it is not a valid point because students will end up making their work too easy. Summer projects should be teacher-designed so that students are being properly challenged. If tasks are too easy, then students will be damaging their success in the long run. Their work should be difficult and involve a deep level of thinking. Challenging work is more beneficial to students because throughout life they will face many complex problems. They need to develop problem-solving skills early so that they know how to persevere during tough times. A good example of ambitious perseverance can be seen in scientific experiments. One leading historical scientist was Albert Einstein. In order to discovery electricity, he needed to perform a great number of trials. At times he felt stressed, as if he would never reach his goal. However, eventually the lightning¬†produced electricity, and he had introduced a concept that would impact everyday life forever. This portrays the significance of challenging yourself, being that challenges stimulate a stronger drive to succeed. It is often frustrating when students encounter difficult work from their teachers, but developing these problem-solving skills will immensely improve their future well-being.

Not only is it vital that students are being challenged, but they also should not be wasting their precious time on meaningless work. One of the most valuable resources that people obtain is time. This is why students should not be aimlessly spending time on student-designed summer projects. Psychologist Erik Erickson developed the eight significant psycho social¬†stages that outline the common conflicts experienced throughout a lifetime. In his seventh stage, known as ""integrity vs. despair,"" he describes the adulthood stage when people look back on their life. Many adults in this stage scroll through their overall progress and accomplishments. They decide if they spent their time wisely and lived a fulfilling life. If they look back at life and conclude that it was spent efficiently, they experience a sense of integrity. On the other hand, if they feel as if they did not make the most of their time on earth, they develop a terrible feeling of despair. It is important that students, being at such a young age, recognize the value of time. Although everyone remembers the saying ""life is short,"" many people forget to practice what they preach. If students are given teacher-designed projects, this will ensure that they efficiently spend their time during summer break.

As well as not taking advantage of their time, students need to be fully prepared for their classes. If teachers design summer projects for their future students, then these kids will be ready for the work that is given when school starts. In other words, the work assigned will be less surprising because students have already completed projects from their teachers. In the novel, ""I Am Malala,"" Malala's father prepares her to be a successful public speaker. At first Malala was not very good at speaking in front of a big audience, but he worked with her everyday to build her knowledge and improve her skills. Eventually, she became one of the most influential activists ever to exist. She is able to address¬†important topics, such as women's rights, in ways that she never could before. Through proper preparation, her weak public speaking turned into her greatest strength. This proves that goals are met when students can connect with their mentors. Students must be given the chance to build a relationship with their teachers. If summer projects are teacher-designed, this will allow students to email their teachers with questions about the assignments. This will not only generate a strong relationship, but it will also prepare students for the style of teaching they will soon face at school.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed in order to set up students for success in the long run. Everyone deserves a chance to succeed, and student-designed projects can harm this potential success. Even though some people think that students would create less stressful work, teachers should design summer projects to ensure that they are difficult enough, genuinely worth spending time on, and quality preparation for kids to thrive in class. It is important to be independent and take initiative, but it is more important to live a fulfilling life.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

301EA5259E90,"""On your mark get set GOOO!!!"" Some people would miss the sound of NASCAR or other racing events. I personally feel that not having any cars would make the world a better healthier place to live in.

First off I feel that not having any cars would save people a lot of money. Just think what you actually need to pay when you have a car. Once a month you have to pay for a car payment (if it isn't payed off), insurance, and gas. Now think that you also need to have a lisence and have your car registered. In VAUBAN Germany residents don't have cars due to the fact that it costs $40,000 just to own a parking spot. 70 percent of the families there don't own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move there. Now that is a way for the world to survive and now your wallet.

Next I will say how having less cars will affect the world's pollution. The people of the world rely on using cars wether it's to go to another state or just for a drive to the corner store. People have burned so many fossil fuels into the air that smog levels can reach record highs everyday. In Paris their was a day where they almost reached a record high and thye had to take half the people off the road and if they used their car anyway they would get fined. This caused the smog level to go down to a safe level after just five days. Smog can't go away over night do to warm daytime hours and cold night time hours and it would get trapped in an air pocket. But i guess this was just a close call.

My final reason to write would be due to the level stress driving has on people. Just think everyday you have a chance on dieing in a car due to an accedent. You just drive a metal cage at high speeds and have a chance of running into each other. When you are riding a bike you don't ever have to worry about runing into oter people all you think about is that you're having a nice time. Even when you're walking you don't have to stress about people running into you because its just walking. Besides walking is just human nature so why would we stress over it?

In summary I feel that not using cars is helpful due to not having to pay as much, their is less polution in the air and you tend to just be lessed stressed in general. Wouldn't you want to leave this a clean and stress free place?    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
5C2C61B71D4B,"Dear Principal,

After reviewing the possible cell phone policies I have come to a conclusion that I support Policy 1. This policy allows students to use their cell phones for important or recreational uses that do not distract them during class time. Also with this policy they will be able to set up transportation and be able to feel secure in case of an emergency.

Policy 2 however, I feel will be ineffective and will not aide students in any way. If this policy is chosen students will most likely still bring their cell phones to school and because of the fact that they are not allowed to use them in free time they will most likely have to use them secretly during class. This will distract not only themselves but students around them. Also they may feel almost ""dared"" to bring their cell phones and try not to get caught.

The reason I feel that Policy 1 would be helpful is because if they are given certain periods of time when they can use them without having to face getting into trouble, the students will feel their is no need to use them during class. This will help them keep focussed during class along with others around them. Also they will be able to keep in touch and check in with their parents or guardians in case of an emergency or and important occurrence.

One of the main reasons students bring or even have cell phones today is for transportation purposes. If students are given a time during lunch or free time to use their cell phones and do this it will cut out the need to bring cell phones into the classroom or anywhere else in the school.

I believe that students will support this policy and respect the rules of it. If Policy 2 is put into play I believe students will take it lightly and not follow the rules. Also they may not feel as safe or secure in their school environment. In all, I believe that Policy 1 will help benefit not only the students but teachers as well and help the school environment become a more safe, secure, and focussed environment.

You see it in countless movies and shows, the most popular probably being Back to the Future.

Unfortanatly, the flying car is yet to be made. However, many companies are working on driverless cars. Cars that you can just get in and they will drive you where ever you need.

As amazing and unbeleiveable as this idea sounds, is it worth the risks?

To be able to make a safe car that runs on its own seems very difficult.

It is not something that can be made overnight.

In fact, Google has made and is still working on driverless cars since 2009.

So, this idea has been around for long enough, but why do we not see any driverless cars on the road today?

No company can seem to make a car smart enough to drive itself.

BMW annouced 3 years ago the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car can drive in speeds up to 25 miles per hour, althought the ""not-so-driver"" must keep his or her hands on the wheel, and they are alerted when they must take over driving. Meaning that they must pay atttention at all times.

So what is the point of these so called ""driverless"" cars if they are not completley ""driverless""?

This idea can totally change the world. Although, should their really be driverless cars on the roads if they are not COMPLETELY self-driven?

Maybe not.

What if someone isn't paying attention to the road then suddenly the car is put in a situation where it doesn't know what to do, forcing the ""driver"" to spring into action.

This could be deadly.

Plus, what if people forget how to properly drive after years of a car doing for them? Then when they do need to take over the driving, their driving skills may be rusty, and they defininatly won't know what to do in an advanced situation, such as if the car was skidding and/or going off the road.

Leading to many injurys or even death.

With that being said there are still many injurys and deaths with people opperating cars.

So you may say that the argument is invalid.

Although, you can teach humans to be carful in a car, and yes we make mistakes, but humans, unlike computers, can adapt to complicated situations.

Driverless cars seem very helpful, but is it really worth the risk of death.

Would you really put you saftey into the hands of a computer?

The negative seems to out-weigh the positive.

Not saying that it is an impossible idea, just very unrealistic.

Maybe they should just start working on flying cars instead?",0,persuade_corpus,,7

The electoral college is unfair to voters. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. For instance if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to kerry, they would go to Congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Also its Unfair to the voters because of the winner-takes-all system. In each state candidates dont spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing""¬† states. In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. In defense ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates, to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states."" Ok but the winner-take-all system is still focusing on the ststes knowing that there going to vote for you, and notthe other states that possibly will or will not vote for you.

Another reason is that the Electoral college is just a disaster factor simple as that. In the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not actually gone to Kennedy. Also what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? It happened in Hawii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who presided over the senate validated only his opponents electors making sure to do so ' without establishing a precedent.

In conclusion the Electoral college is unfair, irrational, and just a hotmess. Like Bob Dole said ""Abolish the Electoral College'.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
CFD0D13D3180,"Failure to Failure Equals Success: The Importance of Embracing Failure

Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it can be a difficult concept to embrace. However, it is important to recognize that failure is not the end of the road, but rather a stepping stone towards success. The concept of ""failure to failure equals success"" suggests that individuals who have experienced multiple failures may be better equipped to succeed in the long run. This essay will explore examples of people who have found success despite failing multiple times and argue that embracing failure is crucial for achieving success.

One of the most well-known examples of failure leading to success is the story of Thomas Edison. Edison is credited with inventing the light bulb, but it took him over 1,000 attempts to develop a functional prototype. Despite this, Edison continued to persevere and eventually succeeded in creating a practical and efficient light bulb. Edison's success can be attributed to his ability to learn from his failures and use that knowledge to improve upon his previous attempts.

Another example of failure leading to success is the story of J.K. Rowling. Rowling's first Harry Potter book was rejected by multiple publishers before finally being accepted by Bloomsbury. However, Rowling did not give up on her dream of becoming a successful author. Instead, she continued to write and eventually published the first Harry Potter book in 1997. The Harry Potter series went on to become one of the most successful book franchises of all time.

The concept of failure to failure equals success can also be applied to the field of sports. Many athletes have experienced multiple failures before achieving success. For example, Michael Jordan missed over 9,000 shots during his career, but he continued to work hard and improve his skills. As a result, he became one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

The importance of embracing failure cannot be overstated. Failure is a valuable learning experience that can help individuals develop resilience, perseverance, and a growth mindset. By learning from their failures, individuals can improve their skills, adapt to new situations, and ultimately achieve success.

In conclusion, the concept of ""failure to failure equals success"" suggests that individuals who have experienced multiple failures may be better equipped to succeed in",1,llammistral7binstruct,,8
085AF5011C2E,"Dear principal, i believe that changing the policy to requiring student at least to have a B average to play sports would be wrong for many reasons. One of the many reasons would be that many students are GREAT at playing sports and they are not as good in two or three subjects, so they wouldn't be able to play. I also think that if people really wanted to play they should keep their grades up, but most don't.

For Example, say that we are in the championship game in football and are star quarterback couldn't play because he failed his science test, which means we would have to put are second string quarterback in. We would lose it and it would be great for our school to win a game for a change. Do you really think that it would improve are scores? I don't think so because then all of the boys off the football team or any other team this would happen to will quit then we will have to play second string the hole time, so really it wouldn't help. It might to some people but if you ask me it wouldn't change a thing.

I think that you should try to convince yourself and the school board that requiring students to have a C average to play sports is a good thing for the school. I would also help if we could have a good education and have a good football, softball, basketball, and track team. Thanks for your time while reading this!

7CB712FD1253,"Graduating high school after three years instead of the traditional four years has become increasingly popular in recent years. While some may argue that this is a shortcut to a college education, I believe that there are several benefits to graduating high school early. Additionally, pursuing a college education after graduating high school can provide even more benefits to individuals.

Firstly, graduating high school after three years allows individuals to enter the workforce sooner. This can be particularly beneficial for those who are eager to start their careers and begin earning a salary. By entering the workforce early, individuals can gain valuable experience and start building their professional network.

Secondly, graduating high school early can also provide individuals with the opportunity to pursue higher education at a younger age. While some may argue that this is a shortcut to a college education, I believe that it can actually be an advantage. By pursuing higher education at a younger age, individuals can take advantage of financial aid and scholarships that may be available to them. Additionally, they can gain a head start on their college degree, which can help them stand out to potential employers in the future.

Pursuing a college education after graduating high school can also provide individuals with a wide range of benefits. Firstly, a college education can provide individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen field. Many college programs offer hands-on training and practical experience that can be difficult to gain through other means. Additionally, a college education can provide individuals with access to a network of professionals and resources that can help them advance in their careers.

Finally, pursuing a college education can also provide individuals with the opportunity to pursue their passions and interests. Many colleges offer a wide range of programs and courses that allow individuals to explore their interests and pursue their passions. This can be particularly beneficial for those who are unsure of what they want to do with their lives or who are looking to change careers.

ACE3E472041C,"The rise of technology has brought about a significant shift in the way we learn and acquire knowledge. One of the most significant changes has been the availability of online classes, which has become increasingly popular in recent years. While traditional schooling has its advantages, there are several benefits to taking classes online that cannot be ignored.

One of the most significant benefits of online classes is the flexibility they offer. With online classes, students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is particularly beneficial for students who have family circumstances that make it difficult to attend traditional schooling. For example, a student who has to work part-time or full-time to support themselves or their family can still pursue their education through online classes. This flexibility also allows students to balance their studies with other commitments, such as sports or extracurricular activities.

Another benefit of online classes is the safety they provide. In traditional schooling, students are exposed to a variety of risks, including bullying, violence, and other safety hazards. Online classes, on the other hand, are conducted in a virtual environment that is free from these risks. This is particularly beneficial for students who have medical conditions that make them vulnerable to physical harm. For example, a student with asthma or other respiratory conditions can attend online classes from the safety of their own home, without the risk of exposure to harmful air pollutants.

In addition to flexibility and safety, online classes also offer a level of convenience that traditional schooling cannot match. With online classes, students can access course materials, watch lectures, and complete assignments from anywhere with an internet connection. This is particularly beneficial for students who live in remote areas or who have difficulty accessing traditional schooling. For example, a student living in a rural area may find it difficult to attend a traditional school, but can still pursue their education through online classes.

While there are several benefits to taking classes online, there are also some potential drawbacks. For example, online classes may require more self-discipline and motivation than traditional schooling. Students must be responsible for attending lectures, completing assignments, and staying on top of their coursework. This can be challenging for some students, particularly those who struggle with time management or procrastination.

In conclusion, there are several benefits to taking classes online compared to traditional schooling. These include flexibility, safety, and convenience.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,6

Source 1: ""What Is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Rgister, Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and Source 3: ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" I think that the Electoral College should be abolished and to elect a president by popular vote.

The first thing to remember, is that the Electoral College is unfair and needs to be changed to the popular vote because the people should be able to vote who they want to be president. The author mentions in Source: 3 paragraph 18 that ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" This proves that with the Electoral College in place that there may be a big contreversy about who should be the next president. Arguments would also break out between the political parties that are trying to elect their canidate president. With popualar vote you could avoid all these conflicts and disputes by letting the people elect the president outright with no questions. With this in mind, there should be no Electoral College because the author suggests in Source 3: paragraph 19 that ""The Electoral College requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pularity in states that he knows he will win."" A presidential canidate should be able to gain votes from his region because that is the states the canidate are more familiar with so, he will be able to campaign better in those states and if he becomes president he will be equal to all the other regions. You could avoid this with the fair method of popular vote.

Another key point, is that the number of votes coming from each state should be equal in the amount of votes. The author claims in Source 2: paragraph 10 that ""If you lived in Texas for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate of 34 electors pledged to Kerry. With popular vote you would not have to worry about all of the votes that each state gives from the Electoral College. Popular vote lets the people deside no the Electoral College deside. If two canidates were running for president and one was from Florida and the other one was from Alaska, their state could be the deciding factor which the one from Florida will win because it has more votes than Alaska which is not fair. Truly, the Electoral College should be replaced by popular vote because there is a winner-take-all system. The author shadows in Source 1: paragraph 7 that ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportional representation."" The thing is that with a popular vote system you would not have to worry about a winner-take-all and states that have a different system than the other states. Just let the people decide and everything will be easy and fair.

On the flip side, the Electoral College should not be replaced because it avoids any type of run-off election that may occur. The author argues in Source 3: paragraph 22 that ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in wich no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" This shows that with the Electoral College it would relieve all of the stress that is put on a canidate when they are running and the stress could also complicate the process of electing the president. With the Electoral College their will be a winner no matter what happens which will clearly the most fair way to complete the process of electing the president.

To conclude, after analyzing¬†the article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" Source 1: ""What Is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register, Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and Source 3: ""In Defense of the Electoral Collge: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A.

6EA18B20DA5A,"In today's world, people have the freedom to choose their own path in life. This freedom is what makes them successful in their respective fields. People choose their own character based on their values, beliefs, and goals. In this essay, we will analyze the reasons why people choose their own character in life and how it can make them more successful. We will also compare it to choosing a partner and learning from teachers, and give examples of these situations. Finally, we will discuss the importance of following the character that you choose for yourself.

One of the primary reasons why people choose their own character in life is to achieve their goals. When people have a clear idea of what they want to achieve, they choose a character that aligns with their goals. For example, a person who wants to become a successful entrepreneur may choose a character that is innovative, creative, and risk-taking. This character will enable them to come up with new ideas, take calculated risks, and think outside the box. Similarly, a person who wants to become a successful athlete may choose a character that is disciplined, hardworking, and determined. This character will enable them to train consistently, set goals, and work towards achieving them.

Another reason why people choose their own character in life is to live a fulfilling life. When people choose a character that aligns with their values and beliefs, they are more likely to live a life that is fulfilling. For example, a person who values honesty and integrity may choose a character that is truthful and trustworthy. This character will enable them to build strong relationships with others, be respected in their community, and have a sense of self-respect. Similarly, a person who values creativity and self-expression may choose a character that is artistic and expressive. This character will enable them to pursue their passions, share their talents with the world, and live a life that is authentic and meaningful.

Choosing a partner is another aspect of life that is similar to choosing a character. When people choose a partner, they choose someone who shares their values, beliefs, and goals. For example, a person who values loyalty and commitment may choose a partner who is also loyal and committed. This partner will enable them to build a strong and supportive relationship that is based on mutual respect and trust. Similarly, a person who values independence and autonomy may choose a partner who is also independent and autonomous.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,6

38CFC25785E2,"Lets be honest, there is nothing like being in the comfort of your own bed. Well, there is now a way one can learn while never leaving the comfort of your own home. Distance learning has taught many a way of online or video conferencing has shown how one can adapt with new technologies. Students would benefit from being able to work in the comfort of their own homes, or anywhere in the world!

If a student has been absent distance learning is a great option. Students that are out with an illness are typically out for a few days to a week, per doctor orders, and have make-up work waiting on them when they come back to school. Students easily fall behind and get overwhelmed when they miss school. By using video conferencing any student could easily catch up and get back on normal track.

There are parts of the year where in climate¬†weather is a large idea that many staff and students look forward to because of school closings. The make up work and possible add-on days in the school year are something most people do not look forward to. Being able to attend classes at home during the school cancellations would fix a majority of the additions because students would get work done, not fall behind in any lessons and teachers would still be able to teach and put grades in.

Many students may not have internet access abilities, or even computers at home. The school system could supply all of the students with laptops so that every student could be provided with one in case¬†of distance learning.

Being able to attend class from home is very convenient not only for the students but also for the staff. Schools should start considering the idea of distant learning.

6E59CC205803,"Over the summer, teachers often assign summer projects to ensure that students are still learning during their break. Usually, these projects are challenging and time-consuming, making students dread them. Occasionally, students will get to choose what they want to do for their summer projects, making them seem less like school work. Although some people say that summer projects should be teacher-designed because they would be more challenging, summer projects should be student-designed because they would showcase a student's individual interests, they would be more enjoyable, and they would show an increase in the effort level of students.

To begin with, summer projects should be student-designed because they would showcase a student's individual interests. Student-designed projects would allow students to not only choose the topic of their project, but also their method of presentation. This would mean that each student's project would be entirely different. For example, Generic_Name may choose to do a PowerPoint presentation on lacrosse, while Generic_Name may choose to write a speech on global warming. Students would be able to be more creative and complete projects that truly showcase who they are and what interests them. Each student's interests would be highlighted and the projects would allow teachers to learn more about each student personally before the start of a new school year. Along with allowing students to be more creative and allowing teachers to learn more about their students, student-designed projects would also be more fun for teachers to grade. Rather than having to grade different papers about the same topic over and over again, teachers would get to see a variety of topics and ideas, making grading more enjoyable for them. For example, if a teacher-designed summer project were to ask students to write a paper on whether dogs or cats make better pets, grading would become very boring. However if students were allowed to choose their own topic, showcasing their individual interests, grading would become more exciting for teachers. Student-designed summer projects should be encouraged because they would highlight each student's interests.

Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because they would be more enjoyable. By allowing students to choose their own project, teachers would be making summer projects seem less like school work. If a students were to choose their own project, they would be able to choose something that interests them rather than something that they do not care about, allowing the project to become more enjoyable. For example, if Generic_Name were to choose her own topic for her summer English project, she would likely choose volleyball. But if her English teacher were to choose the topic for her project, Generic_Name could end up writing about lizards, a topic that she shows no interest in, making the project dreadful. If teachers were to allow students to design their own projects, students could choose a topic that they are truly interested in, making summer projects more fun.

Lastly, summer projects should be student-designed because they would show an increase in the effort level of students. Students would become more motivated to work on their projects if they were able to choose what type of project they got to complete. In addition, students would put more effort into their projects because they may not know how the teacher is going to grade them. For example, if teachers were to design summer projects then students would likely have an understanding of what the teacher expects and how they will be grading the project. In contrast with teacher-designed projects, student-designed projects would allow students to have more uncertainty as to how the teacher will be grading. Worried about their grades, students would try to supply the teacher with their best work and put more time and energy into their project. Teachers should support the idea of student-designed summer projects so that they get the most effort out of their students.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because they would showcase a student's individual interests, they would be more enjoyable, and they would show an increase in the effort level of students. If summer projects were student-designed, then students and teachers would have a stronger relationship throughout the remainder of the school year. School systems and teachers should consider assigning student-designed projects over the summer.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3
falcon_180b_v1_683,"Meditation and mindfulness practices have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many individuals incorporating these practices into their daily routines for the numerous physical and mental health benefits they offer. Some schools have also started to adopt these practices in order to promote a more positive learning environment for students. However, there is still debate on whether or not meditation and mindfulness practices should be included in schools. In this essay, I will argue in favor of the inclusion of these practices in schools.

Firstly, meditation and mindfulness practices have been proven to improve mental health and reduce stress levels. With the increasing pressure and demands placed on students today, stress is becoming a major issue in schools. The incorporation of meditation and mindfulness practices can provide students with tools and techniques to manage their stress levels more effectively. For example, a study conducted in 2015 found that mindfulness meditation significantly reduced anxiety and stress levels in high school students.

In addition, these practices can also improve students' focus and attention span. With the constant distractions and stimuli in today's world, it can be difficult for students to stay focused and engaged in their studies. Mindfulness practices such as deep breathing exercises and visualization techniques can help students to refocus their attention and improve their concentration levels.

Furthermore, meditation and mindfulness practices can also promote social and emotional learning in students. These practices help to develop empathy, self-awareness, and compassion in individuals. In a school setting, this can help students develop better interpersonal relationships and create a more positive and supportive school culture.

While some may argue that the incorporation of meditation and mindfulness practices may be too time-consuming or distracting from academic learning, the benefits they offer far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Additionally, these practices can be easily incorporated into the school day, such as through short guided meditations or mindfulness exercises at the beginning or end of class.

In conclusion, the inclusion of meditation and mindfulness practices in schools can provide numerous physical and mental health benefits for students, as well as promote a more positive and supportive learning environment. With the increasing pressures and demands placed on students today, it is crucial for schools to prioritize the well-being and mental health of their students.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Some schools have implemented meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day.

879899ED7AEF,"Dear Principal,

I disagree with changing to grade scale to play sports.

I don't have a B average in school that is why i have chosen to go against this idea.

A lot of student-athletes don't have a B average either.

This would cause a lot of us not to be eligible to play the sports we enjoy to play.

This would also lead us to losing a lot of our games and nobody like to be on a losing team.

So this would drop participation of sports and make them not as fun as they could be.

Playing sports is a social time for students and it lets them get to know each other better.

They are also help with exercise which a lot of kids don't get.

It allows students to have something to look forward to after school. Sports are very important to students.

I do agree that students have to put school before sports.

I think because a C is the average that's what i would expect out of some students.

Other students who have a B or a A Average that the should be expected to hold that grade if they want play sports for the school.

I would like to agree with the decision of an extra class for all students to at least¬†participate in one extra activity. An example for an extra class is like to design in the yearbook,learning art,and making new friends.

First of all,designing in the yearbook for the whole school to see would be an outstanding work of art. Helping out for the yearbook could be fun in many ways and taking lovely photos of people as they have fun as well. Doing the yearbook means that the students can also cast a vote on the colors and the font on the yearbook. One of the most important part of the yearbook is the theme, like for spring and summer or even the school mascot.

Secondly, learning art is also fun to have for an extra class and getting to experience a new feeling to learn more about the activity. Having art class could interest¬†other students to join or having art cast their future job. Learning for an extra class can improve on a students skill or there love for art, and to give the students an opportunity¬†to show off their talents for the whole school to see one day.

Third of all, having a new class to go to could help out some students to make new friends and build there trust more. Team bonding is also a way to make new friends and help each other out to learn from each other. Having new friends can also lead into a group project, and build up the trust that students can make. Students can have similar skills, like to paint in the same or close style, and may also think the same idea as one another student has.

Lastly, having an extra event for students is a fantastic idea and making school a bit more exciting to go, giving the students an opportunity to choose what they are going to be in the future.

6E5F280580C4,"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students have been forced to attend classes from home, and some have even chosen to continue with online or video conferencing classes even after the pandemic has subsided. While there are certainly advantages to distance learning, there are also potential time-management issues and effects on academic outcomes that must be considered. In this essay, I will conduct research on the advantages of offering a distance learning option for students and argue in favor of providing distance instruction.

One of the biggest advantages of distance learning is the flexibility it offers. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own home, which can be especially beneficial for those who have busy schedules or who have difficulty commuting to school. This flexibility can also allow students to better balance their academic and personal lives. For example, a student who works part-time may be able to attend classes during the day and then work in the evenings, or a student who has a family to take care of may be able to attend classes while their children are at school.

Another advantage of distance learning is the ability to access a wider range of courses. Many schools may not offer certain courses in-person, but they may be available online. This can be especially beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing a particular area of study, but who may not have access to the necessary resources or expertise in their local area.

Despite these advantages, there are also potential time-management issues that students may face when learning from home. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track and complete their coursework in a timely manner. This can be especially challenging for students who are prone to procrastination or who have difficulty staying organized. To mitigate these issues, students may need to develop strong time-management skills and establish a routine that allows them to effectively balance their academic and personal responsibilities.

In terms of academic outcomes, research has shown that students who attend classes from home tend to perform just as well as those who attend classes in-person. In fact, some studies have even found that students who attend classes online may have an advantage in certain areas, such as self-motivation and the ability to learn at their own pace. However, it is important to note that academic outcomes can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the quality of instruction, the",1,llammistral7binstruct,,0

So, here's where the partnership comes in. If I partner with someone who's already in the field, like a doctor or scientist, I can learn so much more!  They can teach me all the cool things they've learned and I can help them with their research or whatever. It's a win-win!

Mr. principal i think that you changing putting a new school policy is completely unfair and its just total trash because many students well be very disappointed with this change. now im writing you this letter because i wanna try to change you disesion with a couple of reasons on what might be best for our beloved school.

first i think students will be mad and they will hate you for that and will never like you again. Second if you reduce the amount of children playing sports not only will that piss them off it well make them over weight even more then what they already are, i mean America is known for having the most over weight children you redusing the physical activity's will only make it worse. My third reason is that maybe if the teachers would tech better then the students wouldn't have such bad grades, and another thing is that some of the best players have bad grades and arnt able to do the sports they love to do just because of the grades.

My fourth reason is that if all the good players where kicked of the teams do to there poor grades then the school wouldn't be able to win any champion ships of be know for being good at a sports.

Bottom line is pleas pleas don't do that change to our school it only gonna make it a even worst school then it already is so for the sake of our over weight students and for all the kids that are good at sports DO NOT make this type of change for our school. Thank you for you time i hope you take this letter in to mind and listen to us for once.

50F828AEE977,"Dear Principal,

I am STUDENT_NAME a student of your who wants to protest against the b average policy. People should have at least have a c average to play sports not a b average to play sports. One reason i think it is bad to set it at a b average is what if the best player on the team has a c average and cant play because the principal made the grade change to a c average. We should actually get a vote on the b average policy because i believe we got a vote it would come out being a c average. Therefore, theses are a couple of reasons we should stick with a c average for a student principal.

I do get the side you are coming from to principal. I understand that you want to set a higher average on the students so they will try harder. What if some kids try there hardest and still cant get a b average and have a c average. I know you probably think that all the kids can to do it if they set there mind to it ,but the truth is that will never happen. Also if you set a c average it will take a little stress off the kids because if you set it to a b average they will do homework until there brain is fried. So i understand where your coming from.

So Principal i hope you take this letter and think about it. I am just telling you now if you set it to a b average for sports some of your best players are going to not be playing anymore. I hope you find in your heart that kids don't need stressed out all the time they need breaks from homework. So if you can change the average from a b to a c it would help out a lot of people including me. I hope u consider my letter and change the average from a b to a c for all of kids.

BC0D8223C604,"Mr. and Mrs. Smith get prepared for the elections, which is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. They're both really assured on who they are electing, Mr. Keen, the remarkable Republican canidate. Mr. Keen would most definitely operate in Mr. and Mrs. Smiths' favor, due to the fact that Keen offers a convinient medical insurance for they're family, opposes of abortion and is projecting sites for the unemployed individuals. Clearly, candidate Mr. Keen is a go for the Smiths'¬† family, but what if they're doomed of their vote not getting qualified due to the systems', such as the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a ominous process, due to the fact that voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, disvalues ones' citizenship rights and it's going to influence the country of not voting.

Firstly, the Electoral College is a cynical process where not everyones' vote is taking account of. Imagine, voting in the upcoming election in vain knowing that organizations that only select the votes of one entire state, unconsious of the other millions individuals in the other surplus of the nation exist. The possibility of the one in fifty states choosing majorly one particular candidate, is highly risky for the goverment, and no one should permit putting in risk the goverment with this stubborn prefrence of electoral votes. Incontestably, the Electoral College System, is not a method of voting that should be unresposibly utilized to advantage the four years of presidency.¬† Secondly, voting is a stupendous privilege that allows' one to vote in the adulthood stage. Perhaps, because in the adulthood stage one is aware of all the current economic situations and one is noticable of the advantages a former president can serve them. The former citizens' privileges are unfortunately disvalued lately, with the Electoral College system. It's dreadful that the anticipation a legal individual once awaited on, can no longer be celebrated or reinacted, with this fashion of electing states, that manage the majority votes of the respective candidate. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? That results in a false and negative answer. Thence, it is more than clear that the old-fashion and benevolent method of regrouping all the cadenced voices of all the recievable votes is appropate and suitable for the public and president.¬† Thirdly, the Electoral college influences countries to not participate in the privilege of voting. Once the citizens, have the knowledge of these unprudent organizations, voting is going to be outlooked as an petition, that isn't necessary of taking toll of. Due to the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing'' states. The pending thought, that ones' state might be chosen out of the many, is certainly doubtful. The Electoral College, can upbring wins in the popular votes but lost in the presidency, these democracies need to be abolished because it should be a doubt that the President and the opposed public, should be uncondemed of. Clearly, the definition of this service is dooming and should be reinforced from the Constitution, to prevent the countrys' votes from going unknown. It is at time, at last, to conclude all the disadvantages of the Electoral College in one, it's ominous due to the fact that the public votes not for the president, but for a state of electors, disvalues ones' citizenship rights and influences' the country of not voting. The opression against the Electoral College, has it's witty motives. As we all know, the most popular partys are the Republic and Democrat. If the Electoral College, only selects one state out of the entire nation, that allows one states, that carries one culture of people to form the regimen of the rules of that successful party. No goverment, should suit this fashion, because it isn't right in any shape or form.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
65E3280D899A,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes¬†seek for more than one person because some people might have a better idea than others; usually the one's who are educated, or the people who have been through a lot. Most people seek for mostly older one's for advice because they might have more experience than most of the young ones; and this can have you someone much older than you, and that has been through your age give you advice. Seeking multiple opinions also gives you more ideas, so that you can evaluate all of them and see which ones have more meaning in them.

One day this boy named Generic_Name, was in his house¬†playing video games in his bedroom. His mom came upstairs, and said, ""Get of the games and go help your brother with his homework!"" Generic_Name responded ""Fine mom."" Generic_Name walked downstairs and sat next to his brother on the couch where he was doing his homework. His brother asked Generic_Name ""what should I do when my teacher chooses me for the spelling bee that is coming up in one week."" Generic_Name responded ""you should'nt¬†because you are not good at spelling."" Generic_Name's brother went downstairs and asked his mom. ""Mom, what do I do when my teacher chooses me for the spelling bee thats coming up in one week."" The mom replied, ""you should accept if you are confident in your ability to spell, and dont do it if you are not comfortable with spelling."" This is a story that I made, to show you that asking multiple people can get you somewhere in life, and it can lead you towards the right path. That is what Generic_Name's brother did, he asked Generic_Name for advice, and Generic_Name's advice was kinda sketchy, so he went and asked him mom for advice and that advice really motivated him.

This is a story that I made to show you the reasons we ask more than one person for advice. Generic_Name's brother asked Generic_Name for advice, and Generic_Name told him that he is not capable of succeeding in spelling, but when he asked his mom, the mom gave him way better advice than Generic_Name did because the mom is more¬†educated, or has been through a lot. we have to get the advice from the educated, so that we can educate¬†ourselves¬†on the advice that we got. We also have to ask the people that have been through a lot¬†because they can tell us their mistakes, and we can learn not to do those mistakes.

The reason we want ask older people for advice is, so that we can get the opinions from people that already went through our age, for example our parents are older than us, and they have already went through our age; they can also give pretty good advice. We also ask older people for advice so that we can get advice from the wise, which means that they have more experience than us, and they can give advice to us that we can never come up in our minds. Older people can sometimes give you bad advice, so you have to ask older people who are actually educated, or have been through a lot¬†in their lives.

We ask many people for advice, so that we can take all the advice that was thrown at us, and we can go evaluate them. We also ask many people for advice, so that we can get different ideas of what people think, for example your trying out some clothing, and you ask your sister first, she said the it looks kind of too dark, but then you ask your brother, he gives you way better advice. The reason your brother gave you way better advice is because he is a male, and he knows if male clothing looks good or not on his brother, so you have to know who to ask first. We also ask multiple people for advice because you never know who can give you some crazy opinion that you have never thought before, and that just created you to an opening to something that might benefit you.

The day that Generic_Name told his brother that he could not succeed in life was the day he realized that he gave his brother really bad advice, and he did not motivate him to keep practicing his spelling, he told him that he would fail if he did the spelling bee. He went outside for fresh air, so that it could distract him from the terrible thing he did to his brother. When he looked at the sky, he saw no clouds, when he looked back down he saw someone charging at him with a terrified face, it was a girl. The girl said, ""There are bad people bullying my brother, what should i do?""

Generic_Name was thinking about telling her to bug of and to tell her to leave him alone, but he thought about what he did to his brother, and told himself that he cannot do the same mistake twice. Generic_Name said ""go tell a guardian, or your parents to help you out, or just get your bother and run away, and leave them alone. And so the girl took his brother and ran away; on that day he was proud of himself that he gave someone good advice, and since then he gave good advice all the time to other people.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
FFD022809B8F,"Studying Venus may be an great idea to the author and it may be very needed.

Venus seems to have had some type intrest to some people such as the author who suggested studying the planet even if it means harming yourself should be acceptable.

The author believes that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is close to Earth and many don't really know this because Venus isn't talked about as much as it should be. The planet was descibed in the reading and the description seemed like it would may be an good idea to study Venus as it states in the text descibing Venus and I quote "" The planet has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,moutains, and craters"" this description gives you an inside view of how Venus looks on the inside.

Although many don't really think about Venus it's a very important planet and the author listed some very good pointers to think about that'll make you want to look more into the planet. The author stated and I quote

"" Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet"" the author believes that Vensus was once like earth and he thinks looking more into Venus can solve some unanswered concerns. There is a maybe that Venus may have had an ocean there as it states in the text "" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" this states that it seems to be life on Venus before. If there was life on Venus before beacuse of what their observing then studying Venus might not be so bad and the author may be right that despiting dangers studying Vensus is a good idea.

Studying Venus after all may not be a bad thing after all. The author gave many details and explained a lot about Venus that some mahy have never known about Venus. Venus is an over looked planet everybody knows of the planet Venus but nobody really knows the history behind the planet. The author explained that Venus seemed familiar and seems as if he's been there before. Venus looks much like Earth as if a human once lived there before as descibed in the passage. It seems like Venus is worth risking something dangerous happening to you just to study it because the author suggested it meaning he's down for what it takes to study this planet the right way.

In conclusion the author suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit shows how committed he is on studying the planet. The author suggested that looking past all of the dangers that comes with studying Venus is a good thing to do because there may have been life on Venus before. If there was life on Venus then studying the planet may give the people studying the planet some good informantion to back up their assumption of human living on the planet long ago.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

Have similar features like earth. Venus could be the nearest option to visit.

Astronomers are facinated by Venus beacause the believe ""it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" meaning a similar discussion about Mars. They believe that Venus, long ago, ""was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" demostration it could be an interesting visit to Venus and if the statements or beliefs are true, Sciencetist might find an answer why Venus doesn't support life or the bodies of oceans dissapear if it did have those features in the first place.

""Venus still has some features that analogous to those on Earth"" meaning there could've been a possibility about life on Venus but also was discover that ""the planet has a surface of rocky sidiment and inclused familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" demostrating interesting theories people can make why those familiar features are in Venus and how they were created if no life existed there.

Finally, Venus ""can be our nearest option for a planetary visit,"" for example: and ""end of the world"" scenario. People could travel to Venus to start a new life there, if researchers make an innovation to make it safe to land in Venus and probaly restore life in the planet if it did long ago.

The conclusion is, the reasons above explains why studying Venus is worthy despite the dangers. The visit can inspired a lot of researchers to make trips on othe planets that they may think it was Earth-like at some point or supported life in it.

The planet Venus may have a thick atmosphere meaning a human won't be able to survive; however, the innovations that can be created for those problems can solve it. The features the planet has might help us and make us understand why now Venus doesn't support life anymore and how humanity can avoid the same problem.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
F348A404E38B,"Learning is the most important thing an individual can do in an unfamiliar enviroment, whether it is academic or non-academic. When a a school assigns work, it is for one of two reasons: For practice, or to learn. Summer vacation is a long period, long enough for many students to forget what they're doing. However, only the student knows what he or she needs to practice or work on to sharpen their skills. Summer projects should be student-designed because only the individual student knows what they must do to improve upon themselves.

Firstly, more often than not, students postpone projects until the very last iota of time they have recieved to complete a project, or worse, even start on the project. If the projects were student-designed this most likely wouldn't be a problem. While not necessarily the best option for those with creative issues, having a summer project be student-designed means that the student would grasp what they were doing more, because who knows the students' limits better than the student themselves? For example; if I recieved a project designed by a teacher, i would most likely be discouraged, because i'd have to fill a teaching professionals' expectations, which are undoubtedly larger than most students' expectations. In comparison, if myself or another student were the one designing the project, I would be more enthiusiastic in my completion of aforementioned project, because I'd realize subconsciously that if it claims to be student-designed, that means the expectations I must meet are most likely smaller than if the project were teacher-designed. This means that theres more of a chance that the student would turn in his or her project on time, instead of asking for an extension, due to the fact they stayed up all night writing one singular paragraph while they spent the entire summer hanging about with their friends.

Additionally, if a project is student-designed, it's more relatable. Many teachers admriably try to keep pace with students in terms of relatabillity, they try their best to find out whats occuring in their students mood and media, but they end up failing numerous times and instead, end up looking like they want to be the ""cool teacher"", which is definitely not relatable. Many times Teachers, or the school board, choose unrelatable prompts for essays, and concepts for projects that just aren't interesting to the student body. In most circles, students usually know what their peers are interested in. Many essays that are written over the summer have prompts such as; ""What did you learn over the summer? provide specific examples of how you've learned these things, and cite it in MLA format."" In truth, thats far too formal for a project that's supposed to be written about something the student is passionate about. Instead of the aforementioned prompt, a student would most likely assemble one that looks more like; ""What are a few things you enjoyed this summer? Provide the history of these hobbies or activities and cite your sources where possible."" This approach puts far less stress on the student and overall helps their morale, whilst still remaining relatable.

Lastly, Students need to find something they'll actually learn from and enjoy in a project. Many students come from under-privileged families who can't afford to go on a true vacation over the summer, including myself, and this approach results in guilt and panic from them when a project is chosen to be written about something special they had done over the summer because not everyone can afford to go out to Disney World, or Six Flags America, or even travel for the summer like the use to. For example; A lot of those families just stay home and live out the normal lives, just doing simple things like oversleeping to relax. in the time of many teachers' childhoods, it was not like this. Instead of asking what they had done over the summer, projects should inquire what they enjoyed over the summer. Many students have steady hobbies or workplaces that they enjoy practicing and attending, and it would be wise to ask them of this, as these are things they are passionate about, and who better to write the instructions for such a project than a student?

In Conclusion, if schools are to have summer projects, they should be student-designed, because it would benefit the student more in the long-term than if they were teacher-designed.   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,4

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and to argue in favor of retaining this system for electing the president of the United States. While there are valid concerns raised about the Electoral College, such as its lack of direct democracy and the potential for discrepant outcomes between the popular vote and the electoral vote, there are compelling reasons for keeping this system intact.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. Unlike a direct popular vote, where disputes over the vote count are more likely to occur, the Electoral College system minimizes the potential for such disputes. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This lessens the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote and provides a clear winner in the election.

Another significant benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president is not just a regional favorite, but rather someone with trans-regional appeal. Each region in the United States does not have enough electoral votes to elect a president. Therefore, candidates need to appeal to voters from various regions in order to secure the majority of electoral votes. This requirement promotes the representation and consideration of interests from all regions, preventing a president from being solely focused on a specific region's concerns.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also encourages candidates to campaign heavily in swing states. As Judge Posner emphasizes, tossing-up states are the ones where the election is ultimately decided. Consequently, voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, thoroughly evaluate the competing candidates' proposals, and make informed decisions. This increased attention from voters in swing states raises the overall level of thoughtful voting, which is desirable for selecting the president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system restores some balance to the political weight of large states that lose representation due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. In a popular vote scenario, large states would enjoy even more influence, potentially overshadowing the interests and needs of smaller states. By awarding electoral votes proportionally to each state's population, bigger states still receive more attention from candidates in campaigns, but not to the point that their influence becomes disproportionate.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the necessity of run-off elections. This is particularly important in cases where no candidate achieves a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College system tends to produce a clear winner, eliminating the need for extended and potentially costly run-off elections.

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it discourages potential voters in states where they believe their vote will have no effect on the outcome. However, as Judge Posner points out, voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference, rather than ones who believe that a single vote may decide the election. Despite this perceived limitation, voter turnout in the 2012 election reached approximately 50% of the eligible American population, suggesting that voters are still motivated to participate in the electoral process.

In conclusion, while there are legitimate concerns with the Electoral College system related to its lack of direct democracy and the potential discrepancies between the popular vote and electoral vote, the system serves several important purposes. It ensures certainty in the outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages campaigning in swing states, restores balance in representation, and eliminates the need for run-off elections.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I implore you to seriously ponder the advantages of the Electoral College when evaluating potential changes to the current system. The preservation of this process is crucial to maintaining a fair and effective means of selecting our nation's president.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,radek_500,,4

I believe students should use there cell-phones during lunch periods or other free times because it gives them a sense of freedom, and occupies their time. Student have a ton of reasons why they need to use cell-phone, but they leave out the good reasons.

Now other students may have the same reasons, and we are not gonna say no to bringing our cell-phones. Some teachers may even encourage it what harm could they cell phones really do just make sure the are off in every class period, so when they walk in tell then to take out their cell-phones make the teachers check to see that they are off and go on with the call period, and if you see then confiscate them until the end of they day or until parents pick them up.

CD9FDD5F9F9E,"Does failure play a big role in success? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that, ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although failure often just ends up in failure, I agree with Winston Churchill's statement that failure can lead to success if people continue to use enthusiasm.

First of all, many of our inventions used today are a result of failures.

For example, Edison created the lightbulb, but failed many times before he discovered electricity.

He used his faith and motivation to not give up and keep trying even though he had many set backs.

He accidently made a circular shaped like glass ball which became a source of electricity. If Edison did not keep trying, we would not have electricity today. Also, many scientists have created medicines after many failed attempts.

For instance, there is now a chicken pox shot that prevents people from getting the chicken pox.

Through many experiements with mixure of chemicals and failed trials, scientists were eventually able to find a shot that prevents chicken pox from entering your system. These examples show that failures often lead to success if people never give up trying.

Second of all, many students have failed in school, but if they keep trying and keep their enthusiam, they will succeed. For example, I have had a hard time in school, especially with passing my sol's. When time goes on, I try harder and harder, and spend more time studying with my teacher.

As of today, I have passed all of the sol's I need in order to graduate except for the one I am writing about right now.

I also have a learning disability and ADHD and have a hard time paying attention and often lose focus in my classes.

Even with my disability, I have not given up and keep coming to school and get extra help from my teachers so that I can graduate this year.

I make sure I follow the rules, don't skip class, or don't miss school becuase it's so hard for me to make up what I miss. Although many seniors like to skip class, I do not skip becuase I want to earn a high school diploma. Even in education, there are failures, but through hard work and a good attitude, students can succeed.

In conclusion, I agree with Chruchill's statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of entusiasm.""

Even though people will experience failures, there will be success if they work hard, keep the enthusiiasm, and never give up.",0,original_moth,"Task: Write an essay discussing how failures can lead to success if people use enthusiasm.

Some of the reasons people want to elminate the Electoral College is because the way it works. For example if you live in texas and want to vote for a John Kerry you'd actualy vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to kerry. Who knows if they win the statewide election and go to congress with kerry. And what if ""this so called electors"" don't even have or hold an public office, who are they in the first place and how do they get picked. Many people congressional men and women want the Eletoral college gone because of the close calls it's had to make and some think those pick favored or didn't favor the country.

Like the 2000 fiasco which was one of the biggest election crisis of the century. And not to mention the 1960 of John F Kennedy which many segregationists replaced democratic electors with new ones who would oppose Kennedy. And yet same even oppose their own party's candidate for some they choose. Some states even send two slates with in them it happened in Hawaii in the same election. Thankfully Vice Persident Richard Nixion only validated only his opponent's electors, made sure to do so without giving up a percent.

But still people say a state like California whos population is apromximently 35 million people and 2 senates get to have the say over them that's what may make it difficult. Rhode island aswell because they only have a minimal population so they are not off so bad like others. And what about the now large amount of illeagal emmagints whom can't get a vote because of citizenship. They need it to vote and the ones who can offten don't know who they're voting for. At most basic level it seems unfair because of the winner-take-all system.

I say keep it because if the Electoral College vote ties then then the US House of Rep. and the Senate choose the winners. The House The Persident and the Senate the Vice Persident. You are the one who choose those who govern you not them so therefore choose whom you want and give them the benefit of the doubt.       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

The concept of being ‚Äòsomebody else‚Äô can be a useful tool in many aspects of life, such as accomplishing goals, avoiding conflicts, and even adapting to different environments.

For instance, in the political unrest between the current President Donald Trump and the Democrats, changing identities could help to increase understanding and foster relationships. We can also look at the example of American secret service agents disguising themselves as Muslims. This could be useful in diffusing dangerous situations, since they would be able to gain insights into the culture of the environment they are in and therefore be better equipped to handle and work around such conflicts. 

Moreover, in everyday settings, changing identities could help us to adapt to different environments as it allows us to gain new experiences that can contribute to our personal growth or to reach our goals. For example, with the ability to become somebody else, we are able to open ourselves up to new possibilities and meet others with open minds.

By the way what will happen if your main computer that command your driverless car error or overheated is that mean all the traffic will be shutdown and you cannot do any thing until you fix that

The last thing i will mention about is the signal that you sent back and forth from the car to the gps or the controller how can you control the car when there is a place that got a bad signal right now some place you can't even get a good signal with wifi then how can you do that with all this driverless car system

I think their is to many problem to fix before you start this system you need to think about the people that work for the public trasnport and all the bad thing that will happen.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
E45264EA1006,"Phones and driving

Usi5ng your phone while driving is very dangerous because a lot of people die because of texting and driving. Especially a lot of teenagers who drive use social media while they're driving.

Which is one of the main cause for so many deaths not only in teens but in adults.

As social media continues to progress and now that everything is on the Internet texting and driving isn't the main issue. The main issue is that there is nothing that is stopping people from being on their phones in general. Phones in general are a big distraction and especially while driving. People will tend to look at emails, check social media, or just simply send a text message while they are at stop sign but that can be just as dangerous as well because as the driver hits the gas they are looking at their phones at the same time and then boom that's wen the big accident happens. This is a very common thing that happens with a lot of people who aren't careful enough to put their phones down and pay attention to the road.

A lot like drinking and driving many teens they can get away with texting and driving, but what they don't know is that being behind the wheel and looking at your screen at the same time is a dangerous. While recording yourself behind the wheel is another mistake waiting to happen.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
llama_70b_v1142,"Dear Mrs. Smit,

I think policy 1 is way better than policy 2. If we're allowed to have our phones during lunch and free times, we can call or text our parents to let them know where we are or if we need a ride. Plus, we can use our phones to look up information for our projects or homework. It's really helpful to have access to the internet during school.

Also, if we're not allowed to have our phones at all, it's hard to keep in touch with our friends and family. We might miss important calls or messages from them. And what if there's an emergency and we need to call 911? It's better to have our phones just in case.

Turning our phones off during class time is a good compromise because it makes sure we're not distracted while we're learning. But taking away our phones completely is not the right solution. Technology is a big part of our lives and we should be able to use it in a responsible way.

Please consider policy 1, it's the better choice.

Sincerely,

AB6284069E18,"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you won't have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls aren't great because most people aren't paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you won't meet any people and you won't learn how to socialize at the end you won't learn how speak to people.

The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school.

To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you aren't at a on campus school,You're grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you don't go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. It's not fun staying home

With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day it's still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they aren't doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education that's not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they aren't using there whole brain to do they're work. One of the major reason why online classes aren't good because you can just google the answers that's just cheating you aren't learning it's cheating.

Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students don't listen or even look at the screen to the call. It's just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you won't have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldn't need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education.

The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they won't be able to anything for the future for there education because they didn't pay attention or learn it well plus they won't have any friends to know them.

In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.",0,original_moth,"Task: Research the incidents of academic performance of students using off-campus education versus on-campus education.

This statement highlights the importance of failure in the pursuit of success. Failure is a natural part of the journey to success, and it is how we respond to it that matters.

An individual's enthusiasm level plays a crucial role in their ability to succeed. Enthusiasm is the driving force behind any successful endeavor. It is the passion and energy that propels us to keep going even when things get tough. When we are enthusiastic about something, we are more likely to put in the effort and persist through setbacks.

For example, when I started my own business, I was incredibly enthusiastic about the idea. I had a clear vision of what I wanted to achieve, and I was determined to make it happen. However, there were many times when I faced obstacles and setbacks. I could have given up, but my enthusiasm kept me going. I believed in my idea, and I was willing to put in the hard work to make it a reality.

Most students spend their time and weekends texting, visiting friends, watching television, going to parties and getting into trouble. I believe that all students should be required to perform community service. Being active participants of community service will help students stay or become well rounded. Community service could better the way our towns and cities look. It would also give student an idea of what they would be required to do in high school and college.

I believe community service is a positive influence on all students. Just because it would take up some of students time doesn't mean it will take up all of their time.

Many students are lazy and complain they have nothing to do, if those same students could put there time and effort towards community service their perspectives would be changed. Community service wouldn't only change our community, but it would also change students and the way they view our environment.

0F7FEA47FA3E,"Many schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning although they're not in school. These projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. There are many reasons on why it should be the students choice and not the teachers.

Many examples can help explain why summer projects should be student designed. For example, projects require a lot¬†of work and time. Student's time, especially the summer. Students believe summer is their time to get away and enjoy themselves without having to worry about grades or failing a class. Teachers assign books or projects that they believe are whats best for students. That's why many students never actually do their summer reading or any summer assignments. The projects be boring and long. If teachers assign a book to read over the summer, students should be able to pick their own book to read or research, after all it's their time and freedom on the line.

If students were able to choose their own topic or own projects, they're more likely to do them. Mainly because they're doing something they want to do. A book or project they chose to research or read about. Its in their interest. When something is interesting for a student they're more likely to keep up with it. Who wants to waste their free time doing something they don't want to do or that doesn't interest them? A lot of kids never open or touch a summer project, let alone complete one. The summer is meant for kids to enjoy themselves, live their life a little without any worries, the one time they can actually enjoy themselves rather than two weeks off for a break and jumping right back into school and real life problems. It's where they can actually enjoy being a kid, staying out all night, being with friends constantly, or family whom they never see during school. These summer projects can prevent a lot of that, especially when parents be hard on students to complete a assignment they're not interested in. It's extremely difficult to try to get in the correct head space and force yourself to do something you don't want to.

Although it's always the possibility that students may not do the work even if they choose their assignment, schools would get more participation than before. If schools don't at least try, how would they know? Even if it's not every student, as long as more participate and try. Some turn out is better than none at all. Even with all the freedom and option to choose their assignment, its always that handful who just don't care enough to complete a summer assignme

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed. It's their time, effort and work going into it so they should have the opportunity to choose their own projects. There are many more reasons on why this should be allowed.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
2E46CC728216,"The end of car culture around the world. Cities around the world are banning driving for weather conditions or for experimental purposes. In German suburb driving has been forbidden as well as street parking, driveways and home garages. People have been selling their cars just to move to Vauban, Germany. The limiting of car usage has been a great factor to help the enviroment, and to excersize.

The end of car culture is coming to an end because many people have been leaving their cars at home and taking the bus or walkin to work. People are driving less, and the youth have are not excited to be driving. Sociologists believe the decrease amount of driving is due to the fact that we are able to connect with our friends over the internet and no longer need to see each other in person. In many cities around the world are banning driving because of enviromental purposes. In Colombia, there is a car-free day where cars are being banned with only taxis and busses permited. The goal is to promote altenative transportation and reduce smog. In Paris driving was banned due to the amount of smog. They blamed the smog on diesel because 67 percent of the cars use diesel. Although cars were banned in Paris, congestion decreased about 60 percent in the capital of France, after the five-days of smog.

The limiting of car usage can benefit everyone. This is because around the world everyone drives, nobody thinks twice about it. Driving has been a huge part of the America can life, but it seems it is coming to an end people are relying more on walking and riding a bicycle or taking the bus. Car limiting benefits everyone because it will help people stay healthy and hike or bike to point A to point B. People are becoming more enthusiastic about not driving. Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout cities; uneven sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rudh-hour restrictions have cut traffic dramatically; and restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

73D2B941F40F,"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes for home? In my opinion that wouldn't be a good idea but also be a great idea. School should allow students to decide if they wanna attend¬†at their school, home, or both. Anyways it's a good idea that some school allow their kids to attend classes from their own house.

Allowing students to attend classes from school is good idea. That's giving the students time to do there work and to learn whenever. Students could sleep one or two more hours in. Most kids either play sports, have a job, or maybe both. They won't get much sleep then they will be tired the next morning. If we could have classes at home students wouldn't have to worry about sleeping in class and getting yelled at by the teacher. Most students wanna be home school because they either get bullied,¬†tired of getting in trouble, but mostly students these days wanna graduation early.

If we also had classes at home more kids will be more safer than at school since what's happening right now in 2018. students wouldn't have to deal with getting suspend or expelled because most kids these days get that. School wouldnt have to deal with drugs, gang violence, or anything that's harmful to the school. Then school drama wouldn't happen a lot in school if we could just be home. It will also be a great idea if we could attend classes from school and at home.

It wouldn't be a good idea because most students wouldn't do anything or make someone else do it. Some students like to be teach in person and if they were at home then they can't learn at all. some students are just too lazy. What about gym and other non core classes? We could have a time when they gotta start there class and if they don't sign in then they get mark absence. If they have a non core class then they can just go to school to take it but most classes you could probably take online.

D9FB5E411A4F,"Sure thing! Here's my essay on how first impressions can be changed:

Hey there, so I was thinking about how first impressions can be totally wrong, and I have a pretty cool example to share. Like, I was watching this YouTube video the other day and the guy in it was just so annoying at first, but then he started talking about his passion for photography and I was like, ""Whoa, this dude is actually cool!"" So yeah, my first impression of him was totally wrong.

And then there was this one time when I went to this fancy restaurant with my family, and the waiter was being super rude and stuffy. But then he started telling us about how he was working towards becoming a chef and stuff, and I was like, ""Wow, this guy is actually pretty cool!"" So yeah, my first impression of him was wrong too.

I think it's really important to not judge people based on first impressions because you never know what they're really like. Like, you might think someone is a total jerk at first, but then you find out they're actually super nice and stuff. Or you might think someone is super nice, but then you find out they're actually a total jerk. It's like, you can't always judge a book by its cover or whatever.

Anyway, I think that's why it's important to give people a chance and not just judge them based on how they seem at first. Because you never know, you might find out they're actually really cool once you get to know them. Like, I never would have thought the guy from that YouTube video was cool, but then he showed me his passion and stuff. And I never would have thought the waiter at that fancy restaurant was cool, but then he started talking about his dreams and stuff.

98D257987FDE,"To the non-morning students, don't you hate having to be awoken so early every morning only to have to get dressed and ready to go to a place where students dread of going, school? Well, you are in luck because there are classes where you do not have to go through all that trouble and just take your time waking up. The alternative to going to school is online classes are classes, classes that you can take online and from anywhere at all. One no longer has to go to the trouble of waking up early and panicking about what to where for the day and just relax at home in their pajamas.¬†Taking online classes will benefit students who want to take the classes by giving them more freedom to decide their own time tables or day schedules and be able to work at their own productive speeds.

Online classes are different from normal classes where you sit in a classroom all day. Students can take these classes at home or out anywhere they feel comfortable working. Classes are usually one-on-one with just you and the instructor of the class, so it is a bit lonely for those who like to work in groups with other people, but is perfect for students who prefer to work alone and do not like to work with they noisy sounds of other people. There are no more distractions from other noisy students trying to disrupt the class anymore, and this will allow you to work more efficiently. Having no distractions and a good working environment helps with a the student's working condition and let's them work faster then if they have peers talking and distracting them getting less work done.

Benefits of not having to go to a school are not having up so early in the morning. Students can choose whenever they want to start their class in the day or during the evening. There is more freedom in getting to choose your class schedules and it let's you build in your own free time¬†when the student needs to because only yourself knows when a break is need for yourself. Other upsides to not having to go to a school is not having¬†to carry those heavy backpacks with bulky binders everywhere. Online class teachers can not give you physical handouts to hold, unless you print them out yourself, so there is no need for binders and all that trouble. The online classes have more writing assignments and less projects than in school, so if you do not like writing then the online classes maybe aren't the best mach for you.

Working in online classes is a more productive and beneficial class for student who prefer working alone and working from home. The classes aren't for everyone, but there definitely are those who would benefit more from taking these online classes to taking normal school classes and would also want to take these classes more. Being able to choose and control your schedule and work from home lets students work at their own speeds and better benefit their growth in learning. Online classes should definitely be in a student's choices when deciding new classes.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
140E9C687F68,"Last school year, over 92 percent of students at my school participated in extracurricular clubs and activities.

After being surveyed, it was found that 98 percent of the students involved in clubs would recommend their activity to others.

Students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities because they allow a student to discover or¬†pursue¬†something they enjoy, learn commitment towards an activity, apply it to many things outside of the club, and still have time to do other things after school.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is they can pursue, or discover an activity that they enjoy participating in.

Two years ago, I joined yearbook club because my best friend was in it.

Starting out, I didn't¬†think that I would enjoy it at all because I don't like editing.

Luckily, I was assigned to help take photos for the yearbook, and soon after joining, I discovered how much I enjoyed photography, which I would not have discovered if I hadn't joined that club. Most schools offer a wide variety of activities, like student council, chess club, or sports teams.

After gathering information from over 250 schools across the country, it was found that the average number of activities and clubs offered at each school was 21.

A few schools had almost 40!

Extracurricular activities are a great way for students to find something they love, or for students to get involved with their school, and with so much choice, there is something for everyone.

Another reason all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities is students can learn a new skill not taught in school, and students learn commitment towards something they sign up for.

Most schools require students to take five core classes and two electives.

Many students use their electives to earn credits they need to graduate, like language courses, and fine arts classes.

Some students enjoy these classes, but there are plenty of students who do not enjoy them.

Requiring students to join a club would allow students to learn a skill or participate in an activity that they would not otherwise have time in their schedule to do.

In addition, extracurricular activities¬†teach students the importance of commitment.

Last year, my sister signed up for the Eco-action club, and she was required to sign a commitment form that made her stay with the club and attend all semester.

She learned through that experience that it was important to find an activity she enjoyed and stay commited to it in order to get the most out of it.

Some students believe that they can join an activity, and switch whenever they feel like it, however this causes a lot of disruption to the people who are committed to the club, and does not allow the student to learn a new skill.

Requiring students to stay in one activity all semester would teach the importance of commitment to the student, and would allow them to get the most out of the extracurricular they have decided to take.

Another reason that students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities is the many applications that each skill has.

This year, it was found that students who participate in extracurricular activities score, on average, five percent higher on final exams than students who are not involved with any clubs or activities.

This shows that extra-curricular activities have a positive impact in the classroom.

A survey given to over 300 universities showed that colleges are 12 percent more likely to accept someone who participated in school clubs and other extra-curricular activities than someone who didn't.

In addition, there are many life applications to the skills learned in an extra-curricular activity.

For example, someone who takes part in student council learns leadership skills and can apply those to almost any situation. If a student joins the basketball team, they learn how to work as a team to achieve a goal, which is a valuable skill in life. Another example would include someone who joins a robotics team.

Other than learning how to make robots, the students who join robotics club learn how to make a plan to complete a task, problem solve, and handle themselves under pressure at a competition.

Even after learning about all the positive impacts that extra-curricular activities have in their schedule, some students are still concerned they will be unable to fit extra activities in their schedule along with homework, after school jobs, and community service. Clubs run about 45 minutes after each school day, and with the school day ending at 2:15 PM, students would be out of school at 3:00 PM, leaving hours to get home, do homework, and do anything else a student has in their schedule.

One of my friends participated in chess club after school, and got home around 3:30 PM.

He then worked on his homework until 4:45 PM, and worked a job until 7:00 PM.

Even though he had a lot to do after school, he still made time in his schedule to do chess club with his friends, and at the end of the year he said that he really enjoyed participating in a club, and he would do it again next year, and in years ahead.

Extra-curricular activities should be required for students because they allow a student to discover or pursue something they enjoy, learn commitment towards an activity, apply it to many things outside of the club, and still have time to do other things after school. Extra-curricular activities are important, and should be required, because without them, most students wouldn't have anything to look forward to each day.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
3E9AC2434A7F,"Select schools offer distance learning, a way of schooling in which the student is able to ""attend"" class through online or video conferencing, therefore, a student not able to attend school because of any situation may continue schooling and receive their education from any location or situation. This would benefit students with any medical issues, or family/home life issues; They could still continue schooling and receive their diploma without stepping foot inside a school building.

A child suffering from any physical or mental instabilities or frequenting hospital time would highly benefit from distance learning. A student should not feel the stress of falling behind in school or failing classes, when they should be focused on healing themselves and remaining healthy and happy. At no point in time should a student feel the need to put their own physical or mental well being¬†aside so that their school work should survive. If a student has any issues such as needing to stay in hospital or home the online or video conferencing would be a way of continuing social contact in education, furthering education, but also extending brain development, and taking their minds off the present situation, which they most likely dont wish to be in. Of course in some medical emergencies or severe health situations there are complications by which distance learning would not work at all and continuing schooling wouldnt be first concern. Mind over matter in which, mind not only stands for its self but also the human body, and matter is anything other than that.

Many children suffer from problems not of the outside world but of issues that stem from their home environment and people contributing to their home life. In a situation where a child may live not in a location close to any schools, though rare, may happen because of a parent or guardians decision. A child may have to watch younger siblings or take care of grandparents, though social norms say a child not be put in such situations so that they may not attend school; But for some that is their way of life that family comes first, and that is the way that parents or guardian wish to raise their child. Or that a students parents live a life so that they move or travel frequently, because of a military career or government positioning. In these conditions the child should not be punished for their parent or guardians lifestyle or what they chooses to value, they should have a fair chance at schooling just as any other child receives.

Whenever you go up you always have to come back down in some way. Meaning that there is always cons or failures in this way of education. A student may cheat, because they have no educational instructor to watch over them as they do school work. Or that some students may take advantage of this program so that they dont have to go to school. But they are choosing their life in those moments and if a students wishes to cheat or not attend, when thrown into their future the only person that is hurting in the end is their selves. That is their decision and their education, and the program may then be giving them the biggest life lesson they would ever receive.

In the end I believe that the pros out weight the cons in the amount of students that this program would help and change their lives for the better, highly out weights those who would take advantage. You may watch a child who without the program would have never graduated high school¬†or even middle school¬†go on to do great things in life and thrive, because they were given a chance by the distance learning program.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

I think we should have a club in doing community service. Some of the students think it is a wonderful idea and some think it's a waste of there time. I think we should have a club in doing so for many reasons. The first reason is because if we don't take care of our community then it will be a mess and no one would want to live here. The second reason is that if we have a clean community, children would want to play in a cleaner area instead of a messy one.

The third reason is that if there is litter on the ground then it will attract mice and disgusting animals and no one I know likes mice running around every where they go. The forth reason we should have a club is that if you want children to learn and if they don't know how to do something then students could tutor them and they will learn and be better at it. the fifth reason is that when people don't have help and they think no one wants to help them then our community would be filthy and abandoned.

3572E4DC8EA5,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service should not be required. It should stay optional to those who have the time to actually do the things that will help. Some people are too busy or feel as if they don't get enough free time. Others just want to have time for themselves without any stress. They shouldn't be required to do something they either don't want to or don't have time to do. For example, someone might have to work on a project that is due in a few days. They need all the time they can get to finish it on time and get a good grade, meaning they don't have an opportunity to go outside and do some work. However, I do think people should take into consideration the fact that helping your community in a positive way makes you a better person. If you have a lot of extra time to do anything you want, you might want to do community service.

If students were required to do community service, you might see some do it half-heartedly. They won't really enjoy it, and they might even mess some things up. It would be more of a job than service. The people who don't want to do it will be more likely to do something that gets them out of it, like skipping or leaving early. They might accidentally or intentionally harm or insult people who do like working for community service. They could encourage people who do it willingly to stop.

To people who do work with good intentions, there should be some kind of reward for their efforts, like a small treat, such as a piece of candy. That alone would help people see they are doing a good job by the fact that they are getting a little compensation. Now I know it's called community service because you are helping the community out of the kindness of your heart, but it would encourage them and make them feel good about doing it. They would bring friends and family to help them, people who wouldn't normally want to do it.

E71DABB44645,"This essay has been written to take in consideration the advantages and disavantages of a four-day school week with each day considering to be ten hours which for some people it might seems to be a better way to conserve energy and resources.

As a student I can say that I agree with this ""benefit"" but in this case I don't agree with making school two hours longer than usual for some students spending eight hours in school is consider to be enough becuase people get exhausted by spending most of the day sitting in a classroom. For example: in every classroom there is someone who is always sleeping during class due to the a lot of work school leave us to do, people who has work after school, and even sports. These reasons of why people gets to be too tired to stay up during class, imagine having to spend two additional hours in school just to have a three day weekend which might seems good but it really doesn't.

Spending two hours more than usual for four days it just a way to still using energy even though people think they are saving energy but they really are not doing any better, let's use this as a example: the two hours we are using extra for the four day it still makes up for the eight hours we are losing for the fifth day of class. The extra two hours of Monday-Thursday sum to be eight hours that people still use the energy, which means they aren't really saving energy

Example number 1: my friend Generic_Name loves the idea to have a four day school because this means that he will have a extra day to do homework and to spend time with his girlfriend Generic_Name. For him this new programs works perfectly and is an advantage for him.

Example number 2: My boyfriend Generic_Name loves to study but he does not agree with this new idea because he has sports to do after school for like about 2 hours of training for the basketball team in our school and then after that he works for 4 hours to help his mom with his car insurance which means that he won't get enough to sleep at night because after he gets home from work he has to do homework so we won't have to turn in it late. Like him there is a lot of more students in the same situation. Who does thing sacrifies to help their parents to make the payments.

However, teacher's opinion matter too and they will be tired of speaking ten straight hours too, remember that they aren't robots who are just set up by the government. This means that they might not even agree with this new idea of making school loger for students and teachers.

My school should not follow this model because they should think in everybody's benefits including teachers and students plus the staff of every department in the school's main office to make a fair decision for everyone in school. We don't know if this new adaptation will work in the schooling system which we don't have guarantee of this idea working well for us as a community.

The technology in 2018 is getting bigger and smarter. The technology is taking over jobs and everything. The facil action coding can be use for some important hings like like they can use it in the police office or somewhere that they really need it. The students can choose to use it or not they wont do it if they dont want to thats like making u do it.

E5F378BE5F7C,"one day on Feb 29th, Generic_Name did not have the best looking shoes at school. He started getting bullied and he had multiple choices but wasn't aware of all. Generic_Name started asking people for advice. Therefor he has got multiple point of views on his own situation. Although he could use some help, that still did not mean every point of view would make his problem the best.

advice was gvin and point of views but not every single one made his situation worse. Generic_Name uncles had started giving advice, although Generic_Name friends gave him advice to. Generic_Name knew for sure it still was right to go to older people like adults. some friends said you could fight the big bully, by better shoes and etc. Some of the adult point of views was, tell an important person at school, teachers, school workers and etc. was some of his advice able to help? If so how can the advice help? advice could help for many different situation because almost everybody has advice from past events that happen to them which is good because people can share there advice to help other people.

How can advice help? advice can help you in a situation, but also if you get the wrong advice it can cause the wrong thing to occur and a bad idea for the future. advice can help you understand the situation from a few people thinking and opinions. Ex:

imagine an puzzle, your thinking is a piece to the puzzle but when you get multiple thoughts from others, which is other point of views that can help you gather everybody point of view and advice. When you get different information you can put all the different advice into one whole point of view on an situation.

My great great grandma always said

""just listen to some advice it can help through stages of life.""

Always be open minded some people can give you negative advice. Although you can think advice helps, it can help if others are giving it to you positive. Most likely people who give good advice they made it farther on from one of there own mistakes or situations they had to deal with. some people want different reactions and try to cause you to do negative actions and negative things although its better perspectives and advice your able to get.

Although advice is mostly good and helpful. You're still getting an part of an opinion, when getting an part of an opinion its still and idea. Although you are getting opinions its your job to turn all the opinions to your own idea or which you think is best to help yourself out in your own situation. When others are giving you opinions you still have to keep in mind that it is an opinion and its not always the right thing even though opinions are in the vocabulary when we have an conversation about others giving each other advice. Most advice you should most definitely pay full attention to, and use and dont take for granted an put some use to it because in life advice can always help you and get you some where farther. One day you can turn it around and give others advice. Everyday you could be giving advice even if you dont know you are.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3
BBE8AE3B2B09,"As an eighth-grade student, I have been thinking about whether it is a good idea to finish high school in three years. While some people may argue that it is a good idea to finish high school quickly, I believe that it is not. In fact, I believe that it is better to take the traditional four years to complete high school.

Firstly, finishing high school in three years would mean that students would have to take more advanced and challenging classes. While this may seem like a good idea, it could be overwhelming for some students. Additionally, taking more advanced classes may not necessarily mean that students are better prepared for college or the workforce. In fact, some students may struggle to keep up with the workload and may not be able to fully understand the material.

Secondly, high school is not just about academics. It is also about socializing and developing important life skills. Finishing high school in three years would mean that students would have less time to participate in extracurricular activities, volunteer work, and other activities that are important for personal growth and development. Additionally, students may not have the opportunity to develop important life skills such as time management, budgeting, and decision-making.

Finally, finishing high school in three years may not be financially feasible for some students. Many students rely on financial aid and scholarships to pay for college. If students finish high school in three years, they may not have enough time to apply for and receive financial aid and scholarships. This could mean that they may not be able to attend the college of their choice or may have to take out loans to pay for college.

In conclusion, while some people may argue that finishing high school in three years is a good idea, I believe that it is not. Finishing high school in three years would mean that students would have to take more advanced and challenging classes, would have less time to socialize and develop important life skills, and may not be financially feasible for some students.

D9018539576D,"Technology has revolutionized the way we interact with each other. It has made communication easier, faster, and more accessible. However, it has also brought about some negative effects. In this essay, I will explore the impact of technology on human interaction and analyze both the positive and negative effects.

On the positive side, technology has made it easier for people to stay in touch. With social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, people can easily connect with friends and family from all over the world. For example, a person living in the United States can easily keep in touch with their relatives in India through video calls and instant messaging. This has made it easier for people to maintain long-distance relationships and to stay connected with loved ones.

Another positive effect of technology is that it has made it easier for people to collaborate and work together. With tools like Google Drive and Slack, people can easily share files and communicate with each other in real-time, regardless of their location. This has made it easier for people to work remotely and to collaborate with others from different parts of the world.

However, technology has also brought about some negative effects. One of the most significant negative effects is that it has made it easier for people to be isolated and disconnected from others. With social media platforms, people can easily spend hours scrolling through their feeds, ignoring the people around them. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.

Another negative effect of technology is that it has made it easier for people to lie and deceive others. With tools like Photoshop and video editing software, people can easily manipulate images and videos to make them appear different from reality. This can lead to mistrust and confusion, as people may not be able to tell what is real and what is not.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on human interaction. While it has brought about many positive effects, such as making communication easier and collaboration more accessible, it has also brought about some negative effects, such as making people more isolated and disconnected and easier to deceive. It is important for individuals to be aware of these effects and to use technology in a responsible and ethical manner. By doing so, we can ensure that technology continues to have a positive impact on our interactions with others.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,1
FA483ED371E7,"when getting advice i believe you should ask more then one person. Asking more then one person can really help you get a better opinion on what your asking or need advice on. A good reason to ask more then one person their opinion when asking for advice is maybe they know more then you, they could have a different opinion on your topic, and they could have more reasons then you on why you should do something one way or they other or agree or disagree with your topic.

Sometimes when taking advice you should ask someone older then you. Because they are older then you they could probably give you better reasons to make a better choice. Asking your parents for¬†advice would¬†be great because they√É¬Ç√Ç¬¥ve been your age before so they know how to act in the situation. Also asking your teachers would be a good group of people to ask for advice from because they are very smart and more educated then then you are

Asking more then one person on their opinion could be very helpful if you are doing research. Because if they have a different opinion it could possibly be better then your opinion¬†and make more since. Or in some cases if you ask different people you could change their opinion to agree with you. Sometimes you can have the same opinion as someone but have different reasons to agree with the topic, so you could give them more reasons to make a better choice and they could¬†give you better reasons to make a better choice.

With some cases people could agree with you but have better reasons then you on a topic. sharing your opinions with different people could make them agree more with your topic then they already do. If you are arguing one side of a opinion but don√É¬Ç√Ç¬¥t have many reasons talking to more people could give you more and even better reasons to agree with one side of an argument or topic. But if you have the same reasons as them you could probably come up with better reasons to agree with one side of the topic that will encourage others to agree with your side.

I believe getting out in the world and putting your opinion out to others about a topic would help people agree with what you wanting advice on or agree with the topic you are agreeing with. Also asking for advice from people can help you get better reasons for people to agree with you. Plus if you ask for advice it can help you do thing the right way instead of the wrong way. For example if you are working on a car or building a house or even a school project advice can go a long way to help you because advice can teach you to do it the correct way or help you with something you messed up on. That√É¬Ç√Ç¬¥s why advice is important to me and i believe it is a good thing. Do you think advice is good or bad?",0,persuade_corpus,,3

E25FE9E05F36,"cultivate a positive attitude and provide examples of how it can improve one's life.

The benefits of having a positive attitude are numerous and can greatly enhance one's overall well-being. Firstly, a positive attitude can lead to improved mental health. Studies have shown that people with a positive outlook tend to have a lower incidence of depression and anxiety. This is likely due to the fact that a positive attitude allows individuals to focus on the good things in their lives, rather than dwelling on negative thoughts and emotions.

Secondly, a positive attitude can improve one's relationships with others. People who have a positive outlook tend to be more approachable and likable, which can lead to stronger connections with friends and family. Additionally, a positive attitude can help individuals navigate difficult situations with others, such as conflicts or disagreements, in a more effective and productive manner.

Thirdly, a positive attitude can increase productivity and motivation. When individuals have a positive outlook, they tend to be more motivated to achieve their goals and are more likely to persist in the face of challenges. This can lead to increased productivity and success in both personal and professional settings.

Finally, a positive attitude can contribute to a healthier lifestyle. Studies have shown that people with a positive outlook tend to make better health choices, such as eating a healthier diet and engaging in regular exercise. This can lead to a lower risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, and an overall healthier and longer life.

Successful people tend to have a positive outlook on life, which can greatly contribute to their success. They view challenges and obstacles as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as insurmountable obstacles. This mindset allows them to approach problems with a sense of optimism and resilience, which can lead to greater success in their personal and professional lives.

Cultivating a positive attitude can be done through a variety of methods. One way is to focus on the good things in one's life and to practice gratitude. This can involve keeping a gratitude journal, expressing thanks to others, or simply taking time to reflect on the positive aspects of one's life. Additionally, practicing mindfulness and self-care, such as meditation or exercise, can help individuals develop a more positive outlook and improve their overall well-being.

E853D5DD528D,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that seeking guidance from experts and authorities is crucial in making important decisions in life. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of seeking guidance, analyze different experiences and opinions, compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of relying on our own knowledge versus the advice of experts, investigate the consequences of bad decisions and the potential for violence, discuss strategies for communicating effectively with others and building better relationships, and explore the impact of how technology has changed the way we seek guidance.

Firstly, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can help us make informed decisions. Experts have specialized knowledge and experience in their respective fields, and their advice can be invaluable in navigating complex situations. For example, seeking medical advice from a doctor can help us make informed decisions about our health, while seeking legal advice from a lawyer can help us make informed decisions about our legal matters.

Secondly, different experiences and opinions can provide us with a broader perspective on how to choose a good path in life. For example, someone who has faced adversity in their personal life may have valuable insights into how to overcome challenges and make better decisions. Additionally, listening to the opinions of others can help us gain a better understanding of different perspectives and make more informed decisions.

Thirdly, relying on our own knowledge versus the advice of experts has both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, relying on our own knowledge can give us a sense of control and independence. On the other hand, relying solely on our own knowledge can lead to a lack of perspective and a narrow-minded approach to decision-making.

Fourthly, the consequences of bad decisions can be severe, and the potential for violence is always present. For example, making a decision that leads to financial ruin can have long-lasting effects on our lives, and the potential for violence can arise from misunderstandings or disagreements. It is crucial to seek guidance from experts and authorities to avoid making decisions that could have negative consequences.

Fifthly, effective communication and building better relationships are essential in making informed decisions. Communicating effectively with others can help us gain a better understanding of their perspectives and build stronger relationships. Additionally, building stronger relationships can help us navigate complex situations and make better decisions.

Innitialy , the advantages of limiting car usage is a benifit due to the fact that communities will be less dependent on cars. In source 3 pargraph 28 the author explains an example of a benifit of limited car usage stating ""uneven, pitted side walks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush -hour restrictions have dramaticly cut traffic ; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have croped up."" this shows how human beings are using cars less by walking increasing some health issues ,creating less traffic accidents and increasing the economy by shoping with the money they have saved from not using cars so constantly.

Although some say that distance learning would not benefit students, actually students should be benefited from distance learning to attend their classes from home because it can help students who have disabilities and it can also help students see school from a different perspective of learning.

Those who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. They believe students could have trouble with social interaction in the future. They also think that it can motivate students to be dependable on artificial life. For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends.

Distance learning can benefit students who have disabilities. When I used to live in Honduras, I had a friend called Generic_Name. Generic_Name had a weird condition on her legs, she could not walk. It was very hard for Generic_Name to attend school. Her mother, called Generic_Name, had to push her wheelchair every morning so that Generic_Name could attend school. Our school was about 30 minutes away from home, by walking. During school time, Generic_Name had to push her wheelchair to get to her classes, restroom and recess. Even though, Generic_Name would get ready early in the morning, she would usually be late for school. Sometimes, Generic_Name would not get good sleep, so it was very hard for Generic_Name to pay attention in class. I think that it was not Generic_Name's fault for not attending school on time. I think that people with disabilities like Generic_Name, can benefit to attend classes online from home. It would save them time, so that they can get a good sleep to pay attention in class.

Distance learning can benefit students see school from a different perspective of learning. Last year, my cousin Generic_Name, refused to go to school. My cousin, had bad grades at all of his classes, at the beginning of first quarter. My cousin didn't like school at all. He would usually say that he would always be tired to attend school because he had to wake up early in the morning. My cousin, thought that he was really bad for school. I would usually hear complains of my cousin about the school's free lunch or about him thinking that he was not made for school. My cousin then talked to his counselor about this issue of him not being able to pass all of his classes. His counselor told him that he could attend all of his classes online, so he did. My cousin's grades are really good now, and he also thinks that it was and amazing experience, for having the opportunity to attend all of his classes. I think that my cousin was not bad at school, he was just not receiving the way of education he needed. I also think that people like my cousin, can be benefit by distance learning because they can experience their school year from a different way of learning.

In conclusion, distance learning can benefit people with disabilities, to help them feel that their necessities also count as students. Also it can benefit people who believe that they are not good for school, so that they can experience a different way to learn and feel useful. I think that distance learning can benefit students with this kind of problems, improve and be equal like the rest of the students, regardless their way of learning.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

204C675CDF5A,"Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is just wrong. People are already feeling like they are being watched through their technology as is, and this would only validate that we don't have any privacy.

Technology just keeps growing and getting more advanced. We have robots that can cook, and cars that can drive themselves. While all of this can make our lives easier, you have to wonder where what these robots see goes. Today, there is a huge issue of privacy from the government. Almost all of our devices have cameras in them now, and we might not be the only ones who can see through them. With this facial expression recognition, it would only prove that we are being watched. I'm sure that some, if not all of the computers data gets observed by a human at some point, which means that you don't really know who is watching your every move.

Not only is this technology a threat to just your personal privacy, it could end up being a threat to your life. If someone has access to see through your computer, who knows what else they can access. So much of our lives are put on our computers with us trusting that noting will happen to that information. The article says that the technology can react to your face when you see certain ads on websites, which means that they are most likely able to see what is on the screen. Say you are logged into your bank account and switch over to another website that has an ad on it, while your bank tab is still open. Someone may be able to see that bank account information and rob you of your money. This example can be applied to many other things as well, like your credit card infomation if you buy anything online, or social sercurity number. At any time i'm sure this technology could also pinpoint your exact location, and if that gets put into the wrong hands by chance, yous ands your friends and families could potentially be in danger from an in-home robbery, or even possibly a murderer. Even in classrooms, the school's information could be hacked and threatened, so is it really even worth the risk?

I can see the positive side of this technology. The artuicle talks about how it can react and change ads based on your face, and even modify lesson plans for children in school, but unfortunatley the bad outweighs the good. There is too much of a risk of what can be seen, and who has access to that information, even if it is used in classrooms to help students.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
B7E3734CD1FA,"Limiting the usage of cars has a varirty of advantages. From having a less expensive life, to less air pollution, and overall a generally happier life. Thinking about all the excess and stress that comes with owning a car is tiring. Not to mention the hazardous effect it had on our lives. Would it not be nice to just take off some of that burden off of you, and be a happier person?.Let me help you out on how to achieve that.

Owning a car is pricey! In Freiburg along with paying for your house you also have to pay for a parking garage, which comes with a hefty price. Did i not mention the distance you have to walk to park? lets just say you might as well have taken the bus.""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park---large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.""(source one,section two). With you alone driving to work and back everyday will tally up to over a hundred dollars spent every week, now add children into it, and their after school ativities, also add emergencies. See where this is going? sure you might need a car now and then, having a car is not a bad thing. How about Carpooling? It will reduce that price you have on your gas recipts and create more time for bonding and interacting with people.

Health or driving? Well if you are not healthy you can not drive can you? With all of the automobiles we have today it is bound to affect the earth. The smog in the air leading to that first cough that can lead to something more terminal. Imagine what it would be like if you had less cars, or even no cars at all! well the capital of France tried it and the results were amazing.""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..""(source two,section fourteen).¬† Now think about if that ban that Paris enforced,was tried out in other countries. Just that little change in the amount of cars on the road let to that difference of the pollution. Probably led to a difference in someones health too.

Everything stated above leads to happiness, from the less expences that will have to be paid, and the less damage that the pollution will have on your health. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter""source one, section three).Also when there are less cars on the road your community will be able to connect more and have better infranstructure, which would make them¬† happy just like it did for the people of Bogata, Columbia.""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks;rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up.""(source three,section twenty-eight).

Overall the advantages of limiting car usage has many benefits to it. From having a less expensive life, by not having to pay for gas so often, car insurance, and evrything else that comes with it. Having better health also is a advantage of the limitation of car usage. Also one of the most important aspects of life, happiness comes with the limitation of using cars. So there is no reason to not try it out, there will be more benefits.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
llama_70b_v1312,"Zoos have been a controversial topic for a long time, with some people arguing that they are necessary for conservation and education, while others believe that they are cruel and unethical. In my opinion, zoos should continue to operate, but with certain conditions.

Firstly, zoos play a vital role in the conservation of endangered species. Many zoos have breeding programs for animals that are on the brink of extinction, and these programs have been successful in increasing the population of certain species. For example, the giant panda is a well-known example of a species that has been saved from extinction thanks to breeding programs in zoos. Additionally, zoos also help in protecting animals from habitat loss and poaching.

Secondly, zoos are an excellent way to educate people about wildlife and the importance of conservation. By seeing animals up close, people can learn about their behavior, habitat, and the challenges they face in the wild. This can inspire people to take action and make a positive impact on the environment. For instance, many zoos have educational programs that teach children about the importance of recycling, reducing waste, and protecting wildlife.

However, it's important to note that not all zoos are created equal. Some zoos still engage in unethical practices such as animal trading, inadequate living conditions, and exploitation for entertainment purposes. Therefore, it's crucial that zoos are regulated and held accountable for their treatment of animals.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments against zoos, I believe that they can serve a purpose in conservation and education. However, it's important that zoos are held accountable for their treatment of animals and that they prioritize animal welfare. By doing so, zoos can continue to play a positive role in protecting endangered species and inspiring people to take action for the environment.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The role of zoos in conservation and education has been a topic of debate.

B4EB26957632,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard of the idea you've developed on how a c average determine wether a student has the ability to play sports or not. I do think that grades should effect student's athletic privileges, but that is if a student fails a class or multiple classes. Failing deserves no privileges and a c average is not failing. A c average is between 70 and 79 and failing is 69 and below. I do not think that the idea that you came up with should be enforced on student athletes. I think if a student athlete works hard enough but still does earn grade of a c in a class they deserve to participate in sporting activities because they still put forth all of their ability to pass the class.

I also don't think the idea should be passed because i just finished up basketball season and towards the end of basketball i had a c in us history class if the idea you have would have been passed i wouldn't of been able to finish the season with the team and help win our last game.

Again i do not think the idea should be passed for these specific reason. A person can only try so hard and i am sure student athletes try to exceed their limits.

CE86E6DF4702,"Today's world is full of ideas and innovation. Sometimes there are good ideas, and sometimes there are bad ideas. You can never expect all good ideas from one person, and that brings me to Sergey Brin, co-founder of the world's biggest search engine Google. Brin states his company is developing a car that operates without a driver- to an extent. Do not be fooled, Google has not came up with a completely autonomous car, though the project's future does seem bright.

There are many faults when it comes to a self-driving car. First, you will have to understand that, despite all of the technological advances brought on by our society, the car has advanced fairly slowly. With this, one has to realize the change from a car controlled by a person to a car controlled by itself may not be well-suited.

Secondly, there seems to be somewhat of a complication when it comes to regulations of a new concept. For example, in the passage ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"", the author brings up the issue with creating new traffic laws in order to accomodate the autonomous car. Would that not be a hassle? In my opinion, there are far more things to worry about than a driverless car. All of the time used to create laws, roadways, hubs, and so forth could be spent on medical research or fixing our environment.

On the other hand, the industry of making and manufacturing these cars and their components could create jobs for people living in our desperate country. On the flipside of that, what if, similar to all other industries, labor is outsourced in order for companies to establish an edge early? When dealing with social issues such as these, all conditions must be considered before moving on.

With this idea of self-driving cars, I really can not say I agree with the project. I feel like if there ever was to be a car like that, the problems would far outway the common good of it all, and perhaps the whole thing would turn into a hastly jumbled mess. All in all, the idea of an autonomous car seems outlandish and unnecessary, not to mention sloth in an already lazy America.          ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

03C96AF26E75,"Have you ever asked somebody for advice but don't know whether it's good or not?

You may not know if the majority of your friends will agree, or you may need to compare multiple pieces of advice.

Perhaps you just need more options to help you.

These issues would be solved if you talk to multiple people about their advice.

Seeking multiple opinions rather than just one will help someone make a better choice because advice may be more accurate, there will be more options, and advice can be compared.

If one person gives you an answer to a math question, you know they could have the wrong answer.

However, when other classmates agree, you realize that there's a good chance that the answer is correct.

The same goes with sharing advice.

If you notice multiple people are giving you the same advice, then that advice is much more reliable.

This is only possible if you ask more than one person.

Everyone wants more options for just about everything.

Whether it's flavors of ice cream, colors for your dream car, or advice to take into consideration, you can't go wrong with more options.

Having lots of advice is so beneficial because it opens you eyes to things beyond your own field of vision.

Your friends or family may come up with something fantastic that you wouldn't have thought of without them.

Also, there's no harm in asking more people for their advice.

The more options one has, the more likely they are to find something they're truly happy with.

So, you have so many ideas to choose from but don't know what to pick.

This could be seen as a problem for having too many options in anything.

In the case of choosing which piece of advice to go with, you must first compare and contrast your options.

Once you've removed the advice that you're displeased with, you'll need to find the pros and cons of the remaining advice.

This should give you a good idea of which advice is the best.

It may even be possible to combine some advice.

It's difficult to find the value in something if you don't have something else to compare it to.

That is how comparing multiple pieces of advice can give you a better understanding of which advice to take.

It's clear that asking multiple people for advice is much better than just asking one person.

By asking more than one person you can distinguish which advice is reliable, discover more possible options, and compare the advice given.

These will prove much more difficult (if not impossible) when you just have your advice and the advice of one other person.

There is no downside in asking more people for their ideas. I hope you will choose to ask multiple people for advice instead of just one.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Image you are in a classroom and an emergency occurs, and there is no one else to help you, what do you do? This is why cell phones are important to have at school. I am writing this letter to explain the importance of cell phones at school. I hope you take time out of your busy day to read my letter and take it into consideration.

First off, cell phones are not cheap. students also treat them like it is there child. would go nowhere without them. This information, I feel can teach good parenting skill for later on in life. students should keep them off in school, but they should be able to care them around like little children they will be able to have once they reach adulthood

Secondly, cell phones are a great way to communicate. This is a great way for students to communicate with other students all over the school. This would help students with studying and would make sure that no student is left out by his or her self. cell phones can be a great boost to self-esteem all over the school. This would reduce the amount of bullying and would give kids a real chance to make good life friends.

Lastly, if a emergency where to happen to a student at school. Other kids would be able to call for held if needed and would even save a kids life.

If a student would have a cell phone without emergency contact number, then they should not even be aloud to have a cell phone in the first place. So say one of your kids had an accident at school wound' t you want the to contact you.

I thank you for taking time out of your bust schedule to come and read my letter. I hope this will change your way of thinking about cell phones in school, and i hope you go with the first policy of cell phones.

Hi, I think that all students must participate in community service. I think they should because our Earth is getting messy. I have seen many students litter all over the school instead if putting it in the garbage where it belongs. I've seen some students throw banana pealing on the ground. I think you should convince the students to participate in community service. If they no that littering is doing many damage to our Earth maybe they might listen.

Lets talk about the positive aspects of community service, such as, cleaning the Earth makes our home much healthy. Also it is great for exercising. Walking around picking up litter actually burns calories, interesting Isn't it. By doing this we are setting a positive example to our Earth. This doesn't even take too much time. Just doing it for about ten minutes a day isn't bad. Plus if they need something they can get it after they're done, it's not that hard.

I'm here to help you convince them. Try showing the students a little video of what is going on when they litter. It might help them understand that community service is important. You can also make a speech about it and I can help you with the information. I'm just trying to keep our Earth healthy and clean. I hope this helps a lot, thank you.

They can tell your emotion by your movements of the facial muscles you rises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your ordbicularis oris around your mouth tighten your lips to show anger. One thing that technology is doing that i think is super cool because they are using technology to read students. I think its a great idea because maybe the students doesnt understand the computer and it can explain its self and i also thinks its a good ideal beacause what if the students was bored and it could make it more fun for the students. i think this would be pretty cool because if the students is having a bad day the computer would cheer them up and put a smile on their faces.

This is a great ideal because say if the students is coming confused or bored it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. the same technolody can make computer - animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes some comuper need to understand that, too

It's also a good ideal for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking on her his or her face. of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried ect. Haveing a computer that understand how they feel will make them feel better and at least they know their is something that understand how they feel.

Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly) .Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movement in a real face or in the painted face by weighting the different unit, the software can even identify mixed emotion this should that some kids might not like the computer even though it's understand how they feel.

conculsion It's mostly trying to let the students know that they understand how they feel sometimes and they know the students not gonna talk to their friends or teacher about it so they want to bring computer even though you can't talk to them but they want the students to know that the computer understand and try to cheer them up.

604E0A104A97,"Dear Principal:

Sports and other activities are essential to a student's life. It helps them develop and have fun. Sports can also have its drawbacks. I agree with you. I think the policy should be changed so that students shouldn't be allowed to play sports unless they have at least a grade B average.

To start off, sports and other activities can take time with the child's studies, causing them to have low grades. In the future the low grades will not help them to have a successful life. The grades that students make in high school can affect their futures, whether they go to college and have a well-paying job or not. Students with a C average should not be allowed to play sports and other activities because they already have a low grade, why keep on going from distracting sports. The students need to concentrate on school and to make better grades. Thirty percent of students say their grades get lower when they're involved in a sport or activity since it distracts them.

Another supporting reason is that sports tend to separate students from more important things, such as doing their homework, studying for tests, and others. This will get them lower than a C average. Students with an average B have proved they can handle these things since their grade is satisfactory. Its also unfair for those students who make an average B who play sports because they work so hard to get those grades to be able to play sports. I have had experiences with that kind of unfairness.

To sum up my thoughts, these all comes down to education. I understand that many students have a grade C average but I think changing the policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

CA9891FE1EB4,"The Electoral College is a process made by the founding fathers for the election of presidents by the Congress's vote. The Electoral College is a process, but it is an unfair process. Americans are supposed to vote for who they desire to be president, not a group of electors in Congress. There is no possible way for Americans to choose their president if at the end of it all, a group of electors make the final choice. According to the Office of the Federal Register, Americans choose the state electors when voting for President because when voting for president, Americans are actually voting for the candidate's electors. It makes no sense then to vote for a president, let's just make it to where we vote for electors because we obviously aren't voting for who we want as president.

The main purpose of voting is to help the candidate American voters want as president to win the election. If popular vote was the way to determine who would be elected as President, everybody would be happy. There are times in an election when everybody is sure that the candidate they voted for is going to win. Americans watch as they see the votes go up by popular vote, but then later, the candidate they thought would win has lost because of the Electoral College. If popular vote was the way Presidents were elected, everything would be made easier without controversy. However, since the Electoral College does play a big role in the election of presidents, popular vote is never going to be a working system. Americans just need to figure out that their vote is never going to really count, but the Electoral College's vote surely will.

In an article by Bradford Plumer, the fact that over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than how we vote now is stated. The Electoral College System is based on Americans voting for the electors that are the candidate's party. When Americans go to vote, they vote for electors who support the President and then the electors choose the president. When Americans go to vote, the banners should just say Vote For Electors. When Americans vote, it is made to seem as they are voting directly for the President they want to be elected. Instead, Americans are actually voting for electors. Multiple times you'll hear the saying, ""Every vote counts."" but really, every vote does not count. No matter how many times Americans vote for their President, the Electoral College has the final say no matter what American's votes are.

The major problem that worries many, is the problem of a tie in the electoral vote. During an election when a tie occurs, the state delegations vote for who will be president. According to the article The Indefensible Electoral College by Bradford Plumer, each state is able to cast one vote and the one single state representative makes the decision for the state. If the point of an election is for the people to vote and choose, there shouldn't even be a option for the one representative to choose. All the votes that were just cast by Americans all go down the drain now. In the case of a tie, all the power and weight goes to the one state representative to choose who becomes the president. The represtative does not care about what the people want, that representative will choose what they want to do with this election. According to Bradford Plummer, during the 2000 campaign, Rhode Island, South Carolina and fifteen other states did not even get to view media markets or campaigns and did not even get to see the candidates. Those states howeve still voted, not knowing anything about these candidates because overall the Electoral College makes the last call.

The Electoral College is an unfair process that also plays a big role in elections. No matter how Americans vote, the Electoral College is going to be the people who elect the president. Americans vote for who they want as their president but the Electoral College simply makes that decision for you. Americans shouldn't even vote, the Electoral College can make that decision. Many people in America simply want the popular vote than to have the process of Electoral College in place. We should all take a vote to abolish the Electoral College. But wait, the Electoral College might say no since they always make the overall decision.       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

Firstly, raising the minimum wage would reduce poverty. People who earn the minimum wage often have to work multiple jobs just to pay their bills, leaving them with little time to spend with their families or pursue their interests. By raising the minimum wage, these people would have more financial stability and would be able to focus on other aspects of their lives.

Secondly, a higher minimum wage would boost the economy. When people have more money to spend, they are more likely to buy goods and services, which in turn helps businesses to grow. This creates a cycle of economic growth that benefits everyone.

Finally, raising the minimum wage is simply the right thing to do. No one who works full time should have to live in poverty. By paying people a fair wage for their work, we can create a more just and equitable society.

Of course, some people argue against raising the minimum wage, claiming that it would lead to job losses or higher prices for consumers. However, studies have shown that these concerns are largely unfounded. In fact, many businesses have already raised their minimum wage voluntarily and have not experienced any negative effects.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the minimum wage should be raised in my country. It would help to reduce poverty, boost the economy, and create a more just society.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"The minimum wage is a contentious issue in many countries.

AF7D12A40305,"Imagine you're at home sick and you're stressed about all the work you're missing from school, worried about how left behind you'll be. Many students would benefit from distance learning or online classes. Technology has taken a huge toll on our lives today and helping students with their education makes a big difference. Distance learning would be beneficial for students since they would be more likely to do their work and on their own time, won't fall behind when they're absent, and will be able to learn the material better.

When at home, students are more likely to get things done and do they're work. Being in a noisy classroom with other students constantly talking can be distracting, especially when trying to learn. With being able to attend classes from home, you can get your classwork done on you're own time, making it beneficial when having other things to do throughout the day. Many students have sports or a job and are not able to be in a classroom for eight hours. Being able to do your school-work when you choose has a big impact. Students can also do their work in a setting where they can learn best. Whether if that's sitting in a library or in your bed, being in a environment where you feel most comfortable¬†in is important when getting things done.

Being absent from school can make a huge difference in your grades and cause you to fall behind in your classes. Online classes can change this. Students will be able to do their work from wherever they are. When students worry about missing school since they're absent, it can take a toll on¬†their school-work and cause unnecessary stress. If you're home sick with the flu or even out with your family on vacation, distance learning can change that by being able to feel like you're in the classroom and not falling behind with just the use of a computer.

Online classes and video conferencing with your teacher helps most students learn much better. With video conferencing, students feel like their one-on-one with their teacher and are able to focus more. Classrooms can often be distracting due to other students talking or noises around the school. However, distance learning changes this. Teachers also may not be going the pace of a students liking, causing the student to get frustrated and fall behind. With video conferencing, students will be able to rewind the video and go the pace they need in order to learn the material. Attending classes from home can have a great impact on a student's learning.

Distance learning can have a positive impact with student's education due to them being more likely to do their work on their own time in a setting where they prefer, being caught up on their work when absent, and being able to learn the curriculum at their own pace. Students will benefit from online classes and schools everywhere should have this option. Being able to attend classes from home is an advantage today that we should take. With only needing the use of a computer, being able to take classes online is a great advantage that would benefit the young minds of students today.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
FD099950BAEA,"What if, after summer ends, you lose all of what you've learned from the previous year? This is something that neither the students' teachers or families want to happen to them. To combat this, several schools require students to work on projects, given to them before the school year ends, and complete them to ensure that they continue to learn. The only real question now is, ""Should the projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?"" The answer to this question, based on what I believe, is that these summer projects should be designed specifically for the students. This is because that the students are the ones that doing the project, not the teachers; the projects should not be designed for teachers, because they are the ones who are helping the students to learn; lastly, students will more likely have more free time than teachers.

The first reason for why I believe that the summer projects should be student-designed is that the students are the ones that are doing the projects, not the teachers. This is because the whole purpose of the summer projects is to make sure that the students are continuing to learn, and there's also the fact that the teachers have already learned what they needed at school; therefore the summer projects should be student-designed.

The second reason for my decision is that the projects should not be designed for teachers, because they are the ones helping the students to learn. The point behind this is that even though each teacher teaches his or her students in their own way, their main objective is to help students gain the skills they need to succeed in college and adulthood. Therefore, it would be wierd if the summer projects were designed with teachers in mind.

The third and final reason as to why schools should design their summer project with students in mind is simply because students will more likely have more free time than teachers. Although the amount of free time for students may vary depending on their summer plans, teachers will have to focus on preparing for the next school year, leaving them with less free time than students.

Even though some people think that summer projects should be teacher-designed because the teachers are the ones that will give the projects to their students, and that it would be easier to categorize students, based on their classes, that's not guaranteed to be the best case. Because due to this project being for the students and not the teachers, and due to the possible, extra free time that the students will have during summer, I believe that should schools end up giving students projects over summer break, that they should be designed with the students in mind.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
BA14C47026ED,"Hey there,

I'm super stoked to share my thoughts on the proposed policy change that requires students to have at least a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities. As an 8th grader, I've got some strong feelings about this, and I'm gonna lay them out for ya.

First off, I think it's totally fair to have some kind of grade requirement for participating in extracurriculars. I mean, sports and activities are super important, but they shouldn't come before academic stuff. If you're not doing well in school, you're not gonna be able to do well in sports or activities, right? It's all about balance.

But, I don't think a B average is the right grade requirement. Like, what if you're really good at sports or activities, but you're not the best student? You could still be super dedicated and work hard, but if you don't have the best grades, you're gonna be stuck on the sidelines. That doesn't seem fair to me.

And what about students who are struggling in school? If they're not doing well, they might need to focus on their grades instead of sports or activities. By requiring a B average, they're gonna be missing out on important opportunities to improve their grades and get back on track.

Plus, there are tons of other ways to measure success in school. Grades aren't the only thing that matters. What about attendance? Behavior? Participation in class? I think those things are just as important as grades, and they shouldn't be ignored just because someone doesn't have a B average.

I also think this policy change could have a negative effect on school spirit and community. If students are only allowed to participate in sports or activities if they have good grades, it's gonna make it harder for them to get involved and be a part of the school community. And that's not cool.

In conclusion, while I can see why the policy change was proposed, I don't think it's the right way to go. I think it's important to find a balance between academic and extracurricular stuff, but requiring a B average is too strict",1,llama2_chat,Task: Students are asked to provide feedback and explain why they agree or disagree with the proposed policy change that students must have at least a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities.

47228B569E22,"Would you ask more then one person for advice ? If so why would you ? Because on my opinion I think that it would be good to ask other people for their advice on something , because some people could give you different advice , they can help you pick rather or not you should do something , and also you can see who are the people that are willing to help you with some good advice.

Now I would like to talk about why it would be good to get advice from multiple people. I think it is good because I have had a moment when I did not know if I should still be friends with someone I knew had talked behind my back so I started to ask some friend and family members to see what they think about it . Now know they where completely honest with me , so one of my family members told me if what she said hurt me in any type of way then to just stop talking to her. So then I kept asking and they kept giving me different advice , so what I did was I put everything together and it all added up in a way so that is how I got my answer to what I should do. That is why it is good to ask different people for advice because some could give you the same advice and some wont . Now some advice can be good but some are not always good. And it is good to get advice because when you are about to do something you wont have to worry that you are going to do something bad because if the person that you talked to gave you good advice you dont have to worry.

Why is it good to know other peoples opinion? Let me tell you why it is good to know , because if you tell them something then of course they will stop and think then be like you should not do that because you could hurt your self , nor you can hurt the other person. Because then they would tell you why it is a good idea and why it is not. I have been in a situation like that as well where I wanted to do something so i just wanted to make sure that what I was about to do would not hurt any one in any type of way so my cousin started to give me reasons to why I should not do it . I ended up listening to her but then I realized that if I never asked her if it was a good idea I would have made a huge mistake. And that is what I want you to notice that if you are about to do somewhere rather it is to your self or someone else try talking to someone ,and ask them for advice because really it could help. And they can all make sure that you and everyone else are okay. So really knowing other peoples opinion really just a good choice to make because it is helping you.

Now this one is my favorite. Witch is that asking for advice lets you see who are the true friends that are acutely willing to give you advice , and good advice not bad . Because people always have that one friend that is willing to help but not help you in a good way more like in a bad way , because most times let me start of small you ask them a question "" oh does this one look good on me or that one"" and they will answer back with the one they think looks ugly and you know they are picking the ugly one but you just pick not to say anything. Now let me go big if you ask them for advice on something serious they will tell you oh yeah you should do it because it wont harm anyone , but no they just want to put lies in your head so that when people with actual good advice come you will be confused and not know what to do. So it is better to know when a friend is just lying to you because you want a friend that tells you the truth and that you can trust with really anything and you know that their advice wont be bad. Also when you ask any one in particular for advice know that people are not always right so every time you need to make a decision and need advice go with what your head tells you to not always with what other people tell you .

So really that is what I think could help people notice that asking different people for advice is really help full because when you get different ideas from multiple people you have a lot of choices and you get to pick the best one out of all the choices you got but of course you would know rather or not what they told you was good and helpful because if it was not then obviously do not use it. But really my point here is if you ask more then one person for help it can really help you out , because imagine you where going to do something and a part of you is saying dont do it but the other part of you is saying you should do it . Then of course you will need someone to give you advice to what you should do because if it was something bad then that would not be good . So really it is best to just ask someone for their opinion. Because it is always better to do something when someone tells you that it is okay then always doing things by yourself and end up ruining something. So real question here is would you ever ask for someone else opinion?¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,4
E032A417EBD1,"Classroom learning is seen as the standard for public education, but soon, this could change. Distanced learning is a schooling option that most overlook due to its abnormality, yet this fairly new type of education could transform the lives of many. The idea of sitting in a classroom with at least twenty other students isnt the most helpful type of learning for a multitude of students. Those that argue this type of schooling makes it harder for growing children to develop important social skills, fail to realize that this is not the best/only option for every student. Distanced education is extremely beneficial to an array of students due to its flexibility and isolated setting.

Attendance is something that holds large amounts of students back from graduation, yet frequently missing school isnt a choice for some students. Often times teenagers with physical and or mental illnesses are required to miss school as a result of their doctor/therapy appointments. These students are then plagued with stress, when they could be utilizing that time to focus on themselves and recover to return to a ""normal"" school schedule as soon as possible. Online courses move at the students speed, and makes it so that one can continue at their own pace and pick up when its most convenient for them. The common school schedule (seven to three) doesnt consider what is best for these type of students, and forces this non-negotiable time slot on them. On the other hand, online education creates a flexible and customizible schedule that works with all.

Anxiety is a type of mental illness that causes constant worrying, and sadly it affects an alarming number of high school students. The students that are cursed with this illness are not found to strive in the ""normal"" classroom setting. If alternative types of learning were made more common and accessible, unnecessary anxiety and worsened mental health could be easily avoided. Isolated learning¬†makes the education experience less stressful and much easier to manage for those who struggle with mental illness, and even those who just prefer one on one learning. Isolated settings dont work with every student, and this is why it is not the only option.

Distanced education is tremendously beneficial to a variety of students due to its flexibility and more comfortable setting. This type of education is not the only kind available to students, it is an alternative type for those that could benefit from it (as many can). Preferably, distanced learning would not be a permanent solution yet one that could be appreciated in its time of need. Many students would benefit immensely from this type of education as it has the ability to work with all different types of students and all different types of situations. Despite the benefits, this type of schooling would only be utilized when necessary. Think about the amount of students that could find success with this alternative kind of education, why would this idea not be considered?",0,persuade_corpus,,9
3ABC3C461EE1,"Have you ever been in a situation and thought to yourself, ""aw man, I wish I could get another persons advice on this right now."" Most people think that they know what is best for them. But what they don't realize, is that most of the time they are wrong. Studies show that having multiple peoples advice is far more helpful and effective than getting your own or only one persons advice. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a wiser choice by learning from other peoples experiences, having a slimmer chance of making a mistake, and learning how to ask for help and advice for the future.

There are countless advantages from receiving other peoples advice. One advantage is that you will learn from other peoples experiences and have a better understanding of what you should do. For example, if you were thinking about taking all honors classes in high school, and you thought it was the right decision for you, you should still consider getting more than one opinion about your decision. Multiple viewpoints you could consider could be your parents, counselors at your school, an older sibling, or a trusted adult. These other viewpoints could say that all honors is too hard, or that you would be too stressed. But by having multiple opinions, you will be able to make the right decision for you.

In addition, by seeking multiple opinions you will have a slimmer chance of making a mistake. If you seek more than one person for advice, then you will learn what to do, and what to avoid. For example, if you asked your parents to buy you a vape pen because everyone at school was doing it, your parents and anyone else you asked would most likely respond by saying no. They would inform you on how risky and bad vape pens are, and advise you to never participate in that behavior. By them advising you how bad vaping is, then you would take into account their advice and not vape, thus dodging a bullet of cancer and an abundant amount of other health issues. When having advice on why vaping is bad, it will cause you to make a better choice, limiting chances of making a mistake that can hinder your future.

Lastly, when getting multiple viewpoints on a decision or issue, it will allow you to be more comfortable with asking for help and advice, which can lead to a successful future. Asking questions and talking to people is always a good thing, especially when it comes to advice and opinions. If you don't feel comfortable with asking for advice or opinions, then you may not be able to make good choices, which could result in bad decision making later in life. For example, if your friend asked you to smuggle some drugs into school with him and you didn't get any advice or talk to anyone, then you wouldn't hesitate to help him. This could result in a lifetime of drug problems, which could resolve in going to jail.

In conclusion, asking for more than one persons opinion is successful for making better decisions by allowing you to get other peoples advice and point of views on your decision, having less of a chance to make mistakes, and making you more comfortable with asking questions. Getting other peoples advice and opinions is far more effective than relying on one persons, because you can see multiple point of views, which will allow you to make the best decision for you. When receiving multiple opinions, it results in a smaller chance of making mistakes, which can prevent future problems and issues in life. And lastly, by learning to ask for advice and help, it allows you to be more comfortable with other peoples views and opinions, which can help you be successful later in life. So next time you are ever in a situation that requires advice, you may want to consider having more than one persons opinion.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,1

With the recent outbreak of the corona virus¬†many counties where it has a presence¬†have closed putting a halt on classes. However, with the option of online classes student can continue to learn with schools closed. I have three cousins who live in Washington state near Generic_City. A student in there school happened to test positive for the corona virus forcing the schools to close for two weeks. The students were assigned online courses and a specific time requirement to meet each day on there classes. And this doesn't have to be for a pandemic like the corona virus, student can simply miss a couple days due too a cold and not fall behind on their work. Or have a sporting event which they would have to miss school for. With the option of online learning students can learn while being outside the classroom and not fall behind.

Student wishing to add more classes to their schedule can also¬†take online classes. I have many friends who attend the Generic_School¬†which takes up an entire day of there schedule giving them four less classes. Some of those classes are required for graduation such as economics and personal finance. Those friends are currently taking those classes online and I have had the chance to talk to them about it over the course of the year, They said while it is sometimes hard to be able to focus taking at classes at home it's much better than the alternative of taking a summer course. Periodic unit test for those classes keep them on track of where they need to be in the class.

Online classes also give students the option of learning at their own pace. Instead of a teacher jumping from next question to next question to the next, students can take there time on each problem, unit, or subject. Whether¬†it be derivatives in calculus, commas in English, or balancing equations¬†in chemistry; student can take as much time as necessary for them to understand the content at hand. This also goes the other way around, student who are advanced can learn at an accelerated rate getting more in depth¬†to the content and better preparing them selves for test like an AP exam, SAT, or ACT.

In conclusion, the benefits of online classes heavily out way the cons of the option of distance learning. I'm not saying to get rid of regular school, but the option of an alternative method of learning can only help students. Whether it be because a student missed class because they were sick, they can take an online class for the subject he/she missed.

8F4B595CF9E7,"Do you ever want more opinions and options when it comes to advice? Well you can! You can simply ask more than one person for their opinion so you can choose yours! It is good to go to multiple sources for opinions, because it opens your mind up to new things, you can get good or bad feed back, and you can now see things from different points of views.

Seeking for more opinions can open your mind up for new and different things. This can help you think outside the box and form new thoughts on a situation. Thinking outside the¬†box can help you be more creative and have a different/new look on your problem. You can also ask advice from new people or people you normally wouldnt ask advice from. By doing this you could solve your problem/situation with new and different things that this person could help you find. Lastly, knowing how to ask multiple people for advice can help you later in life. This can be helpful when you have to work with others in a job, and you need to understand that you are not the only one with good ideas, and you need to know that asking for help is a good thing that can make whatever you are working on even better with even more minds. Therefor asking many people for advice can help your mind open up for new and different things.

You can see things from different points of views. You can get a better understanding of that person. By this I mean you can see their perspectives, and can maybe get to know them more based off their advice. The person that is giving you advice could have gone through similar situations. If they have been through something similar then they could have good advice on it and what you should or should not do, and the right way of taking care of the situation. The person giving you advice could have also been through different things. But this can still help when receiving advice because they will see things different, and having a completely different mind from yours can still be good and helpful. Overall, you should always try and see things from different points of views.

You can also be open to feedback by asking peers for their opinions. This can help cancel somethings out when the advice is given, and can cancel out the bad ideas for whatever the advice is needed for. Canceling out ideas is a good strategy when needing advice or opinions so you can separate the good from the bad in the situation. Feedback can come in good or bad ways like constructive criticism. For example someone could give good advice that the person may not want hear, but they still should to be open to it. Some people may have their mind already made up about their conflict/situation, and just may want some extra thoughts. That is why feedback is good because it is small and you are still making the decision for your self, just with commentary of others. As you can see feedback is a good strategy when needing advice from others.

Seeking out multiple people for good advice is a good strategy. This is because it makes it easy to cancel out bad ideas, to collect feedback, and to have a more open mind to new things. Therefor seeking different sources for advice is very useful.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

61A0FEA827E4,"Greetings ,my name is Generic_Name. I go to Generic_School and I'm a junior this year. I was just recenlty informed that some schools require students to complete a summer project in order for thme to contiue to learn. But now the questions arises, should said projects be student designed or should the teachers design it? Although some would say teacher designed projects are better because the teachers have an understanding in the topic and can provide accurate deatils for better clarity. Actually I believe student designed projects are better because students could develop working enviroment skills and could make it relativly easy.

By a show of hands who likes summer... because i sure do. Shouldnt summer be a time spent learning or accomplishing other activitys like learning to drive, learning to bake or even learning to maintain a source of income. Student designed projects would be easy and short something that could be done in a short time spand.

Not something that requires me to look up, double check for accuracy, cite sources, revise,noodletools, and then hope I dont forget about it or lose it. Students know students best, plus it could develop skills for future planning because of course not all of them are going to be the same, some will be easy and others more challenging it can be a brand new experience for the students to design and for the teachers to look upon their ideas.

Another side to look at is if a teacher designs a project soley online. What if i go to a place with no internet? How am i suppose to do so if i cant access the document? Well theres nothing i can really do but, if students design a number of different projects some could be on papar and others online that way I could get options on what I'd be ok doing. For example some could be just to ""read a book""

or some could even be creative like ""draw a place you visited while over the break"". Point is students have a greater imagination than teachers in most aspects and could make a varity or projects and not just stick to the same one for everyone.

Now for a story. In my entire life ive only had one summer project and it was back in middle school. The goal was to just read a chapter book and then to write about it. That year i had read all 6 of the star wars books from ""Phantom Menace"" to ""The Jedi Return"". But i decided to write about ""Revenge of The Sith"" which is my favorite book/movie from the prequel era. I honeslty didnt know how to start the writing ,as a surpirse to no one I was and still am a pretty weak writer. But eventually I came around to write about Anakins insecuritys and the fact no one was honestly there to help him through his dark time and that it consumed him even making him hurt the ones he loved. Now keep in mind I had finished about a week into summer so I was pretty much free to do what I wanted. That same summer I had traveled to Honduras for 2 and a half months to visit.

However, it can also lead to stress, anxiety, and lack of sleep for students. For teachers, a school day of 8.5 hours provides more time for lesson planning and preparation, but it can also lead to an increased workload and feeling of burnout.

You should take Policy 1 because we work hard in school and we would love a little free time and put them away when we are in class or in the hall ways. Policy 1 is better for us because we have some thing to do on our lunch. Policy 2 is not good for us because if we are in class we cant focus because all we are thinking about is our phone and how we cant wait to use it. If we have policy 1 we could focus better and class and do our work better then when we have our break we wont be thinking about using our phone. But I kind of disagree because if we have our break and we are done with using our phone some people disobey the teacher and use their phones in class or when they are suppose to put their phones in their locker use them during any time the teacher is not looking so I kind of agree with Policy 2. I think you should pick Policy 2 because I could not stand not using my phone for more than 6 hours.

In my opinion, I think that the school cell phone policy should get changed to the second policy that states ""do not allow students to have cell phones at school at all"". I think this because the students could still use their phones even if the rules say to have them turned off. I don't think just having your phone turned off will stop you from using it later on during class. When students are not aloud to have them at school for whatever reason, it can prevent the students from getting distracted during class because of texting during class or study hall while you can be doing extra credit work. Their is also downfall's that include the students needing to call for a ride if their parent didn't come to pick them up or not knowing if their parent is working overtime and needs to pickup someone else. No matter what I would still pick the second policy because their are more pros than cons.

This model come from a system of some businesses have adopted to conserve energy and resources, this model can help student get more involvev in their apprenticesship and school's activities.

This idea can help stueden but it have disadvantages is well, because there will be some students that will take a lot of time to be in the habit because they were accustomed to the normal school day. Also some students have to work after school, this meas if they stay at the school more time, it will less time that they will have to make work's hours, but this dosen't affect them to much, because they will attend to the school only four day in a week. This is graet because they will have a long weeked to make their tasks and work and help their parents at home with the home's jod. One reasons why our school should follow this model is the creations of new classes like: workshop , drama, and stodios of art . Student can be involvev in every kind of activity to spend their time in something that will help them in their future. Everyone can join up to any program at the school like ORTC this is a great program for some student that are thinking about join up to some militar's branchs, as we know the military can give you many benefits really good, with this program they will get a rich knowledge about it.

Many peoples will disagree with this new model of extending the school day two hours because some of them dosen't like the school already. Also some parents can be disagree because they think that the students doesn't need that much time at the school that's why the school should make a specific schedule, addding more breaks and activities and then, they will realize that this model of extending the school day two hour will be good, and then student will take advantage of time that they will have to learn more.

In example we have a groups of society as we know like some businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resources. That way the worker have a extra day that can be spend with another work and they are available to have a second jod. This can help them get a better financial life or take that extra time to esped it with their families.

F5D2D8C81370,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that allowing cellphones in school has both pros and cons that need to be considered. While cellphones can be a useful tool for communication and organization, they can also be a source of distraction and a violation of student trust.

One of the main advantages of allowing cellphones in school is that they can be used for communication purposes. For example, students can use their cellphones to communicate with their teachers or parents in case of an emergency. Additionally, cellphones can be used to organize schedules and assignments, which can help students stay on top of their work.

However, cellphones can also be a source of distraction in the classroom. Students may use their cellphones to browse social media, play games, or text their friends instead of paying attention to their teachers. This can lead to a decrease in student engagement and a decrease in academic performance.

Another potential issue with allowing cellphones in school is that it can violate student trust. Teachers rely on their students to be honest and trustworthy, and if students are allowed to use their cellphones in class, it can be difficult to monitor their behavior and ensure that they are not cheating or using their phones for inappropriate purposes.

In addition to these concerns, allowing cellphones in school can also have other impacts on students. For example, it can create a digital divide between students who have access to cellphones and those who do not. This can lead to a sense of unfairness and a disadvantage for students who do not have access to these devices.

In conclusion, while there are certainly benefits to allowing cellphones in school, there are also potential drawbacks that need to be considered. As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is important for schools to carefully weigh the pros and cons of allowing cellphones in the classroom and to take steps to minimize any negative impacts. This may include implementing policies to limit the use of cellphones during class, providing support for students who do not have access to these devices, and ensuring that students are held accountable for their behavior while using their cellphones.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,4

Also, if the person does make a mistake they should be able to unelect them also cause people need what is best for are country.

When people elect the president they usally go back through there speaches and see what they had promised for our country and make sure it is what they want. If it is not what they want they would probably go to the next person who is trying to be the president. When you are electing always make sure you are mking the right decision and make sure that they please you because they could elect that person because of yur vote you never no what could happen when voting.

Everywhere you go what do you see, you see your everyday family walking around with smartphones, or a businessman on a call for a meeting with a phone, but why do people do that while driving. All across the nation people everyday are using their cell phones while driving and causing more traffic collisions in the past decade or so then compared to drunk driving accidents. People should not be using a cell phone while driving because its a major distraction for the driver and can cause someone to get hurt or even killed. If today, you walked into a normal public high school and go into a class, you would see a lot of students sitting bored and playing on sometime of phone or device. Now imagine that person doing the same thing when driving, hard to imagine but a lot of the accidents that occur when people or using a cell phone is caused by teenagers and young adults.

Many states such as Georgia in the U.S. have implemented a law which requires its people to drive hands free which means if you are caught driving with a phone in hand, you will be punished with a hefty fine or jail time. A study was set in place to determine the rate of increase on cell phone related crashes each year and the number is a shocking 1.6 Million crashes and of that, 390,000 are either injured or killed. Cell phone related crashes are the number one causes of death inside the U.S's borders for the past 10 years and needs to be solved fast. The best way to regulate and control this dilemma is by implementing a law similar to Georgia's hands free law to every state to ensure that no one will drive and use a cell phone.

The only instance to which a person should be using a cell phone while driving should be by law enforcement or if you are a passenger in the vehicle. The driver needs to focus on the road at all times to ensure that his/her passengers or even just him/herself arrives to their destination on time. Even when a driver is not using a cell phone, they are still distracted by a passenger even when they are trying to show the driver something on another phone and cause an accident. The driver has only one job and is to keep all souls in a vehicle safe and secure at all times and should not be distracted.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
A222836421FE,"What do you do when you need advice? Many people tend to ask others such as their friends, family, teachers, etc. The real question is, should you ask only one person for advice or multiple people? Asking multiple people for their opinions can help you make a better choice as people have different views and beliefs, personal experience in what you want advice for, and you have different people telling you their opinion so you can consider the best option.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, because many people have different views and beliefs. Nobody is the same, and the world is a very diverse place. Many people are biased, and if you were to ask somebody who is biased for advice, they would give you their personal opinion which could be on the far right or far left of the spectrum. Everybody was raised different. Some grew up in poverty, some rich, and some in segregated communities. The way you were brought up is also a factor to your opinions and asking just one person may affect your decision based on their opinion.

The topic you need advice on may have also happened to other people. People have personal experience in some of the same topics, and that's why it's good to seek multiple opinions. Tragic events happen to people everyday, and that's a factor in what can affect people's opinions. For example, women who have had a baby may have a different opinion than a childless woman. People are also very educated. If you needed advice on a medical topic, it would be best to go see someone who has a degree and is experienced in the field. If you were to go to your friend who self-treated them self,¬†he or she may tell you something completely different than an experienced person in the medical field may tell you.

Multiple people telling you their opinions gives you a wide range of options to consider as they all have gone through different things in life. If it's a personal topic, it's best to ask many different people from different races, religions, and others as you'll hear many different opinions and maybe even hear something you've never thought about that you may consider.

Overall, it's best to ask multiple different people their opinions on a topic you need advice on. By doing that, you'll hear many different opinions and it'll give you a long list of options to consider as you are hearing opinions from people with different views and beliefs, personal experience, and from people who may be completely different than you.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

Second,i think that science experiments could be enjoyable because you can do the science experiment with your friends. If you do it with your friends you can have fun. You could have time to talk to them about the science experiment that your doing, Also you could work together on it and get a good grade.

It says that the driver may have to start driving if a work area is up ahead. People may take advantages of them and they will be either asleep or they will be busy on their phone. It would be very difficult to pay attention and have to drive some if your sleeping. People are on their phones now when they actually driving. They are going to be on their phones even more and not paying attention.

Another thing that i think of is wrecks. If the cars do wreck how do you know whos fault it is with a car that has no driver. There would be many people that can be blamed for the accident. Like it said in the passage you dont know either to blame the car company or the driver that isnt driving.

It would be extremely difficult to have all these cars on a grid. they would all have to be on a grid so other driverless cars would know when to stop and turn. all of the cars would have to be programed to the same grid. That could be extremly difficult to have all of them in order and no glitches happen.

Then on top of everything the people that cannot afford the car will still have the cars we have today. If there is still cars on the road we have today then they would also have to programed to the grid with the driverless cars. That could be very expensive and not all people have the money to afford this.

AD083E05BDC9,"Though some may argue that the Face is alien made I belive I can prove them wrong. There have been many theories many are just based on others opinions instead of actual facts. So, how can we the scientist be right well, it's simple you use research.

Though I am on the side that the Face is just a land formation I can start to see the theorists point. In the begging yes it was some what unclear. Because theorists gave reasons to belive we couldn't see only because it was a cloudy time as said in paragraph 8. Also, it's hard to forget or just drop something as big as this which lasted 25 years. The Face was a highlight to a dull world it gave some people reason to believe that we are not alone and that event sparked so many other theories. But, never the less these theorists certinally need to get a day job and just quite while their ahead.

Now, that we have delved into the side that most don't join. I'd like to talk about why the Face should just be forgoten. When Viking 1 had been sent up in May of 2001 we along with theorists were curious about what was found. But with careful examination we were able to see it was nothng out of the ordinary. In paragraph 3 we had described it as "" as a huge rock formation with shadow that gave th illusion of a human face. In which case meant we had nothing to hide although some beg to differ. But, with some still demanding we have a closer look we had finally agreed.

In our case it was not an easy as stated in paragraph 9 '' cydonia is not easy to target."" Nevertheless we had acomplished our task and gave the people what they wanted. We had even had the technology to show everthing that could be seen on there. And of cousre NASA is stil correct becausce nothing was found just a rock that looked like a face. To compare it we had said""

its is equivalnt to a mesa or the Middle Butte in the American west.""

The student's would also get a feel of how other student's our in they might even make a new freind's.

I agree because I think student's do not get enough exercise. If student's got enough exercise it would be more athleyt's. It would be more student's outside playing all types of sport's. They would be able to breath better than other poeple that do not like to exercise. In if student's do not get enough exercise they would not be able to leave a nice long life.

I think it is good for student's to exercise if all student's exercise they would leave a long healthy life. In if you leave a long life you be able to see the world in travel. But if you do not want to take care of your body you would not leave a long nice life. Like for example you would have to go threw alot to try to leave a healthy life. But if you do you would be able to complete your life long dream.

For the year books you would have to type poeple names. In the rason I think that is good is because the student's can get to laern new student's.

0202ddf9,"The Electoral College has been kept for centuries, established by the founding fathers and established in the Constitution. I think that the process should be maintained so far, it has worked fine and I do not see any reason to rid of it. The Electoral College should be continued in use because there are at least five main scenarios in which it is helpful and reasonable.

In ways, the Electoral College could be dangerous to use unless you have electors that are completely faithful in their party, and do not take advantage of getting to choose where to place their vote. Basically, voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then elect the president. These electors can go against the people's majority votes and decide who to vote for. It could also be possible that a state sends two slates of electors to elect. If the election was a direct vote, there would be almost no chance for a tie to happen, but with the Electoral College, there is always that possibility. Some states do not even see the candidates because of the majority of the people living there belong to a single party, and the ""winnertakesall"" system completely affects this. If the election were to be a direct vote, the candidates might visit the states in order to gather as many votes as possible. However, many of these reasons that the Electoral college should be abolished are just one time things, so consider the other side of the argument.

Swing states basically decide the election and therefore, they are the most thoughtful voters. They know that they will be the ones to decide the election, so they pay more attention to the news, and the candidates campaigns. The swing states receive the most information and attention from the candidates. Since they will end up deciding, the candidates want them on their side. Many states are already predicted, even before the election, as a majority of them are from one party. These voters think the most about who they want to run our country and who will do the best in that position, so they should be granted the honor of making the decision.

Electoral votes help avoid runoff elections, by reducing the pressure that might complicate the election. Say that our government referred to the direct vote system, with a lesser system known as the Electoral College was for comparison, and during the presidential election, there happened to be a problem with the popular votes versus the Electoral College this complication could be avoided if we used the Electoral College. This has happened with nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, when they both had only a 43 plurality of the popular votes but were winning in the Electoral College.

The Electoral College could be unwanted by many minority voters in states that leaned completely one way. These voters hardly pay attention during the campaign because they know that their vote will hardly make a diffference in their state, but a voter's vote could not swing a complete election, and not the full population voted in the 2012 election. Voters usually just like to express their preference and have it known than decide the vote that will make an election. It is more likely that your vote will count if you are educated in the happenings of the government, and maybe your vote can make a difference.",0,train_essays,,1
43612C840EE7,"Dear state senator,

I think that we should keep the Electoral College. By keeping the Electoral College, there will be no problems in elections to where no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The process is like a ""winner-take-all"" system. In the Electoral College a presidental candidate must have trans-regional appeal.

To begin, there are run-off elections. Run-off elections will make sure that no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electorial College will help make it clearer to see which candidate is the winner. For an example in 1992 Clinton had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, then won a majority in the Electoral College.

Next, the Electoral College has a ""winner-take-all"" process. States such as Florida (29), Texas (38) and California (55) have a high amount of electoral votes. If there was a tie between two candidates and the votes from Florida were not put in yet, one of the candidates has a better chance of winning. Most candidates will try to persuade and win the higher states votes so that they will have a better chance of winninig. What's nice about the Electoral College, it causes the toss-up states to pay close attention the the campaign.

Finally, every candidate running for office must have a trans-regional appeal. None of the regions in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect the new president. When a canidate goes and campains in one region without thinking about he will not gain his electoral votes. Normally a candidate that has only regional appeal will be unlikely to be a successful president.

To conclude, the choice of keeping the Electoral College would very very wise and helpful. The Electoral College makes sure that there are run-off elections, it has a ""winner-take-all"" system, and that every canidadte running should be trans-regional. Even though in the Electoral College is not democratic and that only a slate of electors vote, a decent amount of times of when the people would pick that one candidate the electors would pick the same one.

For instance, Generic_Name will not have to design and do the project. Since the teacher is designing the project Generic_Name will not have to worry about that. She can focus on just doing the project. Summer projects should be teacher designed because students know what teachers are looking for. For instance, the students has had many projects before in Mr. Generic_Name's class. Since the teacher is designing the project the students know what he is looking for. Summer projects should be teacher designed so that the students can get the project done faster. For example, Since Mr. Generic_Name already designed the project all Generic_Name has to do is do the project which saves her a lot of time. Doing just the project is faster than having to design it and do the project.

Even though some believe summer projects must be student designed it should be known, summer projects need to be teacher designed. The opposition incorrectly believes summer projects should be student designed because students will learn work ethic and possibly find hidden talents. Summer projects should be teacher designed because of benefits to teachers such as planning ahead, projects being easier to grade, and not having to worry about students doing the wrong things.

""...it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar sytem.""If this is true then why is it so dangerous now? Why can people live in Venus and Earth? Venus stil has features that are just like Earth. For example,""...surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys,moutains,and craters....recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit..""

""...researchers cannot take samples of rock,gas,or anything else from a distance....would need yo get up close and personal despite the risks. or maybe we should think of them as challenges.""If the reacherers can't take some samples of the real life object how can we reallt test them the right way and ger correct information about them. If they can get information then we wonr ever know if som say we would be able to have life on another planet.

Could you imagine being on another taking picture to remember exactaly how things were? Well keep using you imagination just like the scientists.""Modern computures are enormously powerful,flexible,and quick,but tend to be more delicate when is comems to extreme physical conditons. Just imagine exposing a cel phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin.""Would your pictures even ,make it back to earth?

Due to th high pressure and heat,erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface, most things wouldnt survie on Venus. You could bake to death over there. Everything would melt. It is to dangeous to explore on Venus but we can all hope one day that it would be safe enough for good research on that planet ""Earth's twin"".",0,persuade_corpus,,4
llama_70b_v172,"Single-use plastics are a big problem. They are hurting our environment and we need to do sumthin about it. I think we should ban them.

First of all, single-use plastics are not biodegradable. They don't break down and instead, they just pile up in landfills and oceans. This is causing a lot of problems for animals and pollution. For example, sea turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them, which can kill them. And when plastic breaks down into smaller pieces, it gets into the food chain and we end up eating it. Gross!

Another reason we should ban single-use plastics is that they are made from non-renewable resources. We are using up all our oil to make plastic bags and straws that we only use once. This is not sustainable and it's contributing to climate change.

Furthermore, single-use plastics are not necessary. We can use reusable bags, water bottles, and straws instead. It's easy to bring your own bag to the grocery store or use a refillable water bottle. And, did you know that straws are not even necessary? You can drink without them!

Some people might argue that single-use plastics are convenient, but I think it's not worth the harm they cause. We need to think about the future and take action now.

In conclusion, single-use plastics are bad news and we should ban them. We need to take care of our planet and stop using plastics that are hurting our environment. Let's make a change and use reusable products instead. It's time to say goodbye to single-use plastics!",1,llama_70b_v1,"The use of single-use plastic products has become a controversial topic due to its impacts on the environment.

F0E76CC2EF7A,"Hey there!  So, for this essay, we gotta research and write about whether students should be forced to participate in extracurricular activities. Like, I know some people might be like, ""Yaaas, totes yes!"" and others might be like, ""Ugh, no way, it's so lame!"" So, I'm gonna give my thoughts on the issue.

First off, let's talk about the pros of mandatory extracurriculars. Some people say that it's important for students to have a balance in their lives, you know? Like, school is super important, but so is having fun and doing stuff that makes you happy. Extracurriculars can help you find your passion and make new friends who share your interests. Plus, they look good on college apps, so it's like, a win-win.

But, on the other hand, some people think it's not fair to force kids to do stuff they don't want to do. Like, what if a student doesn't like sports or music? They should have the right to choose what they want to do with their time, you know? And, let's be real, sometimes extracurriculars can be super time-consuming and stressful. If you're already feeling overwhelmed with school work and stuff, adding in more activities can be, like, totally draining.

So, in my opinion, I think it's important for students to have the option to participate in extracurriculars, but it shouldn't be mandatory. Like, if a student wants to join a club or sport, that's great, but they shouldn't have to do it if they don't want to. It's all about balance and finding what works for each individual student.

In conclusion, mandatory extracurriculars can be beneficial, but it's important to consider the opinions of students and find a balance that works for everyone.  So, what do you think? Do you think students should be forced to participate in extracurriculars, or should it be optional?

DC29C39CC3E4,"In the excerpt the author talks about how even though going to venus will be a challenging journey it will aslo be a meaningful one. Through paragraphs 1-8 he paints a perfect picture of what NASA's has tried to do and what they are currently doing. He starts by explaining that yes, the living conditons on Venus are not ideal but they are survivable. Through the previous voyages to Venus, they have been able to establish that Venus is not a stable enough planet for them to completely land advanced technology there yet. The author tells us that in the past NASA has sent rovers and stuff up to the surface of Venus to get us a better view of our galaxies ""evening star''.

But within hours the space craft was lost and in a way killed due to the harsh conditions on Venus. Taking all that into consideration, NASA is planning on devising a better plan to rediscover and reexplore Venus. They are brainstorming on a way to make a device that can hover 30 or so miles above the surface of Venus. That distance will be the equivalant to jets and commercial airplanes flying over storms here on earth. The author succesfully persuaded me to believe Venus is worth exploring after reading this excerpt.

He did so by descriptively creating a scene in my head of Venus being Earth's equal. He talks about there being valleys, hills, and craters on Venus's surface just like they are here on Earth. He also goes into detail about how there is a strong possability that long ago Venus could have been covered in water that could have supported various life. There is also a strong possibility that if Venus can support our earth needs, then it could possibly be supporting someone elses. With further research and explorations we could find out if there truly is other life forms other than us.

In conclusion, Venus is worth going back to and doing a deeper investigation of what the planet really can do. I do believe that if anything would happen to earth it would be in our best bet to be able to flee to Venus. The author did a amazing job of supporting the idea of conducting better research on Venus by painting a vivid image into my head. Through his use of words and use of back story, he helps show that with enough motivation and dedication. We can transform Venus and its rough planetary conditons into another Earth.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
497b9797,"Dear, Senator There are many ways in keeping the change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States instead of keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a difficult process to go through. The Electoral College consists of the electors, where they vote for the President and the Vice President and also the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Electoral College is unfair, outdated to the voters, by using the election by popular votes for the president of the United States is fair to voters because they get to choose the person to run the office for four years.

To begin with, in favor keeping the change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is very helpful for the voters to vote easily to choose and listen to the candidates to see who will be great to the world. In source 3: ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner in paragraph 20 states, ""Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decided the election"". What this quote is trying to say that letting the voters choose and listen to the candidates very carefully to decide on the election, who will be helpful. Letting voters vote are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and that they will received the most information and attention from the candidates. By arguing keeping the popular votes for the president of the united States is very fair to the voters.

Furthermore, the people such as the voters help choose the state's electors when you are voting for the President. For example, in source 1: ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the federal Register in paragraph 6 say, ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This quote explains that the voters get to choose the President but it's actually voting for the candidate's electors. It's more easier keeping the popular vote for the president of Unites States instead of keeping the Electoral College because its a difficult process to go through.

Its true that election by popular vote for the president of United States is a good argument for the voters to choose wisley. As this can be seen as in source 2: ""The Indfensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer in paragraph 9 states, ""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" For example, in the 2000 U.S presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election by receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 226. By keeping the popular vote for the President of the United States is more easier for the society instead of using the Electoral College.

In Conclusion, why keep the Electoral College, when you can you use the popular vote.

So by keeping the popular votes is useful to let these people vote on who they want to choose. So by other people perspective, you should keep the popular votes.

97A05BD1708D,"My principal, Mr. Generic_Name, has just announced that all students are required to participate in one activity around the school. I think that is is a great idea for Middle and Elementary school! But some of the students don't like the idea as much. I agree with my principal's decision to require at least one extracurricular¬†activity. Whether it's encouraging students to learn something new that they like, getting to know others and making friends, or to spark a new hobby/interest. Here are my reasons and elaboration as to why I think this.

My first reason is that some of your time in Middle School should be spent doing something that you enjoy learning. The Loudoun Times have written about other schools doing the same change as what Mr. Generic_Name just announced. A writer for the Loudoun Times interviewed students at one school and 1 out of 5 students interviewed didn't like the idea at first, but when the interview happened again in the middle of the school year, that ratio changed to 4 out of 5.

Another reason why at least one extra curricular activity is good, is that you get to know others and make friends! CBS reported on a camp that was held in the Summer for exactly one week, which had kids aged 11 to 14 from 10am to 7pm, with 23 kids total, and activities of hiking, four square, camping, and more. All of the students except one had reported making at least one friends that they, later on in the camp, gave contact information to. I know this isn't in a school setting, but this proves that students can be the same way when doing a fun activity that they signed up for. If you like Tennis for example, you can play with other people in Tennis that share the same interest.

The last sentence brings me to my next reason, which is sparking a new hobby/interest. The University of Virginia had 20 8th graders choose something new to learn. The options were, Guitar, Tennis, and Basketball. 16 out of 20 8th graders liked what they chose. The next day, having all of the 20 8th graders either choose something new, or choose something different, 13 out of 20 choose the same option that they chose yesterday. One student when interviewed, said that he liked Guitar and hoped he could learn more about it in the future. That one student probably now has a new interest of Guitar as well as the other students who chose their activity for both of the two days. The people who chose the activity for only one day at least have an idea of what isn't for them.

I have just told you my reasoning! My 3 reasons have now told you why I support Mr. Generic_Name's decision of requiring at least one extracurricular¬†activity. Making friends, getting to know other people, sparking a new interest, and having people choose something that they just want to see if it's for them. At least one of these reasons can help students when choosing their activity and make them feel better. Mr. Generic_Name clearly made the best choice for our school.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

If you had the chance to attend your classes at home would you take that chance? Most teachers in Generic_School agree that student get more experience and a better learning from actually going to school than attending school from home. I believe students wouldn't benefit from attending classes from home because there is more distractions and students can cheat without getting caught.

First, when attending classes from your home, there is more distractions in your home than there is at your school. For example, while in school you may have a couple students in your class who might start talking, but they can be removed so that you and other students can have a quiet learning environment; however, at home your brother, sister, mom, dad, or grandparents can cause a distraction while you are doing your class online and they wont be removed from that room or house that you share with them. Also, when having a class at home, people can be distracted by other things in your house such as: TV, Video games, chores, or even by other guest that are in your house to visit. In result, attending classes at home isn't beneficial for students. Attending classes at home not only causes more distractions, but they cause more cheating also.

Secondly, although attending classes at home can result in more distractions, it also cases cheating. Studies have shown that 49% of students use Google or Wikipedia in order to get answers on worksheets, test, and quizzes that the student is having trouble with at that time. In another words, attending classes at home will produce more cheating for those students who struggle on their assignments. To conclude, students who attend classes at home are more liable to cheat on a difficult assignment that they're struggling with.

Finally, many of students and adults have disagreed and believe that attending classes at home is more beneficial than going to an actual school. Many of adults believe that if students attend classes at home, then it can help and get them ready for the real world, but it can also help them get ready for collage. Studies show that over 56% of students want to attend classes from home because of other reasons such as: being able to sleep in, use there phone without being told to get off of it by a teacher, and even being able to play the game and do there work. To conclude, students and there parents believe getting ready for the real world can start now if teachers can agree to let students attend class from there home.

Students benefit more from going to school than attending classes from home. In conclusion, students benefit from going to school than attending classes from home because, there less distractions and less cheating.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
DC7A5FB980EB,"7 out of 10 students in every school participate in at least one after school activity. After school activities consist of participating in sports, helping other students out, and cleaning the school. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students have other things to do at home, some parents won't allow their children to stay after school, and students will go home later than usual.

I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students have other things to do at home. Students have to do chores, homework, take care of their siblings, they wouldn't have time to do any of these things. They will have somehow make time or do it some other day. One example of this is one day the principal told me that I had to stay after school to do a sport. Next, I called my mother telling her that I had to stay after. I tried out for track and made the team, I had forgotten that my mother wanted me to cook the chicken because she wasn't going to be home. Later that day, I went home and my mother was furious! I felt so stupid for forgetting to go home and cook the chicken that she had prepared the day before. My mom yelled at me, but she ended up forgiving me but she didn't want me to stay after anymore even if the principal made me. Another example is one day I had to stay after school to clean the floors of the hallways because my principal said the custodians needed help. What's crazy is that same day was my sister's graduation! My own self even forgot to give my mother a call telling her that I was going to stay after. I eventually finished quite fast, actually. After, I walked home and my mother was waiting for me, she asked why I came home so late and if I don't care about my sister. I was literally confused, I had no idea why she was involving my sister into this. Finally, I realized why my mother involved my sister, it was because her graduation! I apologized, and I never stayed after again. Overall, this is why I believe that the principal should not make students participate in at least one after school activity.

My second reason why I disagree that all students must participate in after school activities is because some parents won't allow their children to stay after school. Parents are very protective over their children, it was hard enough for them to let us go on our first day of school in Kindergarten; now they have to be even more cautious. One example is one day I was in English, which is my last two periods in school. The principal went over the intercom saying that there was going to be tryouts for volleyball. I really wanted to try out, being in a sport is something I always wanted to do. Also, I wanted to get into better shape. After, I called my mother asking if I could stay after school to try out and she said no. My mother and I went back and forth arguing why she wouldn't let me. Her voice started to break and she said that she's scared and she doesn't want me to. So, I didn't try out, I missed all of the try outs for volleyball. Later, my mother got a call from the principal from my school asking why she didn't let me, he overheard our conversations when I was on the phone with her. My mother kept telling the principal that she's not going to let me stay after. Lastly, I never stayed after because I knew my mother was never going to let me. Another example is one day I stayed after school because they were going to play a horror movie in the auditorium and the principal wanted as much students that could stay. I was excited, I've never stayed after school before, it was going to be a day to remember. Soon enough, I feel my phone vibrate. My mother was spamming my phone with text messages! I ran out of the auditorium and called my mom, she was between furious and worried. She sounded like she wanted to cry but also wanting to yell at me and hit me. My mother picked me up from school and we drove around and she told me how if I wanted to stay after I had to let her know before hand. Overall, this is why I think that the principal should not make students stay after school because some parents won't let them.

My final reason on why I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because students will go home later than usual. When students stay after, it's usually for about two hours. In that case, that would mean if school ends at 2:50, then if you stayed after school you would go home around 4:50. An example is one day my friend named Generic_Name stayed after school for a yearbook program. Later on, the program took longer than she expected, she got home around five. Her father screamed at her for coming home so late. It was late for him because the sun was already going down. I felt so bad, she came to school the next day saying she couldn't stay after anymore for the yearbook program or anything dealing with staying after. Another example is I was staying after school for a track meet and I was the manager because the principal wanted me to be the manager. The meet ended at 7:30, I honestly didn't think the meet was going to end at 7:30. My sister came to pick me up and she said if my parents were home they were going to be so mad. I should've sent a text to¬†my sisters or my parents telling them I was going to go home late. Overall, this is why I believe that students shouldn't have to participate in after school activities.

Because of students having to do other things at home, parents not allowing them to stay after school, and students getting home later than usual, I believe it should not be a must to do an after school activity, even if the principal wanted to.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,5

4040F5864E2C,"Have you ever wondered about space and all of the mysterious things in space? It? a crazy topic with many mystery?. A big idea is that a face has been put on Mars from another life form. It? a rediculous thought with many people such as me shaking their heads at the crazy theroy. There is no way the another life form could put this face on Mars. It? just a cool natural landform that ironicly looks like a face.

Their are many different planets with many different natural landforms on them. Mars just happens to have one of the most interesting natrual landforms however. The face as people call it, is a huge rock formation that gives us an illusion of a face. Humans have claimed that Aliens have put this massive rock formation on there, but from a scientific side their is not a single piece of evidence suggesting that Aliens are real.

Yes, the face is quite mysterious, but their are plenty of queer landforms on every planet. The media is a place that has taken ¬®The Face¬® and it has made it out to seem like Aliens have made it to scare us. I can understand why one who has no sceintific background might believe this, but these landforms can occur any where on any planet over a peroid of time.

With the discovery of the face and people skeptic of the aliens scientist? launched a spacecraft into space to see if it could find anything. Nothing. No housing systems, no monuments, no building structures of any sorts, and most importantly no life of any sorts. Mars has harsh living conditions so to find any sort of life would be crazy enough, especially aliens!

The face is just another one of those amazing natural landforms that space has given us. It amazes me and others what things can happen in space. There are for sure no Aliens in space, however. All of the evidence proves to the fact that there is nothing on Mars or in space that could build something. Who knows maybe in a million of years space could amaze us even more with another landform similar to ¬®The Face¬®.

C02F3803D0D1,"First impressions are often the first thing that people notice about someone, and they can have a significant impact on how that person is perceived. However, first impressions are not always accurate, and they can be changed with time and effort. In this essay, I will explore how first impressions can be changed and provide examples to support my argument.

First impressions can be changed through actions and behavior. People often judge others based on their appearance, but what they do and how they act can also play a significant role in changing their first impression. For example, if someone is initially perceived as unfriendly, they can change their first impression by being more approachable and friendly. This can involve smiling more, initiating conversations, and being more open to meeting new people.

Another way to change a first impression is by demonstrating competence and skill. If someone is initially perceived as incompetent, they can change their first impression by showing that they are capable and skilled in their field. This can involve practicing their craft, seeking feedback, and continuously improving their abilities. For example, a student who is initially perceived as struggling in a particular subject can change their first impression by working hard and improving their grades.

First impressions can also be changed through communication. The way someone speaks and interacts with others can greatly impact how they are perceived. For example, if someone is initially perceived as arrogant, they can change their first impression by being more humble and willing to listen to others. This can involve acknowledging their mistakes, asking for feedback, and being open to constructive criticism.

In conclusion, first impressions are not always accurate, and they can be changed through actions, behavior, and communication. By being more approachable, friendly, competent, and willing to listen, people can change their first impression and improve how they are perceived by others. It is important to remember that first impressions are just that - the first impression - and that they can be changed with time and effort.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,3

Generic_Name was a student class, but due to constant suspensions and eventually an expulsion, he failed to pass the tenth grade. If Generic_Name was given the opportunity to take online classes while expelled, he would not have to retake tenth grade. Many students every year fail a grade because they are not offered to complete schooling online.

However, many argue against online schooling from home. The social aspect is a huge part of school and could be considered¬†more important than the education. Without school I would not have the sense of ugency I have attained. School has given me years of practice getting up, getting ready, and getting to school on time. School ultimately is a job, and is a great learning experience for anyone becoming a working adult.

Online schooling benefits many students who need to stay home. Medical complications make many students home bound¬†and without online schooling, they would fall behind. Students with behavior issues have no option to stay on schedule with the curriculum but online schooling. Although, most of the social skills going to school provides are not present in online schooling, it still benefits many students.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
E661EBA39ADC,"Is the goal of the education system to ensure students come out of school truly educated or students come out of school with a mediocre education? It is my sincere prayer that the education system strives to see us, the students, excel so that we may be college, career, and citizen ready, instead of checking boxes on a piece of paper. With that being said, I believe that offering distance learning, as a means for students to attend classes via video conferencing, is a fantastic idea; Distance learning lets students rest and take their time, allows for more freedom, offers one-to-one assistance/ learning, and puts students in a stage of responsibility.

To begin my argument, distance learning lets students rest and take their time while receiving their education. One of the biggest things talked about is how early in the day High School begins. Students often have to wake up at 4:30-5:00 in the morning to shower, get dressed, and then be ready to walk to their bus stop. Studies have shown that waking up that early does more harm than good. This is due to the fact that most student's brains do not fully function that early in the morning. With having distance based learning you do no have to worry about waking up that early. This form of education also allows for students whom are sick with an illness, the chance to stay home and receive their education while attempting to better their health. It also helps students to not be rushed by the 90 minute class time the traditional school provides, but gives them more time to ensure they fully understand the content. Truly, distance learning gives students the opportunity to let students rest and take their time while receiving their education.

Furthermore, distance learning grants students and their families much more freedom. Since the distance learning is based online you can practically complete your assignments and study your material from near and far. With that being given to you, you will be able to travel much more. It also gives students the time to visit ill family that live away from them and not have to worry about being marked absent. Another great opportunity that this style of learning offers is the chance to work and to also attend vocational/trade school. Due to the fact that, through distance learning, you do not have to stay in school from 7:00-2:00 and you have the choice as to when and where you want to finish your school work, you are able to work more hours. Not all students live in the best circumstances, but with being able to do your work at your freedom you can work more hours at your job and also have the opportunity to experience your dream career through vocational/trade school. Surely, distance learning grants students and their families much more freedom.

To further my argument, distance learning provides one-to-one assistance and learning. We all are aware that students learn at a different pace. While being a student of this alternative learning setting, you are able to sit and talk with a teacher one-to-one. More than often, students don't ask questions nor ask for help due to the fact that they want to make it seem as if they understand all of the material they are taught. Through this method of education, students no longer have to worry about what the other classmates think, simply because it will just be the student and the instructor. By educating this way, it puts less stress on the teacher and the student, which will hand-and-hand eliminate classmate distraction. Positively, distance learning provides one-to-one assistance and learning.

Lastly, distance learning puts students in a stage of responsibility. As I stated earlier, the goal of the education system should be to strive to see us, the students, excel so that we may be college, career, and citizen ready. I believe their is no better way of doing that than to be taught responsibility. Through this form of education, students will be shown how to be responsible, mainly due to the fact that there will not be a teacher over them every day reminding them of the due date. Students will have to remember the due date and manage their time accordingly. Distance learning also ensures that students are paying attention. In traditional school, teachers are required to put in a certain amount of grades so that the grade book can ""balance"". With the online style of learning students are tasked with completing the assignments in accordance with the unit at hand and will only have to do work pertaining to that. It cuts time for both the students and the teachers. Obviously, distance learning puts students in a a stage of responsibility.

In conclusion, distance learning offers tons of great opportunities and holds even more value. Distance learning lets students rest and take their time, allows for more freedom, offers one-to-one assistance/ learning, and puts students in a responsibility stage. I submit that this new method of education should but provided all throughout the United States and I believe that if it is, students will feel much better about their education and feel a lot¬†more confident about the material in which they are being taught.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,4
aa3d7e4a,"Dear Senator, I am writing to you to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There are many reasons for keeping the Electoral College but the reasons I am going to point out ot you are, certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. There are also some reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College. For example voters vote for a slate of electors not the president.

First of all two reasons for keeping the Electoral College would be a certainty of outcome. Even though a dispute over an Electoral College vote is possible it is more likely to occur over a popular vote. A reason for this is the winning candidate's share of Electoral College exceeds his share of popular vote. For example, in a article called In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral vote compared to the 51.3 percent rodney received. Because of the winnertakeall basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory.

Another reason would be you avoid run off elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem no one candidate receiving a majority of votes. For example, in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, it states Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the poplar votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College.

Two more reasons for keeping the Electoral College are swing states and big states. The winnertakeallmethod of awarding electoral votes induces the candidate to focus campaigning in tossup states. These voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaigning going on. They are also more likely to be more thoughtful voters. Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by the malapportion,ent of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

A reason for not keeping the electoral college is that voters vote for a slate of electors not the president. These electors can be anyone not holding public office. The problem with is that electors can vote for whom ever they want. Some go against the candidate they are supposed to vote for. So voters are chosing the president they want.

In conlcusion please take my reasons for keeping the Electoral College into consideration. Again those reasons are certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. Also the reason not to keep the Electoral College is voters don't vote for a president, but a slate of electors who do.",0,train_essays,,9
58453EDC66BA,"Many people don't take after school¬†activities and some do that is just the type of person and they desicion of that person or their parents. I don't take an after school¬†activity because I feel like it would stress me out, and when I get stressed out I get angry extremely fast. My parents don't make me do because they think it is for the best to let me choose that desicion but some parents do make them because they feel it's for the best. So I disagree with this statement because some students may have busy a¬†life, some may be having family issues happening at the certain moment, and others may not be interested in a certain activity.

One thing is some kids may have busy lives and they can't make the time for it. An example is if a kid has a after school¬†job and they have to work on certain days. It means they would either need to get special permission from the school or would they have to take kids away from their job. Another example is if the kid has a lot of homework and they have a certain amount of time. They would have to stay up all night in order to finish the homework because of an after school¬†activity.

Some of the students may be going through some family issues at that current moment. What about if a student's parents are going through a divorce. That student could have continuous panic attacks or having mood swings the would probably get in them trouble. Also what if one of the student's relatives are sick or got into an accident. The relative would probably want the student there a lot because it could be getting worse or they could be close to death, the student wouldn't have time to see them.

My last example is if the student is not interested in a certain extracurricular. They student may get signed up for a sport he doesn't like but is required to take. He probably wouldn't try his best because he doesn't find the sport interesting or just doesn't really care. Also if the student attempted to sign up for something but doesn't make it, so they sign him up something he doesn't like. If a student would attempted to sign up for track but doesn't make it he might get signed up for volleyball but he doesn't enjoy volleyball.

So in conclusion I don't think it is fair to force students and their peers to do after school activities and it should be students or his parents choice. If a kid doesn't want to take a extracurricular it is their right not to and if they do, they choose an extracurricular. I believe it is the students choice to choose, or the parents of that certain student and not the school. So I disagree with it because some students could have a busy life like having a job, they could have family issues like a divorce, and theirs may not be interested in a certain activity like football or baseball.   ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,4
6E248B1F33B0,"As I reflect on my friendships, I'm grateful to have so many people in my life that have shared their Wisdom and Experience with me. It is truly a luxury that many people do not have. Wisdom and Experience can be invaluable resources for making the right choices, particularly when it comes to making difficult decisions. Access to this information helps us better understand activities quickly, as well as consider multiple points of view that we may otherwise ignore. From the insight gleaned from others, we can gain an increased appreciation of certain activities by understanding the reasoning behind them and how we can best apply them.

Wisdom and Experience can also help us become stronger. Knowing the challenges that others have faced, and how they overcame them, provides us with strength and motivation to pursue our goals. We are better able to trust our instinct and bypass any doubt that would otherwise prevent us from reaching our highest potential. Furthermore, by understanding the choices that led to past successes, we can increase our level of confidence in the decisions that we make.

In conclusion, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of Wisdom and Experience in helping us make the right choices, understand activities more quickly, and become stronger. It serves as a reminder that no matter our current situation, there is much to be learned from the people around us and how their experiences can benefit our own. This knowledge should be duly valued, and I am fortunate to have such strong support of friends who are willing to share with me.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Reflect on a friend who has shared wisdom and experience with you.

6776B92E4513,"During summer break, many students are busy on vacation or are preoccupied with other activities. Because of this, students are not reinforcing what they have previously learned or preparing for the upcoming school year. Summer projects are an efficient way to get students familiar with and exposed to concepts they will learn in school and bolster their knowledge. However, the decision of making summer projects either teacher-designed or student-designed creates a debate of the effectiveness of both types of projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as teachers are more knowledgeable with the curriculum which will allow them to prepare an assignment that is more effective for the student, teacher-assigned projects will provide a guide for what the students will or should learn, and students will most likely feel more prepared for school with an assignment created by the teacher.

Since teachers know more about the subject they teach more than the students, having teachers create their own assignment for their students will be more effective. They know what the students need to learn based on the curriculum, so it is ideal for them to decide what they should study over the break. Students will get more out of the assignment if the teacher prepares an assignment that relates directly to what they will learn in class when school begins. It will also strengthen their knowledge and possibly reinforce what they had learned before.

Teacher-designed projects will be a guide for students during their summer break to study useful information for their classes. Teachers can design projects that is relevant to the curriculum of the class and plan out what is necessary and useful to know versus what is not. In addition, teachers usually expose basic ideas and important concepts that will help students to make connections to what they learned through the summer assignment. These teacher-designed also provides some insight for the student on what to expect in the courses that they take.

Having teachers make their own summer projects will expose the material that students need to know when they go back to school. It will help students to feel more comfortable coming to class and ready to begin learning. Through these projects, students have studied and have a better understanding of the curriculum of the class as the teacher directed the students on content they need to know. These projects also help students to gradually feel familiar with concepts they learn in the beginning of the school year rather than jumping straight ahead to learning something new.

Not only do teacher-designed projects enforce learning and help students to get more comfortable with the content of the class, but they also prepare students before the upcoming school year begins. It is ideal for teachers to design such projects as they know most about the curriculum of the class, and it allows them to prepare a useful tool for students to study to get familiar with concepts and important ideas of the class. These projects are a small exposure of what students are expected or need to know and will help them to be more successful when they begin learning in their classes.   ¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9
7ACD45D12DD3,"Extracurricular activities can be fun, but not particularly when students are being forced to participate. Making students participate in something more than school can be very stressful. A lot of students enjoy playing sports or being in a yearbook club, but when everyone is forced to participate in something it loses that fun element. Some reasons why making students participate in extracurricular activities are, they could be doing other sports, they could have homework to do, or they can't fit it in their busy schedule.

Students may be filling their time with playing sports, and not have enough time to get participate in another activity.

A lot of students play sports, for their school or a rec team, and having more to pile onto their schedule is stressful. Sports are hard enough as it is, and to add to that also still having to participate in an extra activity¬†can mess up your flow. Having to balance¬†not only one extra thing outside of school, but two, can be very stressful. Too much stress can cause you to possibly mess up on your team, and get kicked off that team.

Stressing doesn't help you, it does the exact opposite. Stressing about that after school¬†activity you have to participate in doesn't help you when you get home and have to do homework. Homework is already hard enough not being able to focus, but with this new activity you have to do, it'll be harder. Having harder homework due to stress can cause you to get bad grades, and could lead to you failing that class. Most likely when you get home from practice, or another activity, you're tired and don't feel like sitting down and doing homework. But not doing your homework, can cause you to fail that class, which possibly means you get kicked off the sports team, and having to do better in school.

Some children don't do any extra activities because their schedule is busy and they can't fit it in. Some students don't have any activity that interests them, and others just like to stay focused on schoolwork. The students who already do something extra, might not be able to do anything else. Nowadays kids want to have good grades, so they can go to their dream school. Already doing something and then having to do another activity on top of homework, won't help you get into your dream school.

In conclusion, I think that for the students sake, there shouldn't be a rule implying that you have to do any extracurricular activities, if they want the students grades to be high. Having to deal with the stress levels is going to cause the students overall grades to be low. Either having to already deal with sports, homework, or not having enough time in your day to do anything else, I think that the students should have a choice if they want to do anything else. I think letting the students have a choice would be wise because then if they mess up their grades it's not the schools fault.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,4
A9258A6DF8AC,"I disagree with the decision that the principle made with having that every single student has to take a extracurricular activity. Why i choose to disagree is that there nothing far about be force to do something that you do not want to do. ""Ian you know what the principle¬†did"".""yeah I know every single student in the school now has to take one extracurricular¬†activity in¬†the school year and it so unfair that we are force to do it too.""You know Generic_Name the reason that I disagree with the principle is that I lose my time in and out of school also I think that we should choose if we should choose to do a extracurricular activity now my final reason is that some of these extracurricular activity I can not make to plus we were force to do it to.""

My first main reason that I disagree with the principle is that I lose¬†time. my first reason is that if one of the extracurricular activity after school then I can not do home work until later in the after noon also it be harder for me to get things done at home because¬†I will have to do things at home like clean and other things so I would¬†just lose more time. Another reason is that if it in the school day then I lose time to learn and it will be harder for me to¬†to the work because it going to take more time to learn it because I will have to stay after school so I can under stand what I should have learned in school that day. My final reason is that the time you lose you cant get it back so the extracurricular activity makes it harder for people to get things done with other things in school plus after. If you are doing something after school already it going to be harder to mange your time and not waste it because you have the extracurricular activity to do and now you have to worry about other things at home and if your doing out of school sports or anythings else that could relate.

My second main reason that I disagree with the principle is that we should be able to choose if we want a extracurricular¬†activity or not have it. One reason is that not every single student will cooperate and want to do the extracurricular activity and will most likely miss behave in that particular activity because they dont want to be there or they do not enjoy the activity and they were force to go and do it to. Another reason is that only a certain amount of people would like to have the extracurricular activities and others won't also people would like to chooses what type of activity that they would enjoy to do and would have the most fun in and not be board or miss behave. My final reason is that we should pick when the extracurricular activities because it would help and see what the students would have in common also we should have the right to picking what time they should be and what days they would occur on and what the topic we can choose to pick and see which of them are appropit.

My last and final reason that disagree with the principle with the forcing of the extracurricular activity is that we dont have time to do it. One reason that I would not be able to make it is because¬†I have other things that occur after school like my soccer practice would have to choose to go to soccer or go to a extracurricular¬†activity that I was force to do and did not get a choice that if I did not want to do it. another reason that I would not be able to make it to my extracurricular activity is that if it in school I would rather go to class then the extracurricular activity because class is more important and more of a grade then the extracurricular activity and I do not want to fail a class over something that I was force to do then if I chosen it. My final reason that I would not be able to go is that I was force to do something that¬†I did not want to do so I would most likely skip it and go home or to class if it in school. Also if it had interest me maybe¬†I would not skip but, it does not interest me at all and if I had a say in it and I would be in a extracurricular activity that I would feel better and would enjoy more.

""Hey Ian what you told me was right it is unfair for every one of the students to do a extra curricular activity that they were force into and did not have a say and did pick if they wanted it or not Also the reason that you listed were pretty valid and not just some thing you say that would be a lie.""Generic_Name what I said was the truth it not pretty it is valid because why would you want too do something that you did not have a say in and not want to do too"".""You know Generic_Name the reason that I disagree with the principle is that I lose my time in and out of school also I think that we should choose if we should choose to do a extracurricular activity now my final reason is that some of these extracurricular activity I can not make to plus we were force to do it to.""",0,persuade_corpus,,8

You dont know what to do and you are just stuck on what to do. Asking multiple people for advice is the best thing you can do and it will help you out greatly. Ever been stuck on one thing to do and never can think of a solution? In that case you should just ask multiple people so that you can get the best idea possible.

One thing that asking people for advice can help you on is not being biased. Being biased means that you lean to one side more than the other which is good in some cases but not most of them. Being biased is a big problem that many people have but when you ask many different people for there opinion you learn different sides to things and learn things you never knew. It will even make you more social to people because you asked for there side of things instead of already having a side. It will be making a decision faster and easier.

Seeking multiple opinions can be helpful because you can hear from many different sides. Everyone has an opinion there is no one in the world that does not. So you will wan to be as thoughtful as you could possibly be. So that you can range your mind to many different ideas and mindsets you do not have to agree you just have to listen to it and add it to the list. It is ok if you put it on the list just to cut it out that is what a list is for. Doing this can open up your brain and give you a non biased¬†mindset and that is good in life. So this step gets you better in many things.

After you used these to steps you have to narrow down your choices. This is the most important step forget about anything you know in the past, present or future because this is when you find your best choice. after you have cleared your mind you start to think about everything that was said to you and you start to eliminate ideas. Now ones that dont make sense to you are gone you can finally narrow down the finial ones think about in in real life if you did that and chose one, These steps can really help out someone that is seeking advice because they can get to pick what they want instead of being biased about the topic.

Now that you see that asking people for advice is the best possible way to get the best choice.

Although this face was unexpected,that doesn't nessasarily define that the face has anything to do with aliens. There are majority of theories we can assume from this topic. Few scientist condoned that this mysterious face had something to do with a very unordinary prediction .Some scientist seemed surprised when they saw the photograph of the face on mars.

As a scientist, many mistakes are made during observations, but that's apart of human life. Mistakes are casual in everyday life and, all of us make them. In my opinion, I don't think this entertaining outbreak had anything to do with aliens. In fact, they're wasn't a specific sign, or clue that an alien was actually was involved. NASA got a great shot at the face, and the picture closely showed that their was nothing do be deeply concerned about.

The face was defineitly rare, but over the years the face continues to fade so it shouldn't be harmful. If it happened to really be an alien, we would know from the recordings, and pictures that were captured. This is a huge topic to discuss, and space can likely be considered as a horrifying setting due to rumors, and scientific observations. Astrounaunts never discovered any issues, or new assumptions by traveling to space.

The main point is aliens aren't realistic, you may see them in movies, books, or perhaps may hear about them. An alien was never discovered by NASA, and the face just appeared to be a natural cause.

As I sit in my 8th grade class, staring at the clock, I can't help but wonder if using cellphones in the classroom is a good idea. On one hand, they can be a valuable tool for learning, but on the other hand, they can be a major distraction. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of allowing students to use their cellphones in the classroom.

One of the main benefits of allowing students to use their cellphones in the classroom is that they can access a wealth of educational resources. With just a few taps on the screen, students can look up information on a topic, watch educational videos, or even take quizzes to test their knowledge. This can make learning more engaging and interactive, which can lead to better retention of information. Additionally, cellphones can be used to communicate with classmates and teachers, allowing for more efficient collaboration and communication.

However, there are also several drawbacks to allowing students to use their cellphones in the classroom. For one, they can be a major distraction. Students may spend more time scrolling through social media or playing games than paying attention to the lesson. This can lead to a lack of focus and poor academic performance. Additionally, cellphones can be a source of conflict in the classroom, as students may use them to bully or harass their peers.

Another drawback is that cellphones can hinder face-to-face interaction. When students are glued to their screens, they may miss out on important nonverbal cues and social interactions with their classmates. This can lead to a lack of social skills and emotional intelligence, which are crucial for success in both academics and life.

In my opinion, the benefits of allowing students to use their cellphones in the classroom outweigh the drawbacks. With proper guidelines and restrictions in place, cellphones can be a valuable tool for learning. However, it is important to strike a balance between technology and face-to-face interaction to ensure that students are getting the most out of their education.

In conclusion, the debate over whether or",1,llama2_chat,Task: Investigate the benefits and drawbacks of allowing students to use their cellphones in the classroom.,5
52D8A64B2125,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identfy the many emotions of humans. This was designed to improve the accuracy in perceiving emotions of people around you. This system gives better opportunities for humans and computers to communicate. By moving the muscles in your face, it creates a facial expression, which is then compared to a face that is showing no emotion. This system would be valuable in a classroom because it help teachers relate to students and how they can improve their teaching to make things more fun and understandable, as well as recognizing personal situations.

The Facial Action Coding System helps teachers relate to their students by knowing how they feel about a lesson and how the teacher explains it. The texts states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student it becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor.'"" Knowing how a student feels can help a teacher immensely. This can show what activities and tactics help students most and some things that do not help at all. This could result in the improvement of grades and understanding of what is being taught.

The Facial Action Coding System can also help with the personal life that may be brought into a classroom. If someone is being bullied or is having problems at home, this may be a way for it to be recognized if the person is afraid to say anything. According to the text, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang."" This gives teachers and adults ability to recognize and resolve issues that may not have been known about before.

Many students everywhere tend to hide their emotions and thoughts because they are afraid of consequences, whether it is mentally, physically, or emotionally. The Facial Action Coding System can help in ways people can't just by asking someone how they feel. This program can be used to help people in need whether it is relating to learning skills or regarding personal problems taking place at home or school. This gives opportunites to help in many situations and would be very effective in schools.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
68201A571AE4,"During the summer leading up to my eighth grade year, my mom suggested that I get involved in an extracurricular activity because they are very beneficial for kids.

I thought for a while, then took her advice and decided to play on my high school's junior varsity football team.

When the practices first started that July, things were running pretty smoothly;however, once the school year started a couple of weeks later, things got a quite a lot tougher.

I had to learn to be responsible in order to keep up with my homework every day after practice.

As the season went on, I learned a lot of stuff about football and school, but most importantly, I had lots of fun doing it.

I am so glad that I took my mom's advice about extracurricular activities being beneficial to kids because I found that to be true for me as well.

Consequently, I agree with the decision that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

First, I think all students should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches students new, real world skills.

There are countless numbers of valuable techniques in the world today that are never taught within a classroom, but are needed for a successful career.

For example, when I played football, I learned the importance of working together¬†on a team with other people.

When we all learned to work as one team, we started to play really good and win games.

On the other hand, if someone goes all throughout school and never learns the skill of teamwork, it is likely that they will not be very successful when they enter the real world because teamwork is an important skill that is needed in almost every job.

Just imagine if you are a business owner or employer and are looking for a person that you can hire to work for you.

Would you choose the person who was never involved in any type of after school or extracurricular activity, or would you choose the person who was very productive and was involved in many different activities throughout their schooling?

You would probably choose the one who was very involved in their school because that shows you that they have the skills needed to work for you and can keep up with a job.

Secondly, everyone should be involved in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them how to be responsible with their work.

Most kids today don't want to do their homework, and instead only do the fun stuff like play on their phones or lay on the couch like a sleeping bear, which usually results in bad grades.

However, being involved in an activity teaches students that if they want to have fun and stay in their club, they must do their work before anything else.

For example, during football season, I had to be extremely responsible with my schoolwork and grades, or else my coach could have kicked me off of the team.

Similarly, being responsible can also be a key characteristic of getting into college or the workforce.

Just like how you have a low chance of getting hired if you don't have the skills, you have an even lower chance of getting a job if you can't be responsible and maintain your job very well.

Some of the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the most talented or have the most skills, but they are able to keep up with all their work and maintain their position.

Lastly, extracurricular activities teach students how to have fun while doing something productive.

As mentioned earlier, students these days only like to do the fun stuff, not the work.

Extracurricular activities give kids the chance to have loads of fun, but also learn valuable lessons.

As a result of the activities being fun, students will also be more likely to stay in their club because they enjoy it, which helps both the students and the teachers get along better.

Additionally, most students will go away from a class and only remember the fun things that they did in it, while they will forget¬†about all the important stuff.

But in extracurricular classes, the fun parts of the class will usually directly relate to profitable skills or morals, so that when students remember the fun stuff, they will also remember the skills that they learned as well.

For example, one day during football practice, our coach had us do a fun drill where we got to run behind our blockers.

I vividly remember this because it was really exciting when I got to do it, although, when I think about it, I also remember that in order to do it, I had to get low and run with the proper technique.

It was because of fun things like that drill that I was able to stick with the game and improve my skills.

So as you can see, I agree with the decision that all kids should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.

Just like how I had to alter my work schedule when I played football, extracurricular activities might not be that easy, but I can promise you that in the long run, they are worth participating in.

So even if you don't think extracurricular activities are good for you, go ahead and just give one a try.

There are all sorts of activities out there that are available to everyone, so all you need to do is find the one that strikes your fancy.

I guarantee that you will not regret it at all!",0,persuade_corpus,,8
C520733738FF,"in this essay i am going to be writting about how a new technology called the facial action coding system enable computers to identify human emotions. an i am going to be writting that this could be valuable. i am going to be writting about why this is valuble.

first,in this paragraph i am going to be writting about how ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal.""in the article it says that some individuals often show diffrent types of expression,for example they used the one not smiling as broadly. what this is showing that this new thing that can identify the emotions could be usefull because it can let ther people know what is wrong with you and why you are not happy or why you are sad. in the article it also said that it can identify mixed emotions as they used da vinci's masterpiece.

second,in this paragraph i am writting about how this could help you with your friends and other people around you. in the article it says that we could already tell how one of our friends is feeling and how they look because we already know them. but it also says that we could probobly have some trouble describing them facial traits. and that is what this new technology does it tells you and shows you th facial traits that convey happy and worried.

third,in this paragraph i am going to be writting about how this could be useful in class and how this could help others. the example they used was a computer and some ads. the ads could tell your smile and if you are happy then another ad will pop up that is similar,but also if you frown the ads will be diffrent. they used a computer in a classrom because in the article it says that this computer could recognize if the student is becoming cnfused or bored. aalso in the article it says that this means that it could modify the lesson to the way you might understand it. this is why i think this is valuable in some cases.

in conclusion,i wrote about how this could be valuable. i said that this could be valuable because this could be used to show the diffrent emotions and how people are feeling. i also wrote about how this could be used in the classrom because it could tell wether they are confused with the lesson and if they are then the computer will modify the lesson to a way that you could understand it. this is what i wrote about in this essay and i am sying that yes this could be valuable in the classrooms.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
F61646B5CC08,"Dear, Principal what's your face

Having phones legal in school would be a good thing towards students focus and activity during class. So, I chose policy 1. I think it will be good for the students to have a way to express them selves more in the hallways or at lunch. This then makes the kids pay more attention in classes. All of the kids in this school are being socially deprived by teachers always yelling at them about having their phone in their pocket. It's like we don't even get any rights anymore! But having phones to use in school the students can communicate between friends from across the lunchroom if one of their friends didn't get put at their table. You might be saying, ""Why can't they just get up and walk over to their table and talk?"" But that's the thing, we can't! Our lunchroom rules say that we have to stay in our seats or ask a teacher to go somewhere unless our zone is called. But allowing kids to use cell phones in school will make communicating easier, help them know what time it is and if they are running late to a class they can text or call a friend to tell the teacher they are going to be late. Even though their could be the hazard of kids stealing other peoples phones. But it was their fault for letting them know about where you keep your phone in your locker. To end on a good note phones can help our learning and social life during class or in the hallway.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
C2BF4C553358,"The principal shouldn't change the school policy in the middle of they school year because if some of the players on the team might have C averages it wouldn't be fair to them to just quit the team because they have a C average, they might have too much work to do after sports and are tired and rush through the work just to get it done. Many students would be angry because they would think they would have to quit right away because they have a C average and have no time to get the work done, after a while they should be able to get the work done for school so they can play sports. The other problem with changing that policy is that a C is better than a D and it shows that they try to keep up good grades but a B would be better people who play sports and have a B average that's good and people who have a C average should at least try to bring their grade up to a B average. The principal should talk with the students before anything and try to get them to get there grades up before changing that policy also the principal should wait for the next school year to make any changes because its not right for the students who love sports and for the school because it could be the year they go to a championship game and bring back a trophy for the schools trophy case. Many students have a C average it's not right to make that change because they mighty have trouble at home doing homework or reading, is their a reason why the principal wants to make a change in the school policy if their is no reason she wants to change the school policy then she shouldn't change it.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
AB403848DA21,"Every summer, students nationwide are bombarded with projects that are supposed to help them retain information or get a head start on the upcoming year. These projects can range from a series of math problems to studying entire chapters of text for a quiz on the first day of school. Teachers intend to help their students retain knowledge from previous years, but most students consider the projects busy work. Students want to use the summer to recharge themselves and forget about required projects. Students want to do well in school, but most of them have their eyes on the future, rather than reviewing work from the past. Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed because students know what information they struggle with the most, and students are more motivated to work on projects that they select.

First off, students know what information they struggle with the most, so they can create projects that are relevant to those topics. For example, during this past summer, I recalled that my weakest point in Algebra 2 was graphing rational functions, so I decided to make a picture out of rational functions. I made a picture of a snowman and used the holes, the most confusing part of rational functions, as eyes for the snowman. While my artwork was nothing special, the purpose of the project helped me master a tough part of Algebra 2, while preparing me for calculus. Similarly, my parents, who took psychology courses at Generic_School, said that their professor recommended that they review any quiz or test that they felt was the most difficult over spring break to prepare for the final. After reviewing every term that initially confused them, every student in the class increased their grade on the final by at least five percent. The professor did not require them to do anything, but the students knew what they needed to review and succeeded in the end. Students learn best when they are set free to review material using their own strategies, instead of getting a cookie cutter approach from a teacher.

Secondly, students are more motivated to learn when they have no guidelines and can be more innovative, which makes student-designed summer projects the best option. For instance, I only took Digital Art in my Sophomore year because everyone is required to take an art class in high school, but as the year went on I realized that I enjoyed the freedom of the class. After learning basic tools, I made creative posters, characters, and videos, which eventually led to my teacher selecting me as an award winner. Every day, I looked forward to Digital Art because it was the least structured class where everyone could express themselves through their work. From a historic perspective, Albert Einstein was never described by his teachers as a good student. He would never pay attention in class because his mind was always set on bigger, more innovative things. He is widely regarded as the smartest person to ever live which highlights his intuition that was being halted by structured learning. If we were all confined to complete teacher-designed projects everyday, we would not have any of the technological inventions that have drastically changed the world.

Some teachers may say that they are best fit to make summer projects because they know the material that will be taught in the upcoming year. When teachers assign projects, they always have their eyes set on the end goal of having ample time to review at the end of the year for big exams. To accomplish this, teachers always stay inside the curriculum of the course during their summer projects to give their students extra time to learn less material. While it is understandable that students need a head start on the curriculum for the year, that reasoning is flawed because students are already restricted in their education for nine months out of the year, and they do not need to be restricted for another three months. The summer is a perfect time for students to get internships at places that will improve their knowledge and strengthen their passions. Often times, the work that students find at internships is not similar to the the structured work they complete in school. We should allow students to make projects about what they have learned outside of school, so they can educate other students who have similar interests. Teachers already have enough control over how students learn, and it is important that we do not give them even more.

Overall, student-designed summer projects would give more variety to the school and improve the versatility of students. Students are able to find passions through their own work and can inspire others to do the same. Teacher-designed summer projects have restricted students and prevented them from reaching their maximum potential. Students are more powerful than people give them credit for, and they deserve a chance to showcase what they can do through their own ideas. If we allow students to make their own summer projects, we will immediately see an impact on communities through volunteer projects and environmental projects. We need to encourage our principals to just try it out. Give our students a chance to make a difference in the world, and they will never regret giving the students a chance.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
BF4BD008BA9E,"Schools make summer projects for students to continue their learning, but they can't decide whether¬†they want it to be student-designed or teacher-designed. Student-designed projects would be more beneficial because students would be able to research their interest. Students would be able to use this summer project as a opportunity to find their passions and do some research about them. People might prefer a teacher-designed project, but I believe that student-designed projects would be much more efficient and helpful to students.

A student-designed project is a great idea because it would benefit the students more than teacher-designed one. This project would have students choose their own topic and do some research on said topic. Students would be given the opportunity to explore their interest, unlike with most projects. Students could use a internship or a presentation about their research to show their progress. Students who do an internship would have to present about their experience and prove that they actually did it. At the end of summer, students would present to one of their classes how they documented their experiences and what they learned from this project.

One of the biggest reasons why I think that a student-designed project would be a great idea is that it lets students find their interest. Teens in high school try to find what they are good by participating in extracurricular¬†activities after school. A student-designed project would be the perfect opportunity to find interests. Students would be given some time before school ends to think about the topic they want to research. Summer would be used to research their topic and document their experience. This project could help students get an idea of what they want to study in college thanks to this Student-designed project, which allows students to find their interest/passions and research them. This kind of project has the possibility to help a lot of students find their passion or at least figure out their options.

People wouldn't like the idea of a student-designed project because students can't consult or get help from a teacher if they run into a problem. I believe that this wouldn't be the case because the whole reason behind a student-designed project is that every project will be different and unique to that student. Students wouldn't need help because the project would be about them, unlike a teacher-designed one.

the beauty¬†of a student-designed project would be the originality of each one of the projects that is the reason why students don't need help on this kind of project, other than directions for it. A teacher-designed project doesn't really help a student at all because its just another project they have to do to keep their grades up.

In conclusion, a summer project would be best if it was a student-designed one. A student-designed project allows student to find their interests/passions and allows them to explore different interests. People might prefer a teacher-designed project, but I believe that student-designed projects would be much more efficient and helpful to students. A student-designed project is unique to every student and I believe it can impact a student career's choice.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
E96C123FAC95,"Character is often said to define who we are as individuals, but should we choose these traits for ourselves or be shaped and molded by outside forces? There is much debate surrounding this issue, and it is important to consider both sides before making a decision.

On the one hand, there are those who believe that character traits should be chosen independently. Self-determination allows us to make our own decisions, and makes us agents of change in our own lives. Moreover, it also allows us to establish our values and follow our own moral compass. By taking this approach, we can be assured that our character is shaped by the person we decide to be. An example of this can be seen in the way people choose to use their resources in different ways to achieve certain goals.

On the other hand, it is argued that character traits should be shaped, in part, by outside influences. External experiences, both good and bad, can shape and influence our character. Culture, family, and other external influences can all contribute to our values and way of life. Proponents of this approach argue that these experiences are necessary in order to help shape and refine our character. An example of this is how people from different cultures have varying perspectives on certain issues.

Ultimately, it is up to us to decide how our character is shaped and molded. We have the freedom of choice and the power to change the course of our lives. We can support positive external influences while maintaining our own autonomy and individuality. As long as we make conscious decisions about our character traits, we can shape our lives in a way that is best for us.

In conclusion, when it comes to our character traits, we have the power to determine our own destiny. We can draw from the values of those that have influenced us, or we can create our own unique character and determine our own fate. It is up to us to decide which approach is best for our lives, and we have the freedom to choose our own character traits.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Write an essay that examines whether we should choose our own character traits or have them shaped by influences beyond our control.

It is always in your best interest to seek multiple opinions to better your final decision. You should always ask more than one person for advice because you want the best possible answer and you don't want to make an irrational decision.

For an example, you go to your ""crazy"" friend Generic_Name for advice on how to deal with something at your job. Generic_Name's advice to you is to just quit. You then go to your mom and ask for advice, her advice is to talk to your manager about it and if that doesn't work go above your manager. If you didn't go to your mom after Generic_Name you would have been without a job, but with your moms advice you have the chance to still keep your job and work the situation out. As a result, you got the best advice possible. We may not always want to go to your parent for advice, but those are the more seasoned people that can have the best advice for you.

Next, we can all be in the heat of the moment state where you just want to punch someone or something and/or cause a scene, but if you ask for advice from a person that wasn't in the situation you will get a more calm response. You will have the opportunity to hear a better decision so nothing gets out of hand.

In conclusion, asking more than one person for advice works out better because you get the best possible response and you don't make an irrational decision you might have before hand. You will be able to get a better outlook on the situation and understanding as to why you should handle it in a better way.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
3B50C316E9CA,"Some schools have programs where you can take classes from the luxury of your own home. It would either be online or in a video conference. Having a way to learn without being there is conveint¬†for most people. Some students have a hard time making it or coming to school because,they may have a disability, having problems with their peers, or they can be drained physically and mentally.

First,disabilities are already hard enough to deal with but, having to wake up early to get ready and try to catch the bus on time is a struggle. A girl that went to my school was in a wheelchair, she had to take the bus in the morning and get picked up in the afternoon. One day she said, it was hard for her to get up every morning because she could¬†not¬†move from the waist down. Her parents had to get off from work because they had to pick her up from school each day. Most students have learning disabilities like ""ASD"" and need special attention.

Second,problems with your peers or teachers is one of the biggest issues when students don't show up or come in late. Some people may argue that coming across conflict with people helps students get ready for the real world. Even though that maybe right most students don't care. Most students if they are having complications they won't show up because it will continue. Students end up with depression or anxiety.

Lastly,students have jobs and other things to do in their time. They don't have time to keep up with the class. Balancing schoolwork,homework,a job,and family and friends can be a lot for one person. people that are in the military can be and class and work at the same time so they need to take an online class which would be more convient for them. Highschoolers that have a job find it hard to balance their time but, taking a class online will make it easier for them

In conclusion, it would be beneficial to have online classes in general. Having a way to learn without being is school is really helpful for some students. Students with a disability can have extra help. Most colleges are online anyways so, this can help you prepare for college.

F54BD89B665A,"Advancements in how we are providing education continue to grow in the number of options for how one is receiving their education, Attending classes in school is a way that a majority of people receive their education, although some students are provided the opportunity and option to receive education outside of the typical school environment, this being options to learn from home. These options can include online courses, or a video conference. Students would not benefit from an education outside of the school environment as much as they would attending school, because being separated from a learning environment makes it more difficult to complete work and focus, participating in an online course allows for a lack of communication and ideas from other peers, receiving help from a teacher or an instructor would be more limited and restricted if one were to take an online course.

When working in an environment other than school, in this case at home, there is a removed focus of the student due to the setting they are in, and it may make learning more difficult in terms of concentration. Take for example, completing an online course. When students are at home taking the online course, they are placed in a more comfortable environment that lacks a working ambiance. Consequently, there is a greater chance that the student could focus their attention away from the work because of distractions that may include: television, chores, video games, and others. They may also more easily have the tendency to slack off and fall behind. While completing work at a school, students are surrounded by materials that place them in the mindset of their education, and provided help and support that encourages learning and success, rather than the at home comforts. Fortunately, at school there are a limited number of things that will focus ones attention away from what is needed to be completed, and done to the fullest potential with effort. In a working environment the encouragement to learn not only comes from the instructors, but also the other students that also attend the school.

Provided a student takes a course outside of a school, they are not always given the opportunity to have other peers around that are earning the same education. Some may claim that independent work is a better option, but what is so beneficial from attending a school is that students are exposed to other ideas developed by other students, and can participate in engaging discussions to make further achievements. Through these shared concepts, students can learn and comprehend more information off of one another, and make connections through certain ideas that are shared in class. This is demonstrated not only through group assignments, but through the participation of students during a class lesson. When a student is called on to share aloud, they are sharing an idea that may benefit someone else's learning experience, and help with their improvement and understanding of the curriculum in the class. School group projects allow students to share their ideas towards one another and further their comprehension of the relevant information. The students may develop a new way to perceive the topic, which, beneficially, is crucial for their success in the course and in the future. Ideas are not only defined through other students, but are defined through the professionalism the teachers carry in the course.

Students knowledge is generated through in person help from instructors, given that students struggle to make a connection and perceive the topic. Online courses do not give the opportunity for students to ask engaging and purposeful questions to help them make achievements. If students who are participating in taking an online course at home begin to struggle in a course, the lack of communication from someone who is experienced may further complicate that situation; however teachers i school direct students primarily to succeed in the course, and are willing to provide all the help necessary for a student's success. Even if students are taking a course through, for example a video conference, they still are not gaining the same¬†help. If a video conference lesson was for a math course, it would be complicated for a teacher to view the mistakes made on practice that a student completed, and directly present to them what they did incorrectly. Teachers roles are to expand and elaborate on topics, so a student is able to gain a full understanding of the curriculum necessary for a test, or a future assessment. Those who are taking a course at home do not gain¬†that full elaboration or background knowledge as a student who is receiving in person instruction would.

It is crucial for a person who wants a full and purposeful learning experience to attend an actual school. Although some may make claim that taking a course at home provides for more personal time to complete other necessary tasks, and can learn the same information as those who are attending an actual school, those that are not educated in a school aren't receiving the same fulfillment and educational opportunities as those who are educated in a school environment. Some may also believe that at home courses aren't as complex and are more flexible, but they allow for more mistakes, and less knowledge gained through them. Schools are not only beneficial but are crucial success not only in the courses they are taking, but in future roles, whether that be, for example, in a career, or becoming financially stable. Secondary options to attending a school, like courses at home, are not the same and do not hold the same roles or positions as a school do in the sense of a person's success.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9
FE9AB60822CA,"Having a computer that can tell what you are feeling can and can't be a good thing. Like you could be sad or depressed and not want anyone to know but they computer does. It can send information to people and you didn't want those people knowing how you are feeling. This can cause problems in a family because it may tell them something they didn't want to know.

First off some people would rather keep to themselves because sometimes showing their real self can hurt others. You can always fake being happy or fake being interested in something that you aren't, but the computer can figure out how you are really feeling and let people know that you aren't interested in the thing they are talking about or happy that someone is talking to you. It can ruin everything between people. The article states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show carying degrees of expression"" (Paragraph 4). This is saying that sometimes people don't put much effort into emotions like for instance smiling, sometimes people don't smile as broadly as they would like to.

This is my opinion on being able to have a computer analyze how you are feeling. I think it would be a bad idea and it would be better off to let people keep their feelings to themselves. Computers being able to tell your feelings is a bad idea and shouldn't come to life. We should keep it the same as it is now, where people can be themselves and not worry about people getting scared or hurt by their true selves. ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

EAD7F1F02A93,"Dear principal,

I do not think it would be a good idea for students to need a B average for sports.

If most students have a C average, then only A and B be students can play. It is reasonable to take away sports from students who have bad grades, but C students disserve to play too. I think it would be idea to lower the restrictions to a D grade average or lower. And that if a student makes up his or her F or D to a C average, then they should get to play. You may not agree but i assure students will work just as hard to get a C as they would for a B. Also students that want to go in activities will be restricted. I would be better for a lot of people if you had C students in activities too. So, please consider, I think it would be a good idea to take the sport and activities restriction down to only D and F averages.

6fc1858d,"Dear Senator name of Florida's senator, I am write this letter to you because I know that congress is thinking about getting rid of the Electoral College. The Electoral College has help us pick a great President and VicePresident multiple times, it might not be everyone's first choice President and VicePresident but most of the time the majority of citizens that care about their country agree with the choice of President and VicePresident. We aren't just electing by the Electoral College vote but also by the popular vote. There might be some problems within the Electoral College method but getting rid of it is not the solution, there will always be some type of issue in the way the President's and VicePresident's are elected, are we just gonna get rid of those methods too?

One reason that getting rid of the Electoral College process is the wrong decision is because our founding fathers established this process in the Constitution as a type of compromise between electing our President and VicePresident by a vote of congress and electing our President and VicePresident by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Why would you want to break that compromise?

Also, if you think about it, how is it fair on some of the smaller states if we just did the popular vote. If the majority of a larger state wants some one for President and a couple of small states want another President to be win then most likely the larger state gets thee President they wanted, if we got rid of the Electoral College process and just did the popular vote. The Electoral College process also help produce a clear winner of the elections.

I know that the Electoral College process has some issues like the voters not being able to know for sure who their slate of electors are going to vote for. In some very rare cases the electors do not vote for the candidate you want them to vote for. That can be very unappealing to most people that they don't have that insurance. Another issue is that sometimes in a close election, the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. Most people don't understand why the popular President lost and imminently assume that the Electoral College process is awful and we should get rid of it right away.

Over all, the Electoral College process has been around since our founding fathers were around and we have had some of the most qualified and caring Presidents that amazed us with how they changed our country for the greatergood and wellbeing of our country and it's people. The Electoral College process is something that should stay with us for a long time, so that we can see what the next few President's will do for us in the future.",0,train_essays,,7

7B802407D629,"Some people argue that it is solely up to an individual to choose their own character traits. They believe that we have the ability to choose traits such as kindness, rudeness, helpfulness, etc. However, I believe that our character is formed by influences beyond our control. 

For example, we often see people around us display certain qualities and behaviors. We may be exposed to these characters day after day, and with enough of this exposure, our own mindset and attitude can begin to shift and adapt. Additionally, there are certain lifestyle habits and environmental circumstances that can have a large influence on who we become. Education, familial relationships, economic status, etc. all play a role in our overall character. 

Similarly, genetics are also a huge factor in our overall character development. Our values, thought processes, and communication patterns can all be linked to our genetic makeup. This can be seen in the many cases of people who grew up in very different environments, and yet have similar behavioral traits and characteristics. 

In conclusion, while we may be able to choose certain character traits, it is important to remember that our character is much more complex than that. Many outside influences play a role in the development of our character. Embracing this understanding of character development can help us appreciate the complexities of our personality and the various factors that come together to shape who we are.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Write an essay discussing the idea that people choose their own character traits, providing examples of three character traits (kindness, rudeness, and helpfulness) and counterclaiming that our character is formed by influences beyond our control.",2
04D653441263,"Online education has always been a controversial subject with the risk of not understanding the material, and students getting answers from their peers most of the popluation seem to be against the possibility. However, I believe there are new ways to look at the subject. The pros for online education are very proactive to the needed change in the school system these things are flexibility, time management and, mental health.

As a current student at a in person educational school, I have first-hand experience on how time consuming school may 6 be. An online education means that you are being told what you need to have done here before a certain time and, how you are expected to do so. It throws away the possibility of time consuming dialogue that students may have with other students or the teachers getting off topic with a personal story. Doing these little things that happen frequently can turn an 8 hour system into 3 hours. In the mist of giving these students 5 more hours in the day that is 5 more hours for students to work, hang out with friends, do chores and etc. These little things let us teenagers be teenagers just a little while longer. Adding to things such as, the employment rate, students taking college classes during high school, and the amount of teens volunteering. It gives teen the ability to be more flexible with their lives which is what we should strive for.

Secondly, When giving a student their own time to finish their work and nothing but the guilt¬†of not getting a good grade being their motivation, there will always linger the question of ""Will they get it done?"". To that I asked, is school not meant to teach us the tools we need to survive the ""adult world""? As teenagers we are always told to learn the importance of time management before we get into our careers and even college. However, there are no courses for these types of things but, instead we are expected to learn them through first-hand experience and natural growth. This online school will teach students their obvious subjects such as Math, English and etc but they will subconsciously teach the importance of time management. Students will be expected to finish these lessons on their own because, if a teens prefers to do their work early in the morning in about 2-3 hours does it matter that they're possible hanging with their friends all night. These helps us teens understand the importance of time management without throwing it in their face they subconsciously come to that conclusion on their own.

Lastly, the importance of mental health in the education system is lacking and to be quite blunt is part of the problem. Most, adults may argue that this is a false narrative because of the of outlets that the education system may offer to students. However, my question is ""Do these outlets reach out and succeeded to out way the bullying and stress of a normal public school?""

because the answer is ""No."". As student at a public school the amount of work that is pilled on and the emotional stress of bullying enough to fall into depression. However, these problem turn into other problems for example, as a teenager your friends become and big part of your life in terms of what makes you happiest. What the current education system fails to realize¬†is that two days of seven are not enough to truly cherish your time. Online school eliminates the possibility of those students who are to busy because of school work and because of it have no social life.

To concluded, Online school is and will most likely always be a controversial topic for as long as those who have been to in person school are around. However, I believe it's a matter of noticing that the pros of this new way of thinking out way the cons. These truly serious issues are being over looked because our older generation are extremely set on the mind-set that all generations need to grown up as they did. Let's look to innvoatote new ways.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,5
38F668E609B3,"Venus is the hottest planet in our solar sytem. It could also be one of the most dangerous planets too. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author thinks its a good idea to strive furter into exploring Venus even with the dangers the planet contains.

One of the reasons the author beleives we should keep finding new things about Venus is because it was though to be similar to Earth. Venus and Earth are even called ""twins"" because they are thought to be so alike. Venus was thought to once be covered in oceans that could have possibly supported life at a point in time. Venus also contains similar things to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. The only way we could figure more things out about Venus would be if we cept sending thigs such as rovers to research it and possibly humans one day.

Another reason the author thinks we should find more information about Venus is because Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth in our solar system aside from Mars. Venus or Mars would be the next step in our space exploration. If we do send rovers or people to Venus one day, we would need things that could withstand the heat and other chaos that happens on the surface of Venus. The author states that NASA has came up with an idea that contained a blimp-like vehicle that would hover about 30 miles above the surface of Venus that would carry scientists and would allow them to study the surface. The temperatures inside the blimp would be about 170 dagrees Fahrenhet and air pressure that would be close to sea level on Earth. The conditions would be rough, but humans can withstand it.

Though Venus is dangerous, that doesnt mean it's not possible for humans or rovers to explore its surface one day. Humans are driven by curiosity that leads us into similar places. If we can make it to the Moon, we can most likely one day make it to Venus and back. If humans were to one day even land on Venus, it would be a giant achivement for the human race.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
AE29FBE3C88B,"The article titled ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" describes a new technology known as the Facial Action Coding System (or FACS). This system is able to recognize human emotions. This new technology was developed by proffessor Nicu Sebe, proffessor Thomas Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman. Together, they created this revolutionary software and hope to see it's advancement, not only in the field of science, but in every day life. One of these examples include the classroom, where the ability to read student's emotions would be valuable.

In order to detect human fellings, the system first, builds a digital 3-D model of the human face. This model includes the 44 major muscles used by human's to convey emotion. Each expression is compared to a neutral model so that the computer can detect differences and the movement of certain muscles. The article reads, ""Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit.'"" (paragraph 3) Then, these action units are matched with the action units of the six basic emotions programmed into the system: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. FACS is then able to detect a face's emotion. Paragraph 4 states, ""By weighting the different [action] units, the software can even identify mixed emotions..."" (paragraph 4) The intensive proccess by which FACS works, allows a computer to associate human emotion at an extremely deep level.

The FACS software has many implications in everyday life. Paragraph 6 of the article elaborates on a few of these uses saying, ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your [computer] screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different... The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery."" (paragraph 6) One of the more important uses of the program is at school. While students are at a computer, FACS could detect if the student was becoming bored or confused and could then change or modify the lesson to make it more engaging, therefore providing a positive learning experience for all students. The article says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication..."" (paragraph 6) While human's may have a harder time detecting these deeper degrees of expression, a computer would have no problem. Having a technology that can detect this would help improve the world, especially in the classroom setting.

The technology known as the Facial Action Coding System, described in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", is revolutiuonary.

By comparing the movement of muscels on the human face, the system is able to detect a specific emotion. This system in turn, would have a major impact on everyday life and have major value in a classroom. Hopefully, with the FACS software and other developing new technology, people's learning experiences will be greatly improved upon so that students are provided with an approach to learning that works best for them.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
62DCD859B7FB,"Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, ""In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty."" This is a reminder to stop and think before we do something, for in doing so we open a wealth of possibilities that spark creativity and innovation. When it comes to financial decision-making, this is critical: taking the time to research and analyze the different options available is important in order to make the best choice. 

For example, when deciding whether to take out a loan for a house or a car, careful thoughts must be given in order to determine which option is the best. Additionally, investing in stocks or mutual funds must likewise be carefully considered since there is always a risk of losing money if the wrong financial decisions are made.

This concept of thinking before doing is equally applicable to other aspects of daily life. Before making a purchase, people can explore different ways of getting the item they need, such as looking for discounts and coupons or buying used. In relationships, it helps to take a step back and thoughtfully consider our feelings and actions before responding to difficult situations.

66FF0907BF26,"Cell phones have become integral elements of modern life, so it is no surprise that their use in the classroom has been receiving much attention. Many schools and universities have varying policies surrounding the use of cell phones in learning environments, ranging from complete bans to learning scenarios that include cell phone use. Arguments for and against the use of cell phones in the classroom can be found on both sides of the discussion. 

Positively, cell phones can offer many benefits to the learning process, enabling students to access information quickly and easily. Additionally, text messaging, email, and other online communication tools can facilitate collaboration and communication between students and teachers. Smart phones are also able to capture photos and videos that students can use for research projects.

On the other hand, cell phone use in the classroom has shown to be distracting to both students and teachers. Cellphones can be used to cheat on tests, watch videos, or send messages if not monitored properly. Additionally, too much reliance on cell phones can lead to students not learning the material in-depth.

6B292C385744,"Summer break can be fun for students, but is it beneficial to their learning? Over summer break, students often lose information they gained last year, so in response, teachers have been assigning projects to students to keep them engaged with school. Though, it has been called into question the value of these projects, as they are assigned by teachers, so students push them off until the last moment. Summer projects assigned by teachers should be student-designed because it promotes learning about interests, allows for more creativity, and is less work for teachers.

First, The student-designed project often helps students broaden their interests. Over the summer, students might pick up a hobby or interest that will benefit their future. Having the project be student designed could allow for some interesting projects. If a students project is turned in with all sorts of interesting facts, students could be encouraged to pursue that interest in depth, and, overall get a better grade on their project. If a student had designed their project, their project could reflect their interests.

Next, students should design their project, as it allows for some creative ideas. These summer projects are designed to be fun, and allow for exploration, but if all the teacher asks for is a PowerPoint presentation, than it doesnt look very appealing. Now, if a student came in with a computer-designed¬†model of their project, or maybe a song, than they could think broader for next year, and allow for more creativity in the classroom. If these projects were student-designed, than it allows for creativity to be shown throughout their student life.

Lastly, if the project was student-designed, it allows for less work for teachers. If a teacher had to design a project for his or her students, then it could lead to summer stress, and teachers may not enjoy their summer break. So, if students designed their project, all teachers would have to do it assign the project, and grade it at the beginning of school. If students had more freedom with the projects, it would be less work for teachers at the start of the school year.

Teachers and experts often claim that if the project was designed by a teacher, than it would keep a student focused over the summer, and he or she would get their project done sooner. However, this is false because teacher designed projects are boring, and one student or more students will always wait until the last possible minute to get his or her project done. If the project were designed by a teacher, it would bring on more work for a teacher, as they have to assign, design and grade, and allow for more stress over the summer. If a student designed their project, it would be beneficial for all parties involved.

In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by students because it allows for engaged learning, promotes creativity in the classroom, and, overall, is less stress for teachers over his or her summer break. In our current¬†society, students are more distracted than ever, with cellphones and video games; so, having a student designed project can benefit a student more, as it will not distract as much as a teacher designed. Students should talk to their teachers and administration at their school, asking for student designed summer projects.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9

d664b503,"The electoral college has been a part of the united states for many years. The founding fathers were the ones who established it in the constitution. The electoral college seems to have worked for all these years , but my opinion on this is that we should change it to electing a president with popular vote. There are many pros and cons to both the electoral college and the popular vote but the positives of the popular vote outweigh the negatives more then the electoral does. If you are reading this senator of state I hope this letter will support your opinion on this or make you consider popular vote.

The united states is a democracy so the citizens living here should have the right to vote for the president of the united states. With the electoral college the citizens are'nt the ones voting for the president the electors are. In the electoral college the voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then vote for the president. In most cases the elector votes for the candidate that their party wants, in some cases the elector has chosen the opposing candidate to what his party wants according to the second source. Since the elector is allowed to do this that is one reason why the electoral college is unfair. Popular vote is when the people vote for the candidate they want this is truly what a democracy is when the people choose their representatives.

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system in all the states, because candidates don't spent time in the states they know they will lose in. They only focus on the states that they know they will win in or of a close chance to the other candidate, because of this there has been times when people would not see the candidates at all or they did'nt get to see a single campaign ad. If there was popular vote then this would not be the case and it would be eliminated, because candidates would have no choice but to put up advertisements all over the country.

Even though the popular vote is a good way to go I think that this system of electing president is still not perfect or will never be perfect. The electoral college allowed some of are greatest presidents to win beacuse if they got more electoral votes then popular vote it would'nt matter they will still win. The electoral college also avoids the problem of one candidate not recieving the majority of the votes cast. The electoral college has been in are country for so long and has worked for us well but I still believe that the popular vote can be and should be used in future elections.

750AFA674F45,"Online classes vs. in-person classes: which one is better?

As an 8th grader, I have experienced both online classes and in-person classes, and I have to say that there are some pretty big differences between the two. One of the biggest differences is the way students pay attention in class. When I'm taking an online class, I can easily get distracted by my phone or computer, and before I know it, I've been scrolling through social media for half an hour. It's way harder to stay focused in an online class than it is in a traditional classroom.

On the other hand, when I'm in a class with a teacher, I feel more engaged and motivated. I can ask questions and get help right away, and I can see the teacher's facial expressions and body language, which helps me understand what they're trying to convey. Plus, I can learn from my classmates and get a better sense of the material through their questions and discussions.

Another big difference is the effectiveness of communication. In an online class, it can be hard to communicate with the teacher or other students if I have a question or need help. I might have to wait for a response, or I might not get one at all. In a traditional classroom, I can ask a question right away and get an answer immediately. Plus, I can see the teacher's face and body language, which helps me understand what they're trying to say.

Access to resources is another thing to consider. In an online class, I might not have access to all the resources I need, like textbooks or other materials. But in a traditional classroom, I can easily access all the resources I need, like textbooks, notebooks, and pencils.

Finally, I think the overall ability to learn in each setting is different. In an online class, I might feel more isolated and disconnected from the material. But in a traditional classroom, I feel more connected to the material and my classmates, and I'm more likely to learn and retain the information.

I disagree with Generic_Name because students may not be in the right state of mind to do something extra, it's unfair for the kids that work hard,and a student's grades can drop dramatically.

Students may have a difficult¬†home life and may not want to open up about it. Staff can't know what goes on outside of school and they dont know everything that goes on in school either. A students grandparent could be dying in a hospital and he has to sit at school with no idea of whats happening until he gets home; this student's not gonna want to go to practice. There going to want to get out of school and spend as much time with his grandparent as he can before he no longer can. If a student is getting bullied there not gonna want to be on a team with a kid there scared of. As fun as extracurricular activities are there not made for everyone.

Its not fair to the kids that want to be in a sport or head of the student council because they work hard to make it on the council or on the team. While the students that don't want to be there are there because it's mandatory. If there's a kid on the basketball team that wants to win the game and go to the state championship is put on a team with a kid that has the attitude¬†of ""I am¬†going to go out there and I hope I dont get the ball because I don't want to shot a basket"". That is unfair for the student that is trying his hardest, but has to work with people that are just trying to slide by.

They may not get to go home seven o'clock at night and they still have to take a shower, eat dinner, and do there homework for school. I remember when I was in theater I would get home and be tried but I still had to do so much homework,Therefore I was staying up til like eleven o'clock¬†at night and having to wake up at seven o'clock in the morning.

Subject: Support for the Electoral College or Transition to Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my views regarding the Electoral College and whether it should be retained or changed to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. As an informed citizen and constituent, I have carefully considered the information from various sources, including the texts provided, and I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for several reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College system ensures certainty of outcome. In the current system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the chances of disputes over the election outcome, as demonstrated by the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and his opponent. Furthermore, with almost all states using a winner-take-all system, even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Another crucial advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes a president who has trans-regional appeal. No single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, forcing candidates to appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions. This system ensures that the president represents the interests of various regions and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected. It also engenders the sentiment that the president is everyone's president, fostering a sense of national unity.

Moreover, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, candidates focus their efforts on these states, which can translate into increased voter engagement and thoughtful decision-making. Swing states, therefore, play a crucial role in determining the election outcome, as voters in these states receive the most attention and information from the candidates.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the weight of political influence between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as prescribed in the Constitution, disadvantages large states in terms of their representation. However, the Electoral College partially rectifies this discrepancy by rewarding larger states with more attention from presidential candidates. This way, candidates are encouraged to address the concerns and issues facing both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College system provides an effective means of avoiding run-off elections. It ensures that a clear winner is always declared, preventing the need for additional elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This feature streamlines the presidential election process and reduces complexity and potential complications.

While advocates for a direct popular vote argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic, the information provided in the texts demonstrates that the system has practical benefits and aligns with key democratic principles. The Electoral College ensures certainty, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages meaningful voter participation, balances political influence, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, I strongly support maintaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. It serves as a vital mechanism for ensuring fair and representative elections. I kindly request that you consider these perspectives when determining your position on this matter. Thank you for your time and attention to this important issue.

Sincerely,

One Small Act of Kindness Can Change Everything

Have you ever noticed how one small act of kindness can have a huge impact on someone's life? Like, really huge. Like, it can change their whole day, their whole week, even their whole year. It's crazy, right? But it's true.

I know this because I've seen it happen before. Like, last week, my friend Sarah was feeling really down because she had just moved to a new town and didn't know anyone. So, I invited her to hang out with me and my friends after school. It was just a small thing, but it made her feel so much better. She was smiling and laughing and having fun, and it was amazing to see.

But it doesn't just have to be big things. Like, you can even just give someone a compliment or hold the door open for them. It's tiny, but it can make their day so much brighter. And it's not just them, it can also make you feel good too. Like, when you do something nice for someone else, it can make you feel happy and fulfilled.

And it's not just people, it can also be animals. Like, my dog, Max, he's always so happy when I give him treats or play with him. It's like, he knows I'm being nice to him, and he's so grateful. It's adorable.

So, the next time you're thinking about what to do, just remember, one small act of kindness can go a long way. It can change someone's day, their week, their life. And who knows, it might even change yours too.

In conclusion, being kind to others is super important, and it doesn't have to be a big deal. Just do something nice for someone else, and you'll see the impact it can have. It's like, it's a win-win situation. You help someone else, and you also feel good too. So, go ahead, be kind to someone today, and see what happens!",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay that explores how just one small act of kindness can have an impact on people's lives.,1
BAC14C5693CD,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author is describing a new technology, one that enables computers to identify human emotions. This could be valuable in the classroom for both a student and a teacher. Many teachers can find a hard time to deal with students because of things that could be going on at home. Teachers can find it hard to also help students if they don't know how they are feeling. Facial Action Coding system can help those teachers understand what a student is feeling.

For example, Sarah has a lot of family issues going on at home. She comes to school, doesn't feel like doing her work and her teacher want's to help her but doesn't know how to approach her. This technology can help the teacher get a better understanding on what Sarah is feeling and even ask her why she feels that certain emotion. This can build up a good relationship between a student and a teacher. A lot of students don't have good relationships with teachers because some teachers could say the wrong thing which leads to the student not wanting to say anything.

In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states that ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", this also could a help a teacher to know what type of assignments or projects that she/he could give to the class so the students wouldnt be bored or confused. This could also give insight to the teacher on what she/he feels like they should do better in there lectures or what their teaching to the class.

In my personal expierence, I knew a lot of teachers who didn't know how to approach me because they either didn't know what to say or how to say the right thing. If my teachers had this type of technology built into the school computers and could see through their computer how student's and myself were feeling. I would have a much better relationship with most of my teachers because they would have known what I'm feeling, whether i'm feeling sad or angry.

In my conclusion, the Facial Acting Coding System would be valuable of students in a classroom because it could both help students and a teacher to be able to build a strong, trusting relationship and also giving insight to one another. This could help thousands of teachers worldwide on how they could help there students and also have a understanding on what they could change or learn in their classroom from a students facial expression.

F304843E97FC,"Imagine being able to detect how other people are feeling. even when they are trying to hide their emotion. New software has been developedthat improves accuracyi in perceving the emotions of others. This new sofeware, the facial action coding system, has promising applications for a variety of industries.

I think this technology is cool but i also feel like its a waste of money and time and i feel like its not important. I also think that using this machine on students is wrong. They need to give the students their own privacy. This machine doesnt really serve a purpose other than reacing facial expressions and emothions, you canj do that without the use of the machine thats why i think its pointless. i feel as though this is more of a game or toy then a useful technology.

As you can see, i do not favor the technology and i dont its vailid or useful at all for many different reasons.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
05665390,"Dear Florida State Senator, Although many could argue that the Electoral College is a fair system of deciding the president, far too many people consider it nondemocratic and inefficient for it it continue being our way of electing our leader. A new system of election must be created to make up for the pitfalls that are inevitable in the Electoral College. A country that is supposed to be a democracy does not have the voting system that such a proud democracy deserves.

Defenders of the College may say that the possibility of a tie is very low or that the electors chosen are confirmed not to betray the wants of the voters, but just because the possibility is low does not mean you can simply allow the flaws in the voting system to exist. A small hole in a fabric can only grow bigger, and the same goes for our electoral college. If we can't repair or replace the fabric that is our Electoral College, soon there will be problems too big for us to deal with in our current state. The electoral voters may keep the public in mind for now, but there have already been cases where electoral voters put their own wants ahead of the public.

One thing that the Electoral College does not promote is the power in the hands of the people. Although people can vote for whatever candidate they want, the elector is the real deciding hand in the process of picking our president. If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely nondemocratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote.

Besides the power it takes away from the common man, some could say that the system itself is very inefficient compared to what it could be. Even though it has a very low possibility, the fact is that a tie is possible due to the electoral college having an even number of votes. It would then go to the House of Representatives, who might not even have the want of the people in mind. Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. It's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to Al Gore in 2000. An election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future.

The Electoral College may be functional, but is largely inefficient and is not in the best interest of the common people. The vote for a candidate is not even in the hands in the people, but rather a minority of chosen electors. In a country that prides itself on the power the people have, and the control they have on how their country is run, the people have surprisingly less influence than you would think. We as a people need to speak up against the overrated system that is the Electoral College, and develop a system that fits the needs of a true democracy like America should be.",0,train_essays,,9
A95582C42CB1,"Driverless cars? It seems to be a major advancement in technology, but whats the purpose? In all honesty, it is a very cool idea. This idea though, has a lot of thinking to go behind it. Is it neccasary? What about the safety issues? How is this going to help the environment, safety of others, driving issues, fuel usage, and many other things? In this essay, i have many things to discuss and question as to why the development of driverless cars don't seem like something neccesary to fund.

In my eyes, cars are some of the coolest things ever made. I consider myself to be a ""car guy"" if you will. I have had a passion for cars since i was a little boy and I have always liked the idea of going fast and making the car faster. Driverless cars, in my eyes, are like taking the racer out of an INDY Car. Who is going to replace that skilled racer? Sure, we have the technology for it but is it really neccesary? Excluding calculators for math answers and Google for searching up history, I would rather put myself behind the wheel of a car rather than a computer. I trust myself to drive an interstate more than i do a computer to do it for me. A computer doesnt have the same reflex skills as a human would. If another driver swerves in front of me while driving, am I going to have a better chance of dodging them quicker than the computer and cameras would? I believe you cant always depend on technology to save you. Sometimes you have to take it into your own hands. Personally, I belive that driving a car myself is more enjoyable than someone or something doing it for me. I have always wanted to experience the rush and adrenaline of driving a Top Fuel Dragster at the NHRA. If i had the opportunity, i would never let a computer do that for me. There are many people who think this way as well.

Another issue with this technology is the safety of it. As i stated in the last paragraph, who is going to dodge a swerving car faster; the computer, or myself? If im paying attention then i have a much better chance of doing it quicker than the computer. What if it malfunctions? No technology ever invented is fool proof or issue free. At some point in time, something breaks, needs replaced, or just gets too old. Its the same thing with original car parts as well. Everything gets old and needs replaced at some point in time. What am i to do if my driverless car malfunctions on the road? Safety is always a major concern.

I agree that there a many pros to go along with the Driverless Car. But with most pros, there is a con to go with it. A pro of the driverless car would be the stress relief. Technology is something that makes life easier. But the con is that you cant always depend on technology to work 24/7. Another pro would be simply how amazing it is that a car is actually driving itself. The con for this is the actual cost. How much will this technology cost to develop? The economy is always changing paces and it isnt always possible for everyone to own the lastest and greatest technology. Im also very sure that the maintenance and repair cost of something like this would be through the roof just like any other technological advancement.

In conclusion, I disagree with the production of the driverless car. I believe it takes away the joy of the ride, along with the safety of it as well. The human factor of the driving machine will always play a vital role in every day transportation. The human could be the deciding factor between safety and reliability.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
llama_70b_v115,"Dear State Senator,

I am writting to you today to express my opion on the electoral colledge. I believe that we should keep the electoral colledge the way it is. I know that some people think that it is unfair and that we should have a popular vote system. But I think that the electoral colledge is fair and here's why.

First of all, the electoral colledge makes sure that smaller states have a voice. If we had a popular vote system, then the bigger states with more people would have all the power. The smaller states would be ignored and their intrests would not be represented. But with the electoral colledge, each state has a certain number of electoral votes, no matter how big or small it is. This means that presidential canidates have to pay attention to all states, not just the big ones.

Second, the electoral colledge prevents a tyranny of the majority. This means that if one party or canidate has a majority of the votes, they can't just force their will on the minority. With the electoral colledge, the president has to win a majority of the electoral votes, which means that they have to have support from a broad range of people, not just one group.

Finally, the electoral colledge has been a part of our country's history for over 200 years. It was set up by the founding fathers and has been used in every presidential election since the begining. Changing it now would be a big mistake. It would be unfair to all the people who have used the electoral colledge in the past.

I know that some people say that the electoral colledge is undemocratic, but I don't think that's true. It's actually very democratic because it gives each state an equal say in the election. It's not just about the number of people, it's about the number of states. And each state has an equal number of electoral votes, no matter how big or small it is.

I hope that you will consider my opinion and keep the electoral colledge the way it is. Thank you for your time and consiteration.

A6A6C7852F05,"First impressions are a funny thing ‚Äì they often stick with us and have a huge impact on how we perceive someone. However, it is important to remember that first impressions can be wrong, and it is not possible to judge someone's character based on the few limited points of view we have of them early on. Everyone has the right for their character to be judged on its own merits and not by a few fleeting moments.

First impressions are based on a limited scope of facts and can often be heavily biased. We may think that a person is unkind based on a lack of politeness in an introduction, but it does not give us a full understanding of their true character. We may think someone intelligent based on their manner of speaking in an interview, but that does not tell us the full range of their knowledge. It is only by taking the time to get to know someone through meaningful conversations, spending quality time with them, and learning more about their background that we can gain a better understanding of who they are.

It is also important to remember that we all have the capacity to grow and change over time. Our beliefs and opinions can shift, and it is important to recognise this when judging someone. We must understand that nobody is perfect and that we all make mistakes. It is only through understanding and patience that can we learn more about an individual and their character. 

In conclusion, it is impossible to judge someone based on their first impressions. We must take the time to get to know someone properly and keep an open mind if we want to gain a full understanding of their character.

BCDED505B597,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student advocating for policy number 1 concerning phone usage in class:

Hey Principal [Name],

I think we should be able to use our phones in class more. I know some people might say it's distracting, but I think it could actually help us learn better. Here are some reasons why:

First, phones are like little computers that we carry around with us everywhere. So, if we can use them in class, we can look up things that we don't understand right away. Like, if we're learning about a new topic in science and we don't get it, we can look it up on our phones and learn more about it. That way, we can understand it better and do better in class.

Second, phones can help us stay organized. We can use our calendars and reminders to make sure we don't forget important assignments or tests. And we can use our notes app to take notes in class and study them later. That way, we can review what we learned and make sure we don't forget anything.

Third, phones can help us communicate with our teachers and classmates. If we have a question about something we're learning, we can ask our teacher or classmates on our phone. That way, we can get help right away and not fall behind. And if we're working on a group project, we can use our phones to communicate with our group members and share ideas.

I know some people might say that phones are distracting, but I think they can actually help us learn better. If we're allowed to use our phones in class, we can use them to learn new things and communicate with our teachers and classmates. So, I think policy number 1 is a good idea and I hope you'll consider it.

D2A0B9B93DC3,"Changing our ways on how we use cars for the better? Is it just so happen that people are using there car less than usual? In many places like Germany, Paris, Bogota are changing the ways to use cars. To reduce every little problem cars are causing. Traffic jams, smogs, and reducing greenhouse gas emmisions, people are getting smart about using there cars everyday. Maybe people are tired of using all cars of the time.

When people buy car, it gives them alot of freedom knowing they area able to go where ever they're heart desires. Lately people aren't feeling the whole waiting in traffic if theres an accident or just to much cars. Bus rides, trains, taxi are helping reduce this. People can go somewhere without waiting that long just for a little price. In Germany there are new laws where they put a prices to put cars and there is only certian places you can put there cars at. 70% of families in Germany have do not own cars and 57% sold there cars because of this new law? You¬† would think thats people would complain about having cars and having no place to put them. But many people are accuatly happy that they put this new type of law. Many people prefered to have this happen.

Smogs? what are smogs? smogs are grey clouds that hurt is in ways we dont even know. Cars emmit these deadly gases and we dont know it. Cars arent the only one who emmit they clouds of grey smoke, factories emmit this also. Which is not helping our ecosystem at all. In Paris they had an order to help redude this problem. On mondays motorists with even-numbered liscense plates were ordered to leave their cars at home which on the following day people with odd numbered liscenes plates were doing the same thing if they did not follow this ruling they were have to suffer a thirty one dollar fine. This helped alot with the smog.

Places like Germany and Paris arent the only one who are changing the ways. In Bogota they have a car free day which only allows you to take a bicycle, taxi, buses or whatever you want but do not take a car or suffer the rath of fine. Going on for three years now people are saying they enjoy these types of days because everything is more relaxing it reduces stress and air pressure which is a really good thing. Even when it rains it doesn't stop people from participating from this. There is even a 118 mile bicycle path that shows how much people want to change the way they use cars. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, snooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

Many sciencetists are believing that the car culture is coming to an end. Cars sales have drop alot. People are taking the bus, taxis, and even trains to avoid traffic. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Younges ages don't even drive till the age of 21 or they don't even care till then. They can usually care poll to places like partys, mall and the beach. They don't need a seperate car for each person when they are all going to the same place. Which is feel its a good and bad things. Its good because poeple are caring more that were causing harm to our own home and that they know that they can do all they want together and still have fun. It causes harm to busineses many stores could go out of business.

It does not matter if we try to stop using cars or not we are always hurting in some other way. Traffic jams, smogs and reducing greenhouse emmisions are just the begining of this all. We can do way more if we put out mind set to it.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

31d00389,"Dear Senator of Florida, I am a 15 year old concerned citizen and I would like to address a serious problem. Our country's process of electing our president, the Electoral College. I believe there are certain aspects of this process which are both good, and bad, but still need to be revised. To fix this unfair system of election, we just need to change a few details of it, in particular, the states' ""winnertakeall"" system.

Of course there are people who agree with this method of voting, but i am not one of them, and neither is Bradford Plumer. In bradford excerpt from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"", He explains to us the injustice of the electors that we vote for. Most of the time electors stay with their party's candidate, but sometimes they can be persuaded to switch sides. How would you like it if you and the majority of your state voted for a certain president through your states electors, and they went and stabbed you in the backfiguratively and voted for the other president. You have just been cheated out of your vote! That doesnt sound very democratic to me.

People do actually believe in this system of voting though, hard to believe, I know, but Richard A. poster's ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" gives us a pretty good reason of why they should. Richard explains to us the method of how a larger state with a large population, which would have a larger popular vote, has more weight than a smaller state with a smaller population and a smaller popular vote. He also tells us how there will always be an outcome, no matter what. Like how Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral vote and 51.3% of the popular vote. Cutting it a bit close there? Enough of that percentage of popular votes lost during the ""winnertakeall' method could change the election of the president.

So dont you see? ""Winnertakeall"" method just gained someone more votes than they deserved! Essentially robbing the other candidate of his votes! Once again Bradford Plumer hit the nail on the head with his description of the ""winnertakeall"" method. He understands the system and we are lucky enough he explains it to us in such easy terms. Instead of a candidate making his rounds to each of the states and raising his popularity, he ignores certain states that he knows he will get all of the votes for because he already owns a majority, 50%. It could be as little as 51% for him to gain all the votes of that state, and depending on the population of that state, lost more voters for the other candidate than an entire 's sum could give him. So candidates spend time in only a select few states trying to win the vote. Wouldn't this make you feel left out? Unimportant? Nothing but just a blip in the course of your country's history? I wouldnt want that feeling.

All ready a few states such as Maine and Nebraska have realized the stupidity of this system and have decided to change their voting method. This is why I write to you as our senator to help our state correct this process so we can fairly and justly choose our president, but what do I know, Im only 15.",0,train_essays,,3

Like, I know this is a lot of work, but I'm up for the challenge! 

Okay, so let's start with the radio.  The radio was invented in the early 1900s by a guy named Guglielmo Marconi. He was Italian, and he was like, super into radio waves and stuff. He worked really hard to develop the first practical wireless telegraph, which could transmit audio signals over long distances.  Can you imagine not being able to listen to music or news on the go? Like, it's crazy!

But Marconi didn't stop there. He kept working on improving the radio, and soon other people started inventing new things like the vacuum tube and the transistor. These inventions made radios smaller, cheaper, and way more powerful.  And now we have like, billions of radios all over the world! 

Next up is the computer.  Oh man, where do I even start?  So, the first computer was invented by a guy named Charles Babbage in the 1800s. He was like, a total genius, and he created the Analytical Engine, which could perform calculations way faster than any human.  But it wasn't until the mid-1900s that computers started to become more accessible to the general public.  Like, think about it, we can now do so much more than just calculate numbers! We can play games, watch videos, and even communicate with people on the other side of the world!

0873F94DA728,"Now, these days computer softwares are able to do so many things, such as sing (Vocaloid), organize our schedule, and even recognize our emotions.

This new software is called Facial Action Coding System and was created by Prof. Thomas Huang, from the University of Illinois, with colaboration of Prof. Hicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. These two profesors are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to comunicate.

The purpose of the Facial Action Coding System is to recognize the subtle facial movements that humans use to express their emotions. The process of creating this new technology began with a 3-D computer model of the human face; all 44 facial muscles were included. With the of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman. Eckman classified six basic emotions such as: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

Have you wondered if this technology would be useful for a classroom?

It would certantly be useful in some cases, for example, an investigation. Imagine there has been a case of bullying that ended up with suicide. Everyone who is connected to the victim, which is a student, had to be tested with the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) to whether tell if the student was telling the truth. In these kind of cases would be useful.

However, if this techology, the FACS, was used for only classroom purposes the would only be for Pscychology. This is a High School level class, it wouldn't be used for Elemtary or Middle School. Unless the staff of the schools introduces this technology to the kids. Unless there is a study for kids emotions at school when presented in various different situations.

In conclusion, there are many uses for this software but not exactly for classroom uses. The government, the police, investigators, and phisicans may use these to determine many things. Crimes would be sloved by studying the expressions of a suspect in a trial or interogation.",0,persuade_corpus,,9

A few days later NASA unveiled images for everyone to see while captioning it ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.. formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The landform was just formed by shadow, which means this just gives others the illusion that it's a face, but it is just a natural landform.

Many out there have created movies, books and magazine article on the Face but this is all just bandwagon, trying to just sell their products and make money out of false theories.

I am confused to the reason on why you would choose to change the school's policy on admission into sports. I do not believe there needs to be a sudden change in policy, and it seems unfair to the students who have been participating in sports and have also been getting a C grade point average. Therefore, I do not believe a change in school policy would be appropriate to the students of your school. I simply do not understand the point why you wouldn't choose otherwise.

Our school has been excelling in sports activities and competitions for the past few years. These athletic students you allow into your school have a chance at becoming something of themselves, and changing this unneeded policy on admission into sports would crush most of their dreams. Isn't the school of yours supposed to portray spirit and a will to play competitively against other schools? Not only do I believe it is inappropriate to change the school's policy, but I also believe that by doing your act, you will furthermore dwindle the students' knowledge in academics, along with their spirit. I do realize that your students are average compared to other schools. Instead of taking away most of their privileges to being apart of sport activities, why not instead promote their academics and still allow them to participate in sports. This is a just food your thoughts.

28C055B82976,"Dear our state Senator,

I am writing to you for not only myself but for the citizens of our state. I do not agree with The Electoral College and I think that our way of voting for president should be based off of popular vote. I know our state and our country has been using electoral college as our way of voting for a very long time throughout our nations history. But Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrrational. and i'll tell you whats wrong with the electoral college.

As you may know we do not directly vote for our president. we vote for our electors who will (hopefully) vote for the president we want. when the time comes for voting the state legislature are technically responsible for picking our electors. We the people are not always in control of who they vote for and the electors could always defy our will. We do not always control who they vote for. So is it really fair if we vote for an elector who doesnt even support us and our say in who we want to lead our country?

Another reason why i do not agree with the electoral college is for the smaller states. they do not have as much of a say in who runs our country like we do. luckily we are one of the biggest states along with california. but in smaller states they almost have no say at all. they dont even see campaigns because no one running for office pays attention to the smaller states. For instance, The campaign in 2000 seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all.

One of the biggest faults in the electoral college even though it is very unlikely but not impossible is a tie. As you already know if there was a tie the election would be thrown to the house of representatives,where state delegations vote on the president. because each state casts only one vote, the houses selections would hardly even show the will of the people. the people would barely have any say whatsoever. does that seem fair to you?

Those are the reasons why i and many other citizens do not agree with the elecotral college. its unfair to us , the people, and smaller states. America is known for being the country of freedom and choice, but if we the people barely have say in who runs our country, are we really elligble to be called that? thats why i think we should use popular vote as our way of electing our president.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Taking online classes is a good choice for them to still can learning and passing the class.

First, for some reason people don't have enough space in school to graduate¬†in time if they can take attend classes from home that will be awesome to them to take classes from home by way of online class. For example,she is from Vietnam and she is moving to United State and English is her second language she needs more time to learn English and graduate than other student. She is nineteen now and she was staying in high school for 4 years she has to graduate this year but she still missing one more class is English 12, so one of her teachers give her the idea to take English 12 online class in summer, and now she can graduate in time.

Second, students can study through video conferencing when can't go to school. That is very helpful and easy for student to study at home. Even they don't have in school everyday they still know what going on in class. For example, student getting sick or have to go to some where a couple days, missing some days of school that is not a bid deal now, they still learn at home or some where else.

lastly, people may be got accident, sickness and have to take a long time to take care of it, they can not go to school. Study through video and taking the online class will help them a lot about missing their knowledge problem and doing their work at class in online, for example when you go to university that is hard an expensive for every class, so people must have to study really hard to graduate, if for some reason students can not go to the school they can still learning, doing their homework¬†and passing their class.

5993D6213F79,"What if your principal decided that all of his students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Would you go through with it or disagree. You could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or even serve on the student council. I think its a bad idea because we already have enough things to do for our other classes. We have homework, projects, etc. It will prevent more and more stress on all of the students.

I disagree because if we already have things to do at home or if we have other sports that we chose to do, it will interact with them. We will have to do so much stuff we would have to give up one of are sports or whatever you do. It might also impacts how late we get home. Our parents also might not want us to get home late because then they will have to be up late and get us and might be late to work the next morning or worrying about us for what time we will be home.

3F47D1C0FA1C,"We've all had those mornings where you slept through your alarm and woke up to your mom or dad yelling, ""Wake up! School starts in 10 minutes!"", and you having to throw on the nearest outfit, skip brushing you hair and teeth, and even miss out on eating a good breakfast to make it there on time only to realize you left your homework at home. If this scenario occurs more often than not, I offer a simple solution: online school. Most schools offer online classes so you can enjoy the luxury of a stress free, organized environment of your own home, whilst receiving the same education as your peers.

Going back to our morning routine. Taking online classes would flip that scenario backwards. You would be able to wake up on your own devices, shower, eat a healthy breakfast and not have to worry about getting anywhere on time. You set your own schedule when taking online classes and the only deadlines you have are for your classwork and tests. There's no need to rush when you're already where you need to be.

Working at home can also be very stress relieving. You can set the temperature to whatever you'd like, get snacks when your hungry, take breaks when you need to, and wear (or not wear) anything you want. Attending a physical school takes all those things from you with rules that only benefit the teacher and staff, but when you're at home, you make the rules.

Organization is another aspect that is greatly benefited from taking online school. By not having to bring work back an forth from two different locations, it eliminates that dreadful possibility of losing the work you put so much effort into. With everything being on your computer, it makes organization easier than ever. All your work is kept in all their corresponding subject folders, making everything easy to find, work on, and turn in.

One thing you might be concerned about is the lack of social events such as athletics and other extracurricular¬†activities that would might be involved in at a school. Being part of a team and making that team your family over the years is something I know people value with sports and other group activities, and not having access to that would be upsetting. However, I can assure you that with minimal research and effort you can find a multitude of activities that fit your likes and needs in your community or even a high level club program run by a private organization.

Stress, organization, and time management are all very important things when we are attending school. Your youth and teenage years are always stressful and hectic; and going to a physical school just adds on to that. To be able to make your own schedule, wake up when you feel well rested, and have everything organized in a senseable, maintainable manner, are just some of the main benefits one would obtain from enrolling in an online education.   ¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9

In German Suburds 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move in the German Suburb. They would sell thier car(s), and live without a car, and live a less stressful life. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two. I'm sure Heidrun wasn't the only one who felt like that.

Having no car wouldd take more stress of your life then you think. You wouldn't have to pay a car payment every month. You wouldn't have to worry about hvaing to pay for gas to get around. Lastly you wouldn't have to worry about getting into a car accident every time you got behind the wheel of a car.

""All of our development since World war ll has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" said David Goldberg. Goldberg is right. We put most of our attention and development into cars, and focus more on them than we really should. We don't really realize what damage cars are causing us yet, and probably won't realize for a long time from now.

Aftrer days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with even numbered license plates were orded to leave thier cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. The same would apply to odd number plates the following day. They should not only be doing this in Paris but everywhere to reduce the air pollution. The fine should be higher also to those who don't follow the rules. Unless you havea real emergency to use your car the day you are not suppose to then don't use it.

Not using cars would be a huge problem solver to most of us. It will help with air pollution. It will help with finacial problems by not having to worry about car payments or money for gas. Lastly it will help wiith the stress in people's lives and lower it.       ¬†     ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

To begin with, texting and driving could be extremely dangerous when kids are in the car. First, while somebody is using their phone while driving, it could cause a big accident if they aren't paying attention to what's going on in front of them. There are more texting and driving accidents then drunk driving accidents. People mostly focus on their phone then focusing and staying behind the wheel not crashed into a tree.

Moreover, everyone knows getting stopped by the police isn't the best thing. The tickets cost a lot on money and sometimes is very hard to pay. Even some police may be harsh and might even take you in to court. Nobody wants to get stopped and pay for the price.

In addition, texting and driving is obviously not safe. Every year, at least 200,000 people experience accidents caused by texting while behind the wheel. The way the number keep increasing is honestly awful and so sad. I'm hoping that more in the future the number will decrease rather then increasing.

If there's something you want but it's expensive. Also, if someone gets in a fight. If there's someone you don't like or disagree with. Lastly, if someone lies. When someone did something wrong and lied about it. Seeking multiple opinions can help some make a better choice.

Furthermore, seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice by determining which advice is accurate. For example, to be sure that it's reliable. If many said the same thing while others said a different thing. Also,if someone wasn't sure about the advice. Ask people for more advice if the advice is inaccurate. Lastly, if the advice is inaccurate. If someone said one thing while others said the other thing. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

830CCF8E0B23,"The right to choose elective classes is of the utmost importance for students. This choice allows students to explore different interests, diversify their education, and pursue passions both in and outside of their normal academic endeavors. Forcing students to take every elective class can be a waste of time because it does not allow for students to follow natural inclinations that are unique to them. 

Not every student enjoys the same classes, and it is to the benefit of the student, teacher, and school system if students are able to explore what they are genuinely interested in. This will encourage diligent study and draw out a creative and thoughtful approach to new material. Having the freedom to pick and choose elective classes can also open the student up to unexpected interests they may not have known to have before. 

Requiring students to take a certain set of elective classes could also result in a time-consuming process without a significant educational benefit. Students can be made to complete classes they have little interest in, joining in lectures with minimal engagement or enthusiasm. If students had more choice, their motivation and improved engagement could lead to better learning. 

In conclusion, allowing students the choice of what elective classes to take is of the utmost importance.

6F9741277AB3,"People should make their own decisions instead of seeking guidance from experts or authorites about lifes important matters. I personally know that making your own decisions is better then other people making your decisions because if a expert or other person did, they could probably decide something you dont want and then regret it later in life.

One reason why i know making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts is becuase when making your own desisions you know what your doing but you have to think twice about it and then go with it. Like for example, if i chose to take geosystems instead of physics i think about it twice because i know what could be the bad thing and the good thing about that class and then go for what i think is better.

Second reason why i know making your own decisions is better because when a person makes a decision they made, then later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake. Thats a good thing because learning from your mistake's helps you a lot and benefits the wrong and making mistake's will make you a more successful person. For example, if i were to take an exam then get the results that i failed because i got a really bad grade i would try again but wouldnt give up which makes me successful.

Final reason why i know making your own decisions is better because who else in this world can? Its your life and theres never gonna be a person right by you telling you what do and what not to, so they have to learn by their selfs becuase no one is. For example, what if i said i wanted to go buy a house, who should i ask to make my decision? no one because you make your own decisions in this life.

These are the reasons why making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts.",0,original_moth,Task: Examine why it is better to make your own decisions in life rather than seeking guidance from experts or authorities.

01F899239821,"Cell phones are very dangerous in today's time. Did you know that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction that driving under the influence of alcohol? Did you know that it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car? Did you know that having your cell phone in your hand is illegal in today's time? I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.

To start off, there are several things that could happen if you choose to use your cell phone while driving. You could run off the road, you could hit someone else's car, or you could hit an actual person. You never know what could happen if you choose to pick up your phone. You should consider other motorists. You should consider protecting the pedestrians. You should consider your passengers. You should defiantly consider yourself.

Using your cell phone while driving is something that you shouldn't do. You never know what other lives you could affect just because you want to use your phone. Maybe you think, it will just be for a few seconds to text someone back but in those few seconds your life can change tremendously. It only takes a few seconds to park your car. Instead of taking your own life and someone else's in those few seconds, you can park your car and then use your phone. The vehicles can be replaced but the people inside those vehicles can't.

Finally, using your phone while driving is illegal. If you choose to use your phone, you are going to end up having to pay a ticket, living with the regret of hurting other people around you and living with pain because of the minute you needed on your phone. Whoever you think you must respond to or look at, would much rather you make it to your destination in one piece then responding to their text or call.

That person would want you to wait until you are parked than to take someone else's life and your own.

In conclusion, it all comes down to using your phone while driving or not. I hope you always remember that one text, call, or scroll is not worth it. Keep your eyes on the road and always give behind the wheel, all your effort. No one wants to get into a car wreck, sometimes it does happen but don't let the reason of it be, you are using your phone. I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
76BF3852B313,"Student-designed projects are great, they persuade students to be more unique and creative on their project. There is an ongoing debate over whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. There are those who argue that teacher-designed projects are better, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, projects should be student-designed.

There are a variety of reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. Students are more creative than teachers. For example, I like to add more color and pictures to my project. When students work on project by their selves they tend to understand it better because there is no pressure on them. Furthermore, no one is telling the students what to read or¬†write on their project. When a student designs there own project it looks easier to them, and it also builds their confidence up. Another reason summer projects should be student-designed is because they better the student skills. For example, when I go off too college the projects will be easier to me because Im¬†already experienced, also if i was to do a presentation I would know what certain points I want to say, and what parts I would like to start from.

There additional reasons why a student-designed summer project is more beneficial. Students can show the project to their friends and family, and that would help because if the student is wrong on some parts of the project they have people around that can correct them. However, when students show their project to their friends and family that can help better the student presentation and social skills. Due to the summer being a break from school, students have a lot of time to work on the project. For example, no one is rushing the student, therefore, the student can add extra work. The summer gives the students a lot of time to be more unique. Also, summer projects that are student-designed are better because the teacher may want the students to turn the project in earlier than expected. Another additional reason is that student-designed projects may be easier, because the student might not understand how the teacher designed it, or may not understand the instructions. For example, if summer already started and the student did not understand the teacher instructions, the student can ask the teacher to email the instructions to them.

Although some may disagree, projects should be student-designed. During the summer student-designed projects are best because they better student's skills, student have a lot of time to work on the project, and students can understand the project better. There are those who argue that teacher-designed projects are best, but this is not true. Ultimately, student-designed projects are better because they persuade students be more unique and creative.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
40458848F6B5,"Many studnets use computers in class but ther is also a large portion that do not on a day to day basiss. The thought of computers being able to read expressions is pretty fasinating, however seem unnessisary. Like hummans computers make mistakes; the Facial Action Coding System could inaccutartly change a lesson plan, missread an expression, or not pick up an expression .

At school students do get bored, but the teacher does not change the lesson plan so why should the computer. All the evidence is a prediction with no hard evidience backing it; ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts"". In class students ask questions or go to a teacher when they do not get it so a computer would not be much of a help unless it was for kids who did online school and did not have a teacher helping them through the lessons.

Most students are not nessisarly excited about school so they quite regularly wear a bored expression throughout the day. Not to mention ""each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no expression)"". Some kids just do not show emotion especialy older kids who just want to get what needs to be done finished. What if a kid is genuinly confussed and the computre missreads the expression. that could either cause more confussion as the lesson goes on or make the lesson too easy.

Computers make errors all the time they are no where near perfection. What if the computer does not have the sennsors to pick up expression. It is not like every school or home schooled student is going to go out and buy a computer that can do the same thing a parent or teacher can do. This invention ""stores similar anatomical information as electronic code"". The Facial Action Coding System is amazing to show expressions in art work, but not for students.

While coputres do aid us at many things there are somethings that should just be left to us to do. Students get confused and bored by many things but that can all be fixed by a little bit of help. If the student is really that confused then maybe that program is not for them. As well as if the student does not show emtion while doing work on the computer. It is a neat idea but it should not be brought into the classroom. Its more trouble than what it is worth.          ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
9996C0482579,"Phones and Driving

Cell phones and cars are not a good mix and people should never try and use both at the same time. Using both phone and car at the same time can cause a major accident and can cause people to get hurt because someone wanted to use their phone while they drove their car. When you use your phone while driving you are putting more than yourself at risk of losing your life you also endanger the person you crash into and whoever you or they have in the car. When these two items mix it is no good for anybody especially the ones on the street.

The world is a very exciting place and there is so much to do and can even do multiple things at once, but somethings shouldn't be done while another is happening. Being on your phone while driving is one of the many things you shouldn't do it causes accidents that will leave someone badly damaged or without their life. When someone loses their life their family will grieve and you shouldn't want to be the cause of their or your family's grief so you should take precautions that you stay out of situations that could put you in the wrong spotlight.

On average 11 teens die a day from texting and driving. These are people who just wanted to see what their friends had to say or what's trending on instagram. As sad as it is, these people didn't take good precautions before they took off in the car, they just wanted to arrive at the location they were headed too. They didn't think that they were going to lose their life from texting and driving. People should learn from others' mistakes and shouldn't text and drive knowing it is dangerous.

There are over 2.35 million people in the United States today that are injured or disabled due to a car crash, and there are more than 330,000 of those accidents due to Texting and driving. When a person text while driving there is never a good outcome of them doing that a young teen or an older person or there self ends up getting hurt in the process. The generation today's technology has drastically increased. People are so reliant on the use of their phones and more things. Nowadays a lot of people don't even like to have a phone conversation simply because they can send it through a text. The conclusion of all the car wrecks the accident is mostly caused by a person wanting to text while driving .

The purpose of this essay is to give you some information on why you shouldn't text and drive at the same times. People always think they have to immediately have to respond to a text this is why many of the accidents occur. The ages that always cause accidents are the teens the ages from 17 and up they always act like soon as they hear that ding they have to check their phone. Don't text and drive text there is never a good outcome of that, think about your life and others. Text and drive doesn't mix you need your eyes on the road you can not text and drive, don't even think about picking your phone up. If you even think about picking your phone up just pause and think about how many lives you will be putting at risk by picking up your phone.

8034A75C0798,"Cellular phones are not to be used in the driver seat. In this essay, I will explain how drivers should not be able to use cellular phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. People in the world today are glued and stuck to their cellular phones because of this world being technology driven. Cellular phones are now smart phones, literally walking computers.

That's wonderful in its place; however, putting your life and others lives in danger while using cellular phones while driving is the issue of today.

The numbers showing the danger of cellular phones used while driving a vehicle are very scary. In fact, at any given time throughout the day, approximately 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their cellular phones while behind the wheel of an automobile, and 3,328 people were killed during the year of 2018 which was the most during 2018- 2020.

A vehicle needs your undivided attention because you are not driving for yourself, you are driving for others. People get very distracted by things such as texts, calls, or even music. In my opinion, this generation cannot multitask so they put their mind on one thing and stick to that. This is usually the cellular phone and not the road while driving the vehicle.

In my conclusion, life is more important than a text or a Direct Message when driving a motor vehicle. We shouldn't just think about ourselves, but think about other drivers on the road, and help everyone get back home safe and sound to their loved ones.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
7C2974EB31DD,"If i was a scientist at NASA and had to do research on of the face that is on mars i would say it isnt a human face. I think it is just a natural landform.

My evidence that the face is not really a human being is first of all it doesnt even have a body. Since they took pictures of the face, they could have croped the pictures to look real. In the pictures that scientists took of the face in 1976 to 2001 the pictures look nothing like a face. The pictures show cracks that may appear to look like a face but really isnt.

When a scientist was taking a picture on mars he noticed an enormous head nearly two miles from one end to the other end and it seemed that it was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called cyndonia. The cause of that could have been a shadow and not a human looking back at him. Another thing is that i dont think they seen a Martian because when they said that they had pictures of a Martian, picture cant always be true because of how people crop pictures today.

So these are my reasons why i think that that face is not really a face, just a natural landform. A lot of people may believe what thay want to believe. Just remember that eveybody has there own opinion.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

D1ACADAC5ED4,"School is not exactly something everyone looks forward to nowadays. Teenagers are depressed, anxious, and some incredibly sick. It is so difficult to avoid some of the negative things in life when a student is constantly surrounded by peer pressure and bullying. If given the choice, many students would most likely choose to skip school and stay at home. However, if a student was given the option to attend classes from home, it would be beneficial. This is because¬†it allows those who get sick to stay caught up and protects those who get bullied and assaulted in school.

First, online classes by way of video conference are very helpful to those who are sick because they are still able to be taught by a teacher. Many students come into school even if they are sick. This causes an illness to spread around the entire student body just because one student couldn't miss class. On the other hand, if a student stays home because they are sick, they miss a lot of classwork and aren't able to pay attend the important lessons being taught. One time, I had to stay home because of a stomach bug. I got behind in my classes and was never really able to understand the concepts as well as I could have if I was taught by my teacher like everyone else. I got a very bad grade on the test on these concepts because I was not able to catch up. If I was able to call in to my missed classes, I would have benefited greatly because I could ask questions if I had any, hear the teacher's explanation, and see how the teacher would solve the problem instead of having to figure it all out on my own. On a more serious level, there are some kids who are, unfortunately, terminally ill. They are either physically unable to go to school because of their type of illness or aren't allowed to go out very often because of the risks and dangers they could face. They are more prone to your typical cold and flu, and it is deadlier for them. If they were able to sit in on their classes through a video conference, then they could still feel like they are going to high school like a ""normal"" teenager. Overall, even if attending classes online was only available to those who are sick, it would still help so many kids.

Video conferences and attending classes online are also beneficial to a different demographic, those who are bullied and assaulted. To protect those who fear going to school because they are constantly putting themselves in danger, the school could give them this option of learning from home. There are so many stories of kids getting beat up at school and the school not trying to fix things or not being able to fix things, and this is a way that the schools can help be a part of the solution. There are also numerous stories of students getting sexually assaulted and raped. These students go through every day, trying to avoid those horrible people who did this horrible thing to them, wondering why they have to put in so much work just so this doesn't happen to them again. The book

Speak brings a lot of light on this issue. The main character goes through this avoiding process and, in the end, is unable to completely avoid her rapist. She finds it extremely difficult to see him in school, acting as if he hasn't done anything wrong. If she was given the option to do online schooling, I bet she would have done it in a heartbeat. She dreaded going to school every day and this extra option would have been a godsend for her. Sometimes, you have to take things into your own hands, and if that means making the decision to do schooling from home, then you do what you gotta do.

Some may say that students and teenagers need a chance to socially interact with others, and school helps provide that. But, everyone has people they interact with outside of school. Whether it be in the neighborhood or at church, there are many other ways to get your social fix in. Take home-schooled kids, for example. They might be home alone all day trying to get their schoolwork done, but home-schooled students¬†have these groups called co-ops. These co-ops are groups of other students that are home-schooled that come to learn altogether. This helps those who are home-schooled get themselves some time with other students.

There are many benefits to having another option for students who are sick and kids who get assaulted and bullied. Many of today's societal issues, whether it be new illnesses spreading or more and more students getting hurt and going to school in fear, affect a teenager's school life. The less focused we are on the issues going on outside of school, the more we are able to focus on what could impact our future. School is vital to our future in today's world, and the administration needs to realize that there are things taking away our focus from school. Teenagers are the future of this world, and the past generations need to realize that things are different that they were in their time. Would you want your children to go to school living in fear? Well, they already are.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
C75471F5ED96,"Summer projects allow students to have the opportunity to learn while they are not in school and it can benefit them in many ways. Summer projects should be designed by students because it gives students the opportunity to learn more about something of their choice, it shows that they have a connection with the project, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things.

Students should be given the opportunity to create a project about something of their choice. It gives them independence and the ability to rely on themselves. It is good to give students independence starting at a young age because it allows them to be self reliant. Giving students the opportunity to create a project based on their own ideas and their own planning, will allow for success later in life.

Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it will show the teacher how much of a connection they have to the topic. Teachers love when a student creates a well designed and well thought out project. If a student were to be given a project designed by the teacher, the student would feel like they couldn't do much with it because they have no connection with it. When students have a connection with something it makes them feel more enthusiastic about the project or assignment given to them.

Students are more eager to learn about new things after they researched something of their choice. When students have a choice, they would rather research something that they don't know too much about. After that topic is researched they feel enlightened. Students also tend to branch off of the topic that they first researched as well. This technique is often used by students because it makes research easier for them and they like to make things easier for them rather than harder.

In conclusion, Students should be able to design their own summer projects because it gives them new opportunities, it shows that they can connect to something, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things. Although teachers can provide students with a base and a template for their project, it would be best and beneficial for students to be able to create and think of something on their own.

llama_70b_v1334,"I think that summer projects should be student-designed. It's important for students to have the opportunity to take ownership of their learning and have a say in what they want to learn. When students are able to design their own projects, they are more invested in the learning process and are more likely to be motivated to complete the project. This also helps students develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and time management.

Additionally, student-designed projects allow for more creativity and innovation. Students are able to choose topics that they are passionate about and design projects that are tailored to their interests. This can lead to more engaging and meaningful learning experiences. For example, a student who is interested in photography can design a project that involves taking pictures of different landmarks in their community, while a student who is interested in science can design a project that involves conducting experiments and collecting data.

On the other hand, teacher-designed projects can be too rigid and may not take into account the individual interests and needs of each student. When teachers design projects, they may have a set outcome in mind and may not be open to changes or modifications. This can limit the creativity and autonomy of students and may lead to a less engaging learning experience.

However, it's also important to note that some students may struggle with designing their own projects, especially if they lack experience or confidence. In these cases, teachers can provide guidance and support to help students develop their ideas and ensure that their projects are feasible and aligned with learning objectives.

In conclusion, student-designed summer projects offer many benefits for students, including increased motivation, creativity, and autonomy. While there may be some challenges to implementing student-designed projects, with the right support and guidance from teachers, students can have valuable learning experiences that they will remember long after the summer break is over.",1,llama_70b_v1,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

First of all, speed limit would be followed by everyone. Usually people don't drive the speed limit. If driverless cars happen, then we can make them go the speed limit. I think going the actual speed limit will reduce car accidents.

Second of all, the person in the car could still take control of the vehicle if needed. This is a good thing because if a turn or park is to difficult for the car itself, then the driver can take control and do the obstacle for the car. This will prevent the car from malfunctioning.

Finally, I think it will make it easier on a lot of people. If someone is handicapped the car is there to just drive for them if they can't drive for a long time. I also personally think it will reduce accidents because of how fast you are going.

limiting car usage will also improve the conditions of our environment, by not using cars as much as we do we can reduce greenhouse gases, which could help preserve the ozone layer. According to source 2 ''

But, do you know if the student knows what he/she needs to know?. In some cases students didn't remenber something from high school. Many students forget everything that they learned when is Summer or when they stop to go to the school, in a very short time. It depend from the knowledge of a students if he/she can take everything on his/her heat. May be more time led the students to know what they want to do after the High School, and have elective classes can help the students to be a good worker in the future because they are more creative.

Depend from the knowledge of the student if he/she can take everything on his/her heat because some students have the capacity to learn a lot without forgered and other not, possibly they have apathy in some classes or they are more interested in other things since in some school districts offer progams that can contein clases that students don't want to learn. But, it can be very helpfull for the students that want to graduate so fast from the high school becuse may be they want to work without a interuption from high school's things or the want to go the colledge without they had a lot of time in high school. Also, some students think that have the capacity to graduate from high school in a short time and other prefert to graduate with the normal years because some students want to have the advanced diploma that can give you goods oprtunities.

May be more time led the students to know what they want to do after high school because some students graduated so fast that they didn't thing correcly what they want to be or what to do after the high, someway you have do to something in your life that can help you to live ecconimicaly between the world. For example, you are graduate today but in a week or a month you are doing nothing because you don't know what you want to do but you need something with your life. Also, if you want to graduate so fast from high school you need a plan like; i'll work after high school because i need money, or i want to study more because i think i need to know more and i want in my future. For example: the people who work after high school is the people that knows whar they want without matter the time that they took in the high school and the people who still stiding is because they arenot ready to know what they want or they still studing for a carrer.

Have elective classes can help the students to be a good worker in the future because they are more creative, and elective clasess led the students to learnd new things that can help them in the future and in their usually life. For example: if they take an art class they will be more creative, if they take a music art they can have their own record. Also , elective class give more oportunities that a progam that conteins the usually class and borred. Finally, summer is a good time to take a break from high school and you have the oportunity to be in a class

Online if it's difficult for you to remenber something during that time.

In conclusion, some programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years are good for the students who knows what they want to do after the high schools like if they want to work or if they will still studing. Also take a little bit time to graduate is not to bad because you never will to know what new things can you learn in the elapse of the time you keep have the oportunity to think more in what to do in the future. Also, if you have the capacity to remenber things for a log time is not too bad the idea to graduate in three years.

9655269C8247,"No one wants to wach ads but wouldnt they be more intresting if there was a way they could relate to us more. In the article ¬®Making Mona Lisa Smile¬®by Nick D¬¥Alto he talks about a way that a coding system can read our emoitions.

In the text they talk about a program called Facial Action Coding System that will use our emotions to make our experience with technology better.

The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valiable because ads can be more personal, it can help keep students more intrested, and can make animated faces more expressive.

Ads are an example on how the Facial Action Coding System can be valuable. In the text it states ¬®For example, if yoy smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be dirffent.¬® (D¬¥Alto).

So if a student is doing somthing on a computer and an ad pops up for a math game and he dosnt like it the next ad could change to a math game that he does help.

The ads coud help the student find a game that can help him learn. Ads and keeping the student mare intrested are ways the Facial Action Coding System is valuble.

Keeping the students intrested is also another way the Facial Action Coding System can be benifical to a student. In the text it says ¬®A classroom computer coud recognize when a student is becoming confused¬® (Dr. Huange).

If it could reconize that then it could modifiy the lession.

The lession would be better for a student and also it would be like having a teacher right next to you teaching you in the way you learn best.

Keeping the students intrested is anothe way the Facial Action Coding System can be valiuble but there is one more example.

The Facial Action Coding System can make animated faces more expressive.

The author states ¬® The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive¬® (D¬¥Alto).

When taking an online corse if a animated faces could be more expressive it would make the student more involved.

Also it could make the student feel like they have some one to help right next to them.

This is how making animated faces more expressive can help students in a classroom.

This is how ads can be more personal, it can help keep students more intrested, and can make animated faces more expressive help support the claim that the use of emotinal reading technology can be valuable for a student.

By making things more personal.

Also by keeping the student intrested so they dont get side tracked. Finaly by keeping the student happy.

Wouldent you want a more presnal expericence when learning to help keep you intrested and more involved?    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
709156BCF733,"In summary, due to a growing awareness of students‚Äô academic performance and the increasing necessity for them to reach a certain level of academic achievement, many schools have implemented policies that require students to obtain a certain grade average to be eligible to participate in sports.

The primary benefit of these policies is that it encourages students to strive for higher academic achievement while in school, as grades are an important factor both in eligibility to participate in sports and further educational opportunities like college and technical training. Furthermore, these policies also encourage students to prioritize their school work over sports, reducing the potential for academic neglect.

At the same time, however, there are significant drawbacks to these policies. Lower-income students, students with English as a second language, or students with learning disabilities or other special needs may struggle to meet these standards, putting them at a significant disadvantage as far as participation in school sports is concerned. In addition, some have criticized the policies for stigmatizing students who don‚Äôt reach the grade average, creating a potentially negative atmosphere in the school.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

B1687066F985,"With the growth of technology, options, other than the traditional schooling, have developed, leaving schools to wonder if they should adapt to the new technologies by allowing classes to be attended online via video conference. Although some may believe otherwise, students can benefit from being able to attend online class from home because students can manage their time and can work at their own pace.

First of all, students will benefit from online class because they can manage their own time. For instance, my friend Generic_Name, who is a dancer and soccer player, takes classes online, so she has more time to attend her ballet classes and club soccer practices everyday. Because Generic_Name does not have to get dressed or commute to and from school, she can focus that additional time to dedicate to her interest in dance and sports while still maintaining her education. In addition, after my ACL and meniscus surgery, I had to take a week off of school to recover, which is a difficult amount of time to miss when being enrolled in all AP and honors courses. In preparation for my surgery, I asked all my teachers for notes and assignments that I would be missing, however, I only anticipated to miss half a week, so I was two days behind on my school work. With online classes, I could have managed more time to allow for a proper recovery and would not have fallen behind. Thus, online classes are useful in facilitating the growth of other interests and compensating for states of emergency where one may not be able to physically attend school.

Secondly, students will benefit from attending class online because they can work at their own pace. In U.S. History, for instance, my teacher Generic_Name would talk through the notes very quickly, so it was difficult for me to keep up, especially since I am a slow writer. Fortunately, Generic_Name makes the powerpoints available on blackboard, so I use that during class, but I am so invested in trying to write down all the notes that I miss the important information that he was explaining. In this situation, it would have been beneficial to attend that class from home because I could listen to his lecture intently and then take the notes afterward, which I would not have been able to do in class because Generic_Name disapproves of people not taking notes. Additionally, precalculus is a particularly easy class for me, so I often find myself sitting at my desk doing nothing after finishing the practice problems early. If I were to attend class online, I would be able to finish the lesson quickly and efficiently, shortening a 90 minute lesson to 30. Therefore, online courses enables students to utilize the time needed to take in and comprehend a lesson.

Some may disagree that students should be able to attend class online because students may easily get distracted at home, making their learning ineffective. This reasoning is plausible, however, in my experience, there are far more distractions at school than at home in isolation. For instance, in my Spanish class, the students were extremely loud and talkative because their was a substitute teacher, which affected me, a student who actually wanted to learn, since my mind could not properly process the information with all the noise in the room. When I got home from school, I worked on the assignment that I couldn't finish in class and was able to do it in only fifteen minutes because I could think more clearly with nothing but the serene silence filling up the room. Furthermore, in AP psychology, I sit next to my best friend Generic_Name, and, despite my best efforts to pay attention in class, I get distracted because the two of us talk and goof around, whereas, at home, I can concentrate on my work for hours when I am alone. Overall, distractions like friends and disruptive classmates can make learning in school difficult, so taking class from home in isolation may be even more effective than physically being in school.

To conclude, students can reap many benefits from online classes that would facilitate their growth both in and out of school. Attending class online gives the student control of learning in a way that is preferrable to them, which is important because then students will comprehend more and learn effectively, and gives the opportunity to explore interests with the extra time at hand to grow as an individual. It would be an absolute waste of resources if schools failed to take advantage of such technologies that could improve students' education and well-being. Not only is the availability of online classes beneficial to the students, but it is useful in an emergency such as a threat of a school shooting, which is unfortunately a prominent issue and possibility in the modern world, or a viral outbreak. Technology has changed drastically from when the school system was first established and normalized and so has society, so it's imperative that the schools take action to adapt to the changing world, especially now in the wake of a global pandemic.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,8
777CB894A285,"In today's rapidly changing world, having multiple skills is becoming increasingly important. While it may seem tempting to specialize in one area and become an expert, the reality is that having a diverse set of skills can actually be more beneficial in the long run. In this essay, I will argue that knowing several skills rather than just one can provide numerous advantages, including increased employability, higher earning potential, and greater personal fulfillment.

First and foremost, having multiple skills can greatly increase one's employability. In today's job market, employers are increasingly looking for candidates who can bring a variety of skills to the table. This is because having multiple skills allows employees to be more flexible and adaptable, which can be particularly valuable in industries that are rapidly changing. For example, a person who is skilled in both programming and design could be an asset to a company that is developing a new software product. Similarly, a person who is proficient in both marketing and finance could be a valuable asset to a company that is looking to expand into new markets.

Secondly, having multiple skills can also lead to higher earning potential. This is because having multiple skills makes an individual more valuable to their employer, which can lead to higher salaries and more opportunities for advancement. For example, a person who is skilled in both marketing and finance may be eligible for a higher salary than someone who is only skilled in one of those areas. Additionally, having multiple skills can make an individual more attractive to potential employers, which can lead to more job offers and higher salaries.

Finally, having multiple skills can also lead to greater personal fulfillment. When people have multiple skills, they are often able to pursue a wider range of interests and passions. This can lead to a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment in life. For example, a person who is skilled in both photography and music may be able to pursue a career as a photographer or a musician, or they may be able to combine the two and become a music photographer. This kind of flexibility and creativity can be incredibly rewarding and fulfilling.

In conclusion, having multiple skills rather than just one can provide numerous benefits. It can increase employability, lead to higher earning potential, and lead to greater personal fulfillment. While it may seem tempting to specialize in one area, the reality is that having a diverse set of skills can be incredibly valuable in today's rapidly",1,llammistral7binstruct,,9
9B4C52064991,"In recent years, many local companies and organizations have implemented initiatives to better engage with students from different schools. Employers have provided support in order to encourage student involvement in various professions. This helps to provide students with an insight into the real-world of work.

For one, many employers may not provide adequate guidance and counseling to the students on how to pursue the profession they are interested in.

A00EFF7056C4,"First, I agree and disagree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, do you? I think some students like learning by themselves, but some get distracted or may even rely on someone to show them the ways of learning. If the student works better on their own than I think classes at home is a great option. Therefore, the parents and their child should sit down and plan a learning schedule for them to follow full of due dates, so then, they don't fall behind. If the student has trouble working alone than I don't think classes at home is the best option, so there might be another reason why the student doesn't want to go to school, such as, being bullied or no friends. Lastly, parents might not even be there all the time to help their child or they don't know how to answer your questions they have.

Secondly, do you work independently? Some students work better by themselves and some don't. If your student decides to have classes at home than I think their should be a meeting of some type with the parents and child to dicuss it. If they agree, I think they need to sit down and create a work pace schedule full of due dates so the chilid doesn't fall behind. Maybe the student has trouble focusing around others and wants to learn from home. The greatest thing about working at home is the student can work at their own pace. Then, they can do other things during the day and get their work done before the due date instead of rushing at school to get the things done in one night that you got the same day. Sometimes it may help the student work harder when they work at their own pace.

Third, some students work better with others. They might need help on an assignment or they might even need help understanding something no one around them knows either. Some get distracted or even do other things to get their mind off of doing work, for an example, going out with friends, cleaning the house, getting on social media by using their phones or even watching television. All those things are distracting for everyone. Sometimes, there might be another reason why the student doesn't want to go to school and is eager to stay home. Maybe they're getting bullied by another kid at school or they don't have friends to hang out with. The question mostly every parent asks when the child stays home a lot from school is ""Is something happening at school I don't know about?"". Most of time the child doesn't want to tell their parents they don't have friends or are being bullied because they don't want to start something or even talk with their parents about it, so then they make up an excuse to stay home.

Last but not least, parents can't help all the time. Parents may have to work and are too busy. They might not remember learning about the things we learn now because time changes. They might've done things differently or didn't think it was important for their future job so they didn't listen much. Some might check up on their child and they might consider lying and telling them they finshed their work for the month but haven't even started. They might think their child is doing good and is learning what they need but when they go to take their GED they might fail according to the lack of learning they had. Therefore, it's important for family to help you sometimes but most of the time you have to learn things on your own in your own way to get anywhere in life.

Lastly, I think students should have an opinion on wheither they want to work at home or in schools. If they want to work at home, than I think there should be lots of planning and talking involved. Maybe when the parents think their child is ready, they can make a decision. Sometimes, classes at home aren't meant to be for some students. No parent wants their child to do bad in life and not get the education they need but also, want their child to feel comfortable by getting the learning they need to accomplish future life goals.¬†¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,0

2E7B7DA84C7A,"On May 24, 2001, a NASA Viking 1 spacecraft had saw a landform on Mars that had happened to look like a human face. The spacecraft had taken pictures of this landform and show the world a few days later in order to attract people to Mars. Some people, like conspiracy theorists, say that it's evidence of alien life that NASA has hidden from the public, but if this had been something NASA was hiding, they wouldn't have show that photo at all to the public. Scientists and astronaunts have denied this by adding titles that suggest otherwise on there photos, showing the photo in the first place, and going back up to space to take more pictures.

According to paragraphs 1 though 5, NASA had found a landforn that resembled a human face of an Egyptian Pharaoh located on a region called Cydonia. Mission control was surprised to see the face, but believed it was just another Martian mesa with unusual shadows, so they decided to reveal the pictures to the media, knowing there wasn't anything ""top secret"" or alien like about it. Then, according to paragraph 5, NASA had captioned the image, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth,"" basically telling the public that it was just a quirky looking natural landform, not a big alien conspiracy theory. People defending the NASA budget even claimed they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars, basically meaning there wasn't life that they knew of. Finally, in paragraph 7, another NASA spacecraft went over Cydonia on APril 5, 1998 and took better, sharper pictures, showing that it was just a natural landform that didn't have a civilization in it.

In conlusion, NASA was not trying to hide a whole big alien civilization theory from the world. They had just saw a cool natural landform with weird shadows that made it look like a human face and decided to share it with the world. If there was a conspiracy, NASA wouldn't have showed the picture to the world, added a title stating that it was an artifact, or have willingly went back up to space to take another picture of the landform. Therefore, NASA is not hiding any ancient alien civilizations from the United States, or any other part of the world.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
llama_70b_v132,"Hi, my name is Jill and I'm a scientist at NASA. I'm here to tell you that the Face on Mars is not created by aliens, it's just a natural landform. Some people might say that it looks like a face, but that's just a coincidence.

First of all, let's look at the evidence. The Face is located in a region of Mars called Cydonia, which is known for its unusual terrain. The Face itself is a large, flat-topped mesa with two smaller mesas on either side. This formation is actually pretty common on Mars, and it's caused by the planet's geology. The article we read says that the mesas are probably formed by the erosion of lava flows, which created a series of flat-topped hills. That's why the Face looks so flat and smooth.

Another thing that's important to know is that the Face is not a recent discovery. It was first spotted in 1976 by NASA's Viking spacecraft, and it's been studied ever since. If it was created by aliens, don't you think we would have found some other evidence of it by now? Like, maybe some alien artifacts or something? But we haven't found anything like that.

Also, the article says that the Face is not even a face at all! It's just a chance alignment of features that makes it look like a face. The scientists who studied it say that the ""eyes"" are actually just two small craters, and the ""mouth"" is a curved slope. That's not exactly what I would call a face, you know?

So, what do you think? Do you still think the Face on Mars was created by aliens? I don't think so. I think it's just a natural landform that happens to look a little bit like a face. And that's pretty cool, if you ask me!

Conclusion:

So, there you have it. The Face on Mars is not a sign of alien life, it's just a natural part of the planet's geology. I hope I've convinced you that the Face is not created by aliens, but is instead a fascinating landform that we can learn more about through science.

2C7E32EF3F72,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa smile"" the author describes how a new technology Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I think this technology would not have much use in a classroom. There are so many emotions that go on in the human brain on a daily consistent basis, there is just no possible way that artificial intelligence could make an accurate reading on a student. For example humans are not these focus machines that only think about school work while they are doing it, a student could easily get side tracked and think about somthing else, whether it be a sad or happy emotion this could theoretically set off the Facial Coding System and give the student an inaccurate reading. Another real life example is, say a student is working on his math problems and the student totally gets the problems and it is a breeze, but say he gets sidetracked and thinks about something else earlier in the day that puzzled him, what if the Facial Coding system picked that up? It clearly would not give an accurate reading, hypothetically it would pick up the students confusion and move him onto another question. The problem with the Facial Coding Systerm is that it wouldn't be analyzing a perfect subject, what I mean by that is that humans clearly have error, what I mean by that is if the Facial Coding System were engaged on a student I feel like it would have a hard time getting an accurate reading on how the student is ACTUALLY doing on their school work. Not only would this system most likely be very inaccurate, but what about the cost of the Facial Coding System. Technology and artificial intelligence like this would be outrageously expensive, so not only would this system most likely be ineffective but it would also be very pricey, imagine the thousands of kids in each public school, then add the expense of the coding system on each of their computers, school funding may not even be enough to fund all of that let alone the students who would be paying for them, it is just not realistic at all. In conclusion I think that the Facial Action Coding System would be both an ineffective and expensive product that schools certainly could not utilize or benefit from it at all.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
7780043938EE,"When¬†it comes to advice, it's very important that you are getting the correct advice. Receiving wrong advice can be a vital mistake in whatever you're doing. Asking only one individual can lead you to the wrong advice. One person limits yourself to the knowledge and experience you could've received from various people. That is why it's very important to listen to multiple inputs on how other people feel.

Receiving advice from one person is not always the smartest decision. Asking someone who lacks knowledge in that topic has a high chance of giving you wrong information. Asking multiple people who have knowledge about that topic will most likely give great advice. Multiple people with great knowledge will help you have the retain the most knowledge.

Only one person limits the advice you get from¬†experienced people. Asking a person that is not very experienced will not help as much than various people with experience. Even if only one person is very experienced, two experienced people will help more. Two minds are greater than one!

Listening to Multiple opinions for advice is important for advice. Only getting one opinion is not smart. Different opinions can help you make smart choices. Multiple people can give you different inputs that you can narrow down by yourself. Giving yourself options to choose¬†from will help you make the better choice.

All of these reasons are reasons why people shouldnt just seek one person for advice. Receiving advice from various people with knowledge and experience is the best way to go. Listening to multiple opinions will help you choose the best option.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,2
AFBC394080FC,"Ralph Waldo Emerson famously stated that, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" This idea is particularly relevant today, as we live in a world that is constantly trying to homogenize individuals and force them to fit into a predetermined mold. 

Take for example the world of professional sports; many athletes face immense pressure from the industry to attain a certain look, play style, or attitude in order to be successful. There is a pervasive attitude that there is only one way to ""be a star,"" and athletes who don't fit that mold can be easily cast aside or ignored. Those who ultimately succeed are those who have managed to stay true to themselves and their unique styles despite all the external pressure.

Another example of this trend can be seen in education. Now more than ever before, young people are placed into rigid curriculums and systems that emphasize conformity and orthodoxy rather than individual initiative and personal growth. Unfortunately, this approach often leads to a narrow definition of success and achievement that fails to account for the unique qualities of each individual student. Those who ultimately succeed in this system are those that have managed to stay true to their own passions and interests, regardless of what standard measures of success may dictate. 

In conclusion, it is clear that Emerson‚Äôs idea of individuality is more important than ever, and that success depends on staying true to yourself rather than conforming to a predetermined mold. By following this idea, individuals can achieve greatness and make meaningful contributions to society on their own terms.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Write an essay exploring the idea that Emerson‚Äôs statement about individuality is correct, providing real-world examples and experiences that illustrate this concept.",0
DF2BE9E97393,"Ever since it was first invented, the automobile has proved to be very important and practical for people all over the globe.¬† In the current century, however, the demand for the car has begun to see a potential disappearance, as¬† people are beginning to discover that there are advantages to minimizing their dependence on their vehicles. Limiting car usage has several very influential advantages, such as increasing mental health, reducing air pollution, and eliminating problems associated with traffic.

First of all, studies have proven that the use of automobiles is linked to the levels of stress and unhappiness that people feel. Source one elaborates on this by discussing a city in Germany that decided to give up cars. It quotes a woman who says that when she had a car she was always tense, but living in Vauban (the car- free city) has made her much happier. She is able to walk or bike everywhere that she needs to be in town. This opportunity to increase happiness is also mentioned in source three, which quotes a businessman who says that limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress."" The alternative he choses is to ride a tandem bike with his wife. This allows for more bonding with his wife as well as increasing their physical health, which plays a vital role in mental health as well.

As of recently, the impact that cars have on the enviroment has gained more attention as well as increased concern. All vehicles emit greenhouse gasses, which are very harmful to the enviroment, causing smog and damage to the atmosphere. According to source one, limiting the use of passenger cars could reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 percent. Source two describes how the accumulation of smog in Paris became so bad that it caused official bans on the use of cars. It took an entire week of restricting car usage to get the smog to clear up. Source four also agrees that the results of limiting car usage would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Source one mentions that as a result of all of this, the Enviromental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting car reduced communities.

Lastly, limiting car usage eliminates all problems associated with traffic. Traffic creates many problems for people, from increasing danger to wasting time. Limiting car usage would immidately reduce traffic substantially. This could prevent people from being stuck on their way home during rush-hour every day.¬† Having cars speeding by, in residential areas especially, increases the level of danger for pedestrians. There are many casualties that happen every year due to automobile accidents. Limiting car usage would easily eliminate this problem. It would also eliminate the problem of drunk driving and the dangers associated with it. Source four supports this claim by stating that limiting car usage would in fact improve safety.

Limiting car usage has many advantages, and therefore should definately be taken into consideration. Doing this would not only increase mental health and wellbeing, but would also save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety. ¬† ¬† ¬†       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
F9FA6D6CF768,"I am against the idea of designing Driveless cars. For the simple reason, they may be more likeyl to cause accidents and you would be held responsible for the accident although you weren't controlling the steering wheel or the gas pedal. Althought it does seem like a good idea to have driveless cars, what were to happen if one day you got in an accident and the other drives tried to hold you responsible? If we all got to where we are driving driveless cars, there would be nobody held accountable for the accident and how would the accident damage be paid for? The good thing is that if you were on along road trip and needed to take a rest you wouldn't have to pull of to the side of the road you could just keep going and the car would drive for you. I have to say I do agree witht the vehicles that assist you when you drive tough busy areas or work areas, that is fine but if we were to make a car that did all the driving we would get bored and probably fall asleep driving. Which in the long run will cause accidents, as I said before accidents would be hard to decide who caused them. So I would say in the long run drivelss cars are a bad idea.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
7B5BC2343286,"In some Societies, students are expecting to identify a career by the time they enter to high school,Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific careers and take the classes they need for the career to practices more and be more specific in the career and have more thinks to know how it work for them, in some career they need a lot of think to try it and they need practice to be in high level of the career and at young age they are expecting what career they want to take when they get older and get to high school.

I think that's good idea for students to commit to a career at young age, because some career are really hard to take it and if they start talking about what career they can take from young age, they would know more about how the career work, and before they get to high school some of them would know what kinda of classes they can take and how it work to get better practice in the career because some career are really hard to take it, but some are not that hard to take it, but in high school they are many classes about careers and they talk about it and it work.

When they get to high school, they can ask what are better courses for this career and what is better for this career and get information. When they are younger they are thinking in many career and they talk to the teacher whats better in this career and what kinda classes they can help and bring up better in the career, When they get to high school the thinking in many more career and getting more ideas about careers and see which one is better and talk about it. and when they get age when they have take classes for the career they getting more ideas about the career.

By the time of the classes they meet someone who knows the about careers and they ask what they need for take classes, and visit the college or make a field trip and meet with the company of the career,

before they get to high school, they trying to be better in every classes they have and have good grades and take important classes that work for the career and trying to take everything what they need for the career and important thinks learning everything.

Most students from young age are thinking in career, when they start middle school are think what kinda of career they can take when they get to high school, and when they get to high school they are looking for the classes about their career, and see what can they do to learn more about what they think in their career and see how can they do to take it, and do the best with their classes to complete the career for their job and take about what they need for the college.

I think that's a good idea to be thinking from young age, so when they get to high school they already know what career they gonna take and what kinda classes they work for their career and be prepared for collage, and from younger age they are learning more about what they wanna be when they get older, When they get to their college they would have more experience with their career, because they start thinking from young and they take course that help for their dreams with the career.",0,original_moth,"Task: Research career options by speaking with teachers in middle school, visiting colleges, and making field trips to relevant companies.

1B069ADEF513,"The student council is holding a meeting at the cafeteria while the school basketball team is practicing for their upcoming game. These things are called extracurricular activities. The principle has decided these things are mandatory. I think students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because students schedules and students being forced to do something they¬†dont want to do.

Lots of students have busy lives. Students and their parents could have something planned or reserved for a certain time.( going to parties, a get together, vacations/trips, shopping etc.) The activity and plan might collide, which probably¬†would cause rescheduling and chaos. Students could also already have an activity outside of school. How I see it in my mind is that if someone already takes a sport (outside of school) and now has to take another activity in school. They would have less time, less motivation, and more work. Our four core classes and two electives already give us plenty of homework to do. Doing an activity will require more effort and less time to do the homework from our classes. Whether it be a writing assignment for the student council, doing work for the yearbook club or practicing for a sport.

Students may feel forced to do an activity they dont like. For some kids their might not be an activity they enjoy and then proceed to pick one they dont like. Doing this could make them resent school or feel some type of sadness. Their also could be a large demand for one activity a student has applied for. After applying the student learns hes been excluded because of maximum limit of people in one club. The student is now in a club he doesn't enjoy. If I was in the student shoes i would feel like the school has been unfair or betrayed me. Being forced to do something is almost never a good thing. especially if you don't enjoy it. Forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do could cause a state of depression, anxiety or a fear of it.

However, participating in extracurricular activities would mean less screen time. Students can socialize and plus most teenagers are addicted to their phones and its not healthy for them at all. Doing activities will decrease the time by a good percentage. Being addicted to anything is definitely not healthy but, being forced to do something isnt either. In my opinion more screen time is better than doing something you resent because you are enjoying it and you are also technically socializing by messaging¬†or calls. All in all lots of screen time may not be healthy, but its better than participating in activity you dont like.

In conclusion it shouldn't be mandatory to be in an extracurricular activity because of the schedules of students and being forced to do something you dont want to do. Activities will interfere with these things causing chaos and even resenting school. This is my honest opinion on this decision. If you take the time to think about this decision, you'll realize whos going to be effected and how they are going to be effected. This is why I disagree about having to participate in extracurricular activities.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
27D3919AEAE2,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This seems rather odd to us to ask someone else rather than ourselves what choice to chose, but asking some one else for advice is actually very important and effective. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because some people are wise, you have many different opinions from other people to choose from, and you might not like the choice you thought of.

To begin with, seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because some people are wise. They may have been in a same or similar situation you may be in, they learned what they saw and is telling it to others along the way, they have greater wisdom about the world, having strong and thoughtful advice as well as being trustworthy people who would not try to steer others in the wrong direction, and they can pull or convince you to go into the right way to being a better person, in fact, some books and movies actually teach this lesson to the audience so they can learn it. All in all, you should get advice from people who are wise and are not on the bad side of life.

Next, you have many different opinions from other people to choose from. People from all the countries in the world see one thing or action different from how another person thinks, some have good outcomes while others have unhelpful outcomes, others might not understand what you are telling them so they might guess and give the wrong answer to you, singling out some of the advice given will make the chances of having a good outcome even greater, and people who known what their talking about, are often correct and suggest better pickings. To sum up, it is very good to have multiple opinions from others to see if one of their advice is better than the other.

Finally, you might not like the choice you thought of. It could end in an unpleasant outcome with bad consequences, your opinion could make you fall in with the wrong crowd of people, there is a high chance that stress will come to anyone who struggle with coming up with something to do, this may also cause you to have little confidence when you can not come up with advice for yourself, even though, it is okay to not know something and it is also fine to ask or talk to someone who dose know it, and do not try to come up with advice to something you can not do or know very little about. To warp it all up, if you come up with advice that dose not sound very wise, please ask another person so they can teach you the right way so you can be safe.

In conclusion, s eeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because some people are wise, you have many different opinions from other people to choose from, and you might not like the choice you thought of. You should care about this because many young kids and adults often do not ask others for advice because they do not know any better or refuse to ask another person they do not known to ask them for advice to do or not to do something, end up doing it that might get them in trouble or even get hurt. So that is why advice giving by people is so important because it steers those into the right path and get them up on their feet. So if you plan to hear or give advice to another person, tell them something wise a easy to understand so they could possibly pass it on to others. If you do this, then you will feel very confident in yourself and give advice where ever you go. If you do not do this, then you will not know what is right or wrong from another persons advice and you will likely not live a great life where you give advice but instead deny advice.",0,persuade_corpus,,0

A2EA2D3D0542,"Working in groups has a range of benefits compared to working alone. Collaborative efforts have the advantage of combining a variety of perspectives; when it comes to tackling an issue, two or more people working together can provide different perspectives than a single individual. This makes it easier to come up with creative solutions to problems. Additionally, group work has the potential to be more efficient than individual work, as dividing the workload amongst members can speed up the process. 

Communication is an important factor in group work. Having a common goal and communicating it through all group members ensures that everyone is on the same page, reducing conflict and misinterpretation. It is also essential to respect each other's opinions and points of view in order to create an effective atmosphere towards achieving the goal. Additionally, groups can provide helpful and constructive feedback to its members, which can help refine ideas and identify potential weaknesses. 

From my own experience, working in groups can be incredibly advantageous. Group work has enabled me to learn from the collective knowledge of my peers, and allowed me to develop my capacity for collaboration and communication. Furthermore, I was able to use group based activities to develop proficiency in problem solving and negotiation, essential skills in the real world. 

Ultimately, working in groups has many advantages compared to working alone. It is an efficient way of working and allows people to benefit from different perspectives.

AEE03367AC03,"Being able to attend a class from home is a poor idea created by schools for students that cant attend school.

Recently schools have created online classes for students who cant attend or when the school is closed. Although some say that a student being able to attend a class from home can benefit their mental stability or there transit.

Attending a class from home promotes being lazy, allows more distractions and can take the drive out of a student.

Some other reasons would be. Not having to attend classes makes the student lazy. The students no longer have to rush to class, or wake up early. Theyre almost encouraged to become more lenient with the work. Also the classes can be completed at any given time allowing severe procrastination to kick in. Taking these online classes you begin to lose the school social life by not actually attending. A key part of any school is the meeting of friends and peers along the way but staying home all the time, you obtain little to no social in school life. knowing your teachers can bring along relationships that can help you out later in life such as a recommendation for a job. Attending from home offers more distractions. some would argue that school is the more distracting place for a student but at home your own freedom can get the best of you and lead you away from your work without someone pulling you back in.

There is a variety of reason why. Being away can free a students mind even with the stress of school.

Allowing a student to be away from their regular home lifestyle can benefit their mood as well¬†as showing them something new in life to keep there mind creative. staying at home offers little life experiences that any kids deserves to experience. It takes away drive a student need to succeed . They no longer have to make a class a priority since they have all the time to complete it, and they begin to lose interest¬†in trying to make sure they are doing the best they can to succeed. Taking an online class just doesnt involve you and keep you in the loop like a regular class will. It could leave you almost less knowledgeable then actually attending. You only retain the information that the online videos or prompts give you, you dont get to here the extra knowledge you could learn in a more interactive environment.

Attending a class from home can leave you lazy, finding more distractions, and it can take the drive out of you.

ABD9950CF232,"What makes a mistake something someone will never do again? It is usually the outcome of the mistake. It is what went wrong, but the problem with texting and driving is that it is not always something that goes wrong, but when it does go astray, it is usually life-threatening. How are people supposed to learn from an outcome that has never happened to them? The first step of learning from a mistake is to own the mistake, but it is hard to own a mistake when it does not feel like one. Well, the easiest way is to learn from someone else's mistake.

Liz Marks was a popular girl, a model even, but that all stopped when she used her phone while driving. She read a one-word text before she even had time to respond; she had crashed into a truck. Liz had to be airlifted from the accident to the University of Baltimore Shock Trauma Center, and the first responders did not even think she would make it. She ended up spending a month in the ICU to have various surgeries. After that, she spent another three months at the Kennedy Krieger Institute relearning reading, writing, walking, talking, swallowing, and chewing. She survived, but she has severe facial trauma. She is blind in one eye, cannot smell, has lost some of her hearing, cannot even make her tears, and cannot sleep without medication.

Alexandra Mansonet was found guilty of vehicular manslaughter after she killed someone while texting and driving. The lawyer stated, ""It's going to be very difficult for her to deal with the fact that at sentencing she could be incarcerated for something we are all guilty of doing on a daily basis."" She was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Not only does she have to spend ten years in prison for something that almost everyone does, but she will forever have to live with the guilt of knowing her actions killed someone. She will always know that her texting back that she wanted Mexican food led to a woman dying. Alexandra was not a bad person.

She was the chief executive at a nonprofit and had won awards or her extensive work with troubled youth. She could be replaced by almost anyone in this situation. It only takes a little bit of bad luck and a decision that 240,900,000 people make a year to end someone's life.

How deadly is texting while driving? The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that in America alone, approximately 660,000 people try to use their phones while driving everyday. This averages 240,900,000 people a year, which is 5% more than the number of licensed people in America. According to the NHTSA, between 2014 and 2017, 1,366 people died from crashes involving drivers using cell phones. 1,300 people are enough to constitute a massacre, a massacre where the weapon used was the send button. A massacre composed of people saying what they want to eat, and when they are going to arrive, that is if they end up at their destination. A massacre made up of people just like any other people.

People who never thought it would happen to them.

Every time someone looks at their phone while driving, it's a gamble. One where the wager is their life versus something as trivial as what kind of music they want to listen to or what they want to eat for dinner. Unfortunately, some of them never make it there. It is a question people have to ask themselves: Would you rather lose a minute of your life or your life in a minute?   ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
8EEB5226121C,"Dear Mr. Rubio,

My name is PROPER_NAME and I am a concerned youth.

The electoral college system is archane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely over-looked in an election. For a country that was built on the ideals of freedom and fair representation, using the electoral college system isn't right.

Firstly, canidates running for president need a majority of 270 the 538 electors to win an election. Thus, they focus more on winning swing states such as Ohio, rather than winning the approval of their constituents. This immediatly shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's super-power? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote- a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, old-fashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections?

Secondly, the electoral college (in addition to putting down the voter) has been proven to be faulty. Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968- these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World- the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representitives- without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy?

The electoral college.

This system goes against every democratic ideal in the United States' foundation! And yet, it is still how president after preseident is put into the Oval Office- sometimes wrongly as explained above.

The electoral college is wrong. It just is. There are no valid arguements for it. It puts down the voter and, in a sense, makes them obsolete which, in addition to being extremely hypocritical, is just not right .

Mr. Rubio, I am a citizen of this great country. I don't break the law, I don't burn flags, I love my nation and I care deeply for my fellow Americans. You are a United States Senator. Shouldn't you feel the same way? Help to abolish the electoral college. There are only benefits for the corrupt, not for the citizens.

Mr. Rubio, help to abolish the electoral college if you believe in a strong America.

FB07AD956C87,"Every student has dreamed about the idea of attending classes at home. Unconditionally, this very thought has already been emphasized ever since the invention of homework. Now, with the advancement in computers and technology, homework can be transformed into classwork that students can do throughout the day from the bed they sleep on. Many benefits are offered to both students and teachers when using online videos and conferencing for students at home. Almost every student has online access, encouraging sick and injured students to still do work at home without missing class time. Though a few problems exist with attending class from home, the benefits ultimately outweigh the negatives.

With current day technology, students have access to the internet almost everywhere they go. With the introduction of

Google's Chromebook more than 5 years ago ,

students are able to use their schools laptop for completing online work at their house. This encourages the idea that students don't need to have a phone or a home computer in order to complete work online. Even with no internet at home, students have the ability to go to the library to get free public WiFi. Thanks to another Google based website;

Google Classroom is a website where teachers can create private online classes where they upload classwork and other useful information students can view via an invitation code to the class. With a site like

Google Classroom, students have an extremely high chance of doing online work without much hassle, such as needing hard copies of the missed classwork and lessons. Theoretically speaking, hundreds of millions of students around the world already do this. This enchances the idea of ""Online Classwork"" instead of just ""Online homework, which many of us are already familiar with.

Additionally, the incredible online accessiblity grants students who are sick, injured, or missed school because of snow days, the option to do work online. When students are sick or injured, they are highly advised to stay at home. This brings up the still occuring problem of missing assignments and lessons. By offering online lessons and assignments, these students are able to complete their classwork without being behind and having F's put in for assignments, even with an excused absence. Furthermore, if school is cancelled because of snow or even the spreading of the Coronavirus, teachers have the ability to assign online work to their students. Teachers also have the ability to post videos of the lessons, which may help the students in need. With that added benefit, both students and teachers have less work to worry about. This introduces the idea of saving time. With the addition of online lessons and classwork, students and teachers are being granted the ability to not miss a certain unit or lesson, limiting many students from falling behind on classwork and other assignments.

However, there are a few negatives that come to play when it comes to online conferencing and classwork. As many adults are aware of by now, laziness is common amongst many teens. Students who don't feel like completing their online work will instead: play video games, hang out with friends, or do non-educational activities. While this is completely up to the student, online assignments can be brushed off and seen as useless if given many opportunities to fix that mistake. Along with laziness, students are more capable of cheating by looking up answers or asking friends whether or not they have completed certain online assignments. This limits students from learning and not taking classwork seriously, which possibly limits their potential of passing future tests. If a student does not understand an assignment they are doing even if their teacher uploaded a video of a lesson, the student will need to schedule a time to have a video conference with their teacher. This can be a problem due to the teacher being unavailable until a certain time, or unvailable the whole day.

Even with the few added negatives of attending online classes from home, students are offered the ability to keep their grades up by doing school work online at home. Teachers can also save their time chasing down a student for missing assignments as long as the student is able to complete their work online. In conclusion, attending classes from home is a great idea for students in need, as they get the opportunity to complete their assignments without hassle, stay on top of class lessons, and save both their and their teachers time.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

People have taken advantage of this strategy by taking technology; such as laptops, tablets, and phones, to Cafes and Libraries, in order to access the internet to finish class projects and study for tests. This strategy has helped people dedicate their use of free time to more school related purposes. Students are able to video conference a teacher or another student to catch up on missed lessons.

On the other hand, many individuals frown upon the influx of online classes. The public believes that many people have used online and video conference classes as a slacking tool. Media tries to persuade the Public, not to apply for online classes and video conferences believing that they are a waste of time, proving that that they will not challenge you. Those people don't understand that slacking in an online class can affect your transcript, because your grade can constantly go down. Also, some schools require certain GPA's to take Standardized tests, in order to decide, if the student qualifies or not. In many cases, people rephrase from failing online and video courses, because the teachers or providers of the lessons tend to be a little harder on the student than normal teachers.

In Conclusion, more schools should offer the ability to sign up for online classes and video conferencing. The use of these new forms of teaching could help students acquire more focus towards education.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,4
BF72FB4B953F,"Graduating from high school in three years has become an increasingly popular option for many students. While some may see the benefits of graduating early, others may argue that the emotional, physical, and mental stress of graduating in three years may not be worth it. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of graduating from high school in three years, and argue that it is ultimately not worth the stress.

One of the main benefits of graduating in three years is that it allows students to get a head start on their future. By graduating early, students can begin their post-secondary education or enter the workforce sooner, which can lead to more opportunities and higher earning potential in the long run. Additionally, graduating early can be a sense of accomplishment and pride for students, as they have achieved a significant milestone in their lives.

However, there are also several drawbacks to graduating in three years. One of the main drawbacks is the emotional stress that comes with graduating high school. For many students, high school is a time of significant change and growth, and graduating early can be a difficult and emotional experience. Additionally, graduating early may mean that students are not fully prepared for the challenges that come with post-secondary education or the workforce. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy or a lack of confidence in their abilities.

Another drawback of graduating in three years is the physical stress that comes with it. High school is a time of significant physical development, and graduating early may mean that students are not fully developed physically. This can lead to health issues later in life, and may also impact their ability to participate in certain activities or sports.

Finally, graduating in three years may not be financially beneficial for students. While graduating early can lead to more opportunities and higher earning potential in the long run, it may also mean that students have to take on more debt to pay for their post-secondary education or living expenses. This can be a significant financial burden for students, and may not be worth the benefits of graduating early.

In conclusion, graduating from high school in three years has both benefits and drawbacks. While it may allow students to get a head start on their future, it also comes with significant emotional, physical, and mental stress. Ultimately, it is not worth the stress for most students.

5FF174EA44A8,"Dear Principle,

I think the cell phone policy 1 that states ''Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time'' is was you should consider the new policy. This policy is both fair to the students and the teachers. I feel as though why should i have to leave my phone at home, if i can just turn it off during class time. Policy 2 is not fair at all. Students should have some freedom with there cell phones. The biggest concern with the phones being brought to school is that the students will have he phones out in class, and will not being paying the teacher no attention. So they feel to eliminate the problems students should just keep them at home huh? But with policy 1 it makes it so much fair for the teachers and the students. It lets the students bring there phones to school and pay attention in class at the same time.

In the video it demonstrated a lot of students using there phones in the classroom as well as the hallways. I think that in the scene where the video showed the students in class having his\her phone out is where the problem begins. If you had a policy like policy 1 you wouldn't have to worry about it. I understand that the students need discipline also but giving them the policy to have to leave there phones at home is so not fair. Letting the students know that we are giving you the privilege to bring your cell phone to school but you MUST turn them off while your in class time, or teachers have the right to convenscate them. i feel that's fair because if the students follow the rules that the phones must be off they wont have to even worry about there phones getting taking. I don't understand the problem with allowing the students to have there phones out while there at lunch or having free time. For example say if we are having a school activity such as a dance or a basketball game. Everybody doesn't enjoy these types of games\activitys. So maybe they would prefer to just sit down and maybe play a game or something on there phone. Me personality i would rather be on my phone then watch a boring basketball game but that's my opinion.

With policy 2 there are not all problems or cons with that policy. I just think that the students should have a say to. Policy 2 can eliminate a lot of problems such as the following,

-Getting your phone stolen.

-Getting it taking from a teacher for having it out.

-Not pay attention while your in class because your on it.

All of these possible problems can and might would happen but, as policy 1 states as long as they are off during class time. I think by allowing the students to bring there phones to school gives us more FREEDOM & RESPONSIBILLITY! The reason i think that is because if we could bring our phones to school knowing that if we have them out when were not suppose to then we will have consequences to face. So if we have the responsibility to bring them then we wouldn't do anything wrong. Also this is giving us more freedom",0,persuade_corpus,,2
CEAD27DE3263,"We tend to accomplish more if we always do something. In my opinion, I think that if people want to accomplish more, then they would do more to make their lives better. For example, a teen who gets eight hours of sleep before school wont be tired then a teen who slept for three hours. The teen who slept more will accomplish a successful school year because he slept earlier. Responsibility is a big role of being able to accomplish something; unfortunately, not everyone's responsible.

There are many ways someone can accomplish something, but they all start out with them taking action. as an example I'm going to use Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Both of these men started out with nothing. no one knew who these two men were 13 years ago. But that all changed when both of them announce their new technology. If it weren't for them, no one would have these useful items: IPhone, Android, Xbox, Window computers, etc. However, the reason they accomplished all that, was because they both studied and worked hard.

Inactivity can also serve a purpose in a person in my opinion. I think that people who do not want to accomplish something is because they do not want to push themselves into doing so. Another reason I think that they're not pushing themselves is because they don't have anyone to support them or help them out. Those are two main reason why I think people are inactive.

In conclusion, we do accomplish more if we are always doing something. you cannot simply do nothing and wait for it to be accomplished by itself. everything thing you do now will lead to a bigger accomplismnet. If you want to be sucessful, you always have to do something, Even though it's little things like helping your parents cook, or washing the dishes.",0,original_moth,"Task:

Were on the job! People are actually doing something about this crisis. Car pollution is increasing because more people are buying cars. So that means people need to stop driving and find a new transportation like bikes.''Almost 4,000 drivers were fined,according to Reuters''.It's about time people start caring for this world.

many places in the world are starting to ban cars places like paris,colombia, and germany. in some places its be couse of the cost in vauban, germany it cost up to 40,000 for a car space and a house so many people just have a house not a carman y peolpe like it like this they say it takes stress away. this also helps with gas¬† emissons in europe. in europe up to 12 percent of gas emissions¬† are resposeable by cars and up to 50 in gas emissons.

many peole also like this becuase it makes the stores closer to the poeple since not many people have cars they cant travle far so stores start setting up close and nearby. this also makes more space fore sidewalks and houses insted of stores. this aslo helps with your health beause it incuages iyou to wal kmor insted of taking a car every where.

in places like paris car have really effected the population there are so many peolple that it creates smog so what the peole did was they gave fines out to people that were driving on days they couldnt this brought 4,000 drivers to get fines 31$ and 27 to get ther car impounded. by stoping and lowering the amount of drivers they brouht congestion down by 60 percent and made the smog subside in bogota colombia they have got three straight years without cars there goal was to promote other means of transpotation. by doing this peole have made up to 118 miles of bike pathe and many parks for the public.

DE1A1149D54B,"I agree with that because positive attitude always bring the success in our life. It helps us with alots of things in our life. All people love those who have positive mentality and a good personality. In order to be successful in life u need to be respectful with every single things that we do everyday. We can get so much benifit out of it. It helps people to get more friends and make a good community. It also make our family think that we are smart and make them feel proud of us.

The first thing we all should do is to love our self if we cannot do that it will be hard for us to control our positive attitude. if we don't love our self we can't love others as well as you do to ourself. We are human we cannot be same as others in some point we make mistakes in life we always should try to move forward. Some of us might have have seen some people they can't be satisfy with their life beacause of their behavior and the way how they think of there life. We need to conduct our self in a perticular way to bring the power of success.

There are many people who can't show their love to people or who are kind of broke on their life most of them have negative mentality. Its not their fault maybe the situation makes them to be like that some of us living with depression and it causes a massive differents into our brain our thinking area and more other part or side effects. It also happened to me when i was freshmen during the highschool year. I started to giving up on my life i didn't feel like to doing anything in life. Every single day was the hell of my life. i broke down myself and put my self somewhere where no one can find me. I didn't talk to anybody just trying to stay at home all the times and realised how could i get out of this kind of situation. I was starting to loose friends in that time. Only those will understand if they ever gone through depression.

That was the worst feelings i ever felt in my life. i was trying so hard to figure out why this is happening to me and where does this come from and didn't get any response out of this. I felt negative every time. I tried so hard to change the situation but it didn't work. I didn't have anyone to share my feelings all i did is just to kept that in my heart and made my self cry alot. I throught of myself i will never be successful in life.

After few days passed one of my friend came to my house just to visit our family member and me. when i see him i was little happy to see him after a long time. i took him into my room and we were talking about somethings and recently he came up with a topic which is call depression. He knew how i was feeling with my life so he started to giving me some lesson to make me feel better and everything. First he told me i need to changed the way how i think about my self and people and he also told me there are many people who always try to push others down and make them feel bad and make you think something that is not good for you. My friends told me to ignore those and listen to my own heart. No matter, how u feel, always love your self and change the way how you think of youself. As a human no body is happy about their life in some point their sad but the main thing is we got to move onto forward. Forget about everythings that happened in the past.

After he have told me all the lesson i was feeling way better than the past i realised how crazy i was before and the way of my thinking. My friend he was so motivated. Whatever he told me it was so appriciated to me and it forced me to changed my self to become a normal and to be a possitive person. I decited to not to keep my life stop because i dont want to be in the same situstion as before. I want to make my family friends and all of my relatives feel proud of me. Every one of us need to love their selves and if they think in a negative way to bring the success in their life, it will never work thats why we all should try to handle our mind in a positive way.

CB17AF6F1138,"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! üòÖ For this essay, I'm gonna talk about how making your own decisions versus seeking guidance from experts and authorities can have pros and cons.

First off, let's talk about making your own decisions. It's like, when you're in charge of choosing what to do, you can be like, totally in control of your life. You can make decisions that are best for you, and you don't have to listen to anyone else's opinions. It's like, you're the boss of you, and that's pretty cool. Plus, when you make your own decisions, you can learn from your mistakes, and it can help you grow as a person. Like, you can learn to think critically and make better choices in the future.

But, on the other hand, making your own decisions can also be kinda tricky. Sometimes, you might not know what's best for you, and you might end up making a decision that's not so good. Like, you might choose a college major that you're not really interested in, or you might pick a career path that's not gonna make you happy. And that can be like, super stressful and regretful.

Now, let's talk about seeking guidance from experts and authorities. It's like, when you ask people who know more than you do, they can give you advice and help you make better decisions. They can provide you with information and experience that you might not have, and it can save you from making mistakes. Like, if you're trying to choose a college major, and you're not sure what to do, you can ask a career counselor, and they can help you figure it out.

But, sometimes, seeking guidance can also be limiting. Like, if you're always relying on others to make decisions for you, you might not learn how to make good choices on your own. And if you're not careful, you might end up following someone else's path without thinking about what's best for you. That can be like, not so great, you know?

So, in conclusion, making your own decisions and seeking guidance from experts and authorities",1,llama2_chat,Task:  Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of making one's own decisions versus seeking guidance from experts and authorities.

4439A9E6FBDB,"Have you ever heard the term majority rules? It means if more than half rule on one side, then that side will win. Many organizations and committees use majority rules because it means they are taking advice from multiple people and not just one. Taking opinions from multiple people may help someone with making a better choice. I believe it could give options to the wisdom-seeker, it could make them confident about one choice that they could go with, and it would mean they would have multiple arguments for a side.

When someone takes an opinion from multiple people, they have more choices/pieces of wisdom. If a person is writing an article and needs advice on what to write, they go to one person and only get one piece of advice to help them with their article. If they go to multiple people, they have options to weigh and decide what they want to write on. One example of this is Congress. Before any bill passes, they all take a vote. Whichever side is more than half will win, which is majority rules coming back into play. Congress does this to see what others have to say about the topic, not just what one person has to say. This is one of the reasons why taking more than one opinion can help someone make wise choices.

Last summer, I played on a travel basketball team that went to Maryland every weekend and played in a tournament. I was the point guard on the team, which meant that I was the captain on the court. I was calling plays, running pep talks, and keeping my teams head up. One Saturday, my dad and I drove up to the tournament and when I got there, all my teammates were excited. They started telling me about how easy our schedule was and how we could easily win this tournament. Our first game came and on the first play of the game, I twist my ankle. I sat the rest of the game out and my 2nd game as well. I told my dad that I would be fine to play in the championship but he told me that I couldn't. I asked my coach and he told me that I should not¬†take the risk. I was mad that my coach and my dad said I shouldn't play, but we still ending up winning. The moral of the story was that I took my dad's and my coach's advice and decided not to play. Since I got the advice from 2 trusted adults that I knew, I understood that it was probably the smartest decision for me to make. Taking advice from multiple people can make someone more confident about their choice on the topic.

Getting multiple opinions on a topic such as a debate article may not always mean he/she is right, but it means that they have multiple people's arguments on the topic. For example, if I asked around about child soldiers and I had multiple people tell me that they shouldn't be given amnesty, I could use their arguments to my side even if they should be given amnesty. If someone takes advice from different people and they all tell you along the same lines of the same piece of advice, they could use it even if it's wrong, because they have people standing behind them with the same argument and same reasons.

Taking advice from multiple people is more helpful than taking it from 1 person because it helps give options to someone who might need it for a test or a scenario in their life. It is also helpful when someone knows the advice they need but they want to check with others to see if they're thinking the same way about the scenario. The last reason of why it is important is because even if someone takes advice from many others and the advice is wrong, he/she has their arguments to help you out. This information is very important at the moment because right now the world is tasked with something they could use a lot of advice on. The Coronavirus is a disease that has 115,000 cases all around the world and the U.S. has 574 cases. The world has not found a cure yet and I believe that scientists are trying to find the cure themselves so they can get all the credit. If all the scientists in the world worked together and used each others advice and equipment, we could find a cure very easily and quickly. This is an example of using multiple people's advice because there could be 2 scientists who are very close to finding the cure and if they work together they could easily find the cure.   ¬† ¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3

B70499950AB4,"In the passage ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author believes that studying Venus is very viable despite how dangerous the planet is. The author, however shows many reasons to support this belief.

The main reason why it is so difficult for us to explore Venus now is that the planet has an atmosphere made up of sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide, meaning that for humans and machines alike this planet is uninhabitable. There is also the fact that Venus is the hottest recorded planet, and that mere metals would turn to liquid being on there. Even with these challenges, astronomers still believe they need to explore Venus, as it's structure is very similar to Earth; meaning that it may have been able to produce life at some point. Although the odds seemed stacked against us, many scientists have been trying and testing out theories for years, such as with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, believes that they could send astronauts near Venus in a blimp-like vehicle, avoiding the immense heat and radiation that awaits on it's surface. Even with this theory, it does not fully help our curiosity of the planet, as with staying above means there is no way to collect samples of gas, rocks, or virtually anything. Other people at NASA have also theorized and worked on other approaches to studing Venus. They believe that simplified, silicon carbide reinforced electronics could help emmensely, as the metal can stay intact in Venus' harsh conditions for over three weeks.

Even with all the dangers of Venus being known, researchers are working on innovations that will help us learn more about our neighboring planet. The author states that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" And with all of the facts he presents, he is very certain of this claim.            ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

562CE0C58932,"These sources focus on the advantages of limiting car usage. The usage of cars has been decreasing as the years go by, not only in the United States, but in other countries as well. The residents of certain countries are beginning to use walking or taking a train or a city bus as a means of transportation instead of using their cars, that is if they own one.

The advantages of limiting car usage are endless. One advantage is that it relieves a big amount of stress on people. According to source one, having a car is a big responsibility, sometimes one that certain people are not able to handle. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Not having a car or avoiding having to use a car is becoming easier for people. For people that live in suburban areas, public transportation is going to have a higher demand. This is because there is an attempt to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are going to be placed a walk away, or on a main street, rather than having them all together in malls along a distant highway. Not only will it make it easier for people to access stores or other necessities, but the money that the public transportation will receive will go to the city, giving them more to use on important things the community needs. Furthermore, it is evident that limiting car usage relieves a big amount of stress on people.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it brings people and countries together for a cause. Limiting the use of cars is spreading worldwide and there are many people that agree with this concept. According to the third source, in Bogota, Colombia, a program has been started that is set to lower the rate of care usage and increase the usage of public transprortation. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city empty and unoccupied. The interactions between the community are inevitable with so much people walking and being all in one place at one time. Furthermore, the act of a car-free day is also spreading to other countries. Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were extremely enthusiastic. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. With this act spreading and moving across borders into other countries, the use of cars will soon begin to decrease even more than it already has. This will help to lower the pollution as well as other economic problems caused by cars.

These sources focus on the advantages of limiting car usage. The usage of cars has been decreasing as the years go by, not only in the United States, but in other countries as well. The residents of certain countries are beginning to use walking or taking a train or a city bus as a means of transportation instead of using their cars, that is if they own one. With the information provided, how can one refuse to join the movement to limit car usage?       ¬†¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
05FFBFA9B3BA,"Dear principal,

I believe we should be able to have phones out in free time or lunch because if we need to call our parents or something to tell them something has been canceled. I don't that we should be able to have our phones in class because then it could make us so we are not as focused as we should be. I think we should also be able to have our phones during a free period for if someone is sick and then we can tell them what their assignment is or we can ask if they want us to get it for them.

I do like the idea of the first policy but if they abuse the rules by having their phones out during class then there should be a punishment for that. But we should be able to have it out during lunch when we are just sitting their with nothing to do. I think after lunch we should have to put them away in our lockers or give them to the office to hold on to for until we are going to leave. Why should we not be able to talk on our phones just to pass time when we get permission from one of the teachers when we get to have a party or something like that.

So I will have to go with policy number one. Then students wont try to hide talking on the phone or texting during class. Then the students will listen more in class. But we should always ask if we can have our phones out inste",0,persuade_corpus,,7
C4579416ABE5,"Over 10 million students signed up to take online classes at home last year. Sense the addition of online classes, the average IQ for high school¬†students has decreased copiously. Taking online classes at home is the main cause for this, and this way of learning is turning the youth from ambitious, smart students to lazy, dumb kids. Furthermore, online classes do not help students as some people thought they would and there is a very good reason why. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes at home because students will decrease their social skills, students will receive negative health effects, and students will complete less work.

First off, students will decrease their social skills as a result from taking classes at home. Everyday at public schools¬†students come in the building, and they instantly start chatting with their friends for almost the whole day. As a result, public school is a great way to make friends as there is always an opportunity to meet new people whether¬†it is at lunch, for group project, or even in gym class. On the other hand, if someone were to take classes at home, the students would be stuck in their room for 6 hours not talking to anyone face to face. If someone were to sit in there room for the whole day for everyday of the school year, the person would start to get very lonely. Because of this, the student's social skills will suffer, and the student will soon become an isolationist. To finish off, online schools do not benefit students because it makes students less social.

Secondly, students will not benefit from being able to take classes at home because the students will receive negative health effects. As research¬†states, the average person should only get two hours of screen time a day. If someone is taking online school at home, they will be staring into a screen for about six hours a day, which is 3 times the recommended amount. Furthermore, the results of siting in front¬†of the screen can lead to visual problems, an increase risk of arthritis, and it will destroy your posture from slouching at a computer all day. A man named Generic_Name was always on his computer for at least 6 hours a day. The constant strain on his eyes gave him weekly migraines and he almost lost vision in one eye. On the other hand, when someone is taking online classes, gym is not always offered; Students will miss out on their daily exercise needed to maintain good health. To wrap it up, if you want to have good health, do not take classes at home.

Finally, students will complete less work if they take classes at home. For a student who attends public school, all students run on a strict schedule with late bells and teachers that enforces the rules, but at home no one is stopping someone from doing their work 3 hours later from when it is supposed to be due. Most students are procrastinators and will not be motivated to do their work. At that age their brain is not fully developed, so teenagers and below are not as responsible as a teacher who will tell students when to do their work. Also, at this day and age many of teenagers are glued to their phones, which will decrease work productivity. Many scientists have proven that distractions can almost double someones time to complete a task. In contrast, teachers have strict phone rules to limit distraction in the classroom. To summarize that up, students will not benefit from being able to take classes at home because they will get less work done.

In conclusion, online classes do not help students as some people thought they would and there is a very good reason why. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes at home because students will decrease their social skills, students will receive negative health effects, and students will complete less work. If someone wants to accelerate among their peers, the student should just take classes at public schools because they provide better, well rounded¬†amount of education. To end it off, if someone wants to take online classwes at home, simply just tell them to stay in public school before¬†they end up as a nonathletic, unintelligent delinquent.¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,6

This is exactly what they are getting with the attempts at exploring Venus. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents; however, they do not adequately give reasons as to why the exporation of Venus is viable. The author fails to give reasoning as to how studying Venus benefits humanity, how research is progressing, or why Venus is a better choice than other planets.

The author of this article does not give adequate reasoning as to why studying this planet is prouctive for humanity. Throughout the article, the author claims that scientists want to study the planet because it is most like Earth density wise. While it is most like Earth's density, it is not like Earth in so many ways. Venus is a lot more dangerous and deadly when compared to Earth. It has thick, poisonus gas clouds. It also has a bailing surface. While in the past it was much like Earth, currently is is much different. The similarities between Venus and Earth are very few, and that makes Venus less desirable to study. The author also does not give examples of how examining the rocks, liquids, or metals could progress humanity.

The author does not contribute any major discoveries for the Venus projects. There are several examples in the article where the author states a new idea that scientists have for getting to Venus. However, most of these ideas are not solid enough. There has not been enough of a technological breakthrough for NASA to fund another trip to Venus. The text states, ""...not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This reinstates the point that, while there have been ideas, none of them are solid enough for a trip to Venus. If no signifigant progress has been made in 3 decades, why should NASA continue to fund the project?

The article does not make a claim as to why Venus is a better choice than any other planet. In the second paragraph, the author states numorous challenges to exploring Venus, but he does not list the disadvantages to studying a planet like Mars. According to the article, both of the planets are fairly close to Earth. At some points, Mars is even closer than Venus. This would make it easier to travel to Mars. It also does not appear as if Mars has even close to the same difficulties that Venus has, making it a safer option. It would also mean that Mars has a higher chance at colonization.

While this article provides many examples on why we should study Venus despite it's challenges, it does not do so in an adequate way. There are many glaring problems and reasonings that are just not addressed in this article. The author does not back up why the planet is so important, it's worth to humanity, or the scientific breakthoughs that warrent the project continuing. Due to those reasons, the author does not thouroughly support their idea that Venus is worthy. ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

4472129F46CF,"I think that asking for a B grade average is a little much to be able to play sports. C is called an average grade for a reason. B is above the average person.

Not everyone that plays sports has an above the average mind.

Most athletes can handle this but there are still some on the team that can't. Sometimes they have trouble maintaining a C average. Now where asking them to completely step up their whole report card? All this is doing is asking for trouble.

If we follow through with this, all they're doing is flunking more players off the sports team that they're on. This will lead to not having enough people to have a complete team. Not having enough people on a team can lead to many things. Examples are the couple that play will not get a break therefore they will be worn out and become exhaustingly tired. Then they will have trouble with the grades because they're so tired. Another is that they just won't even have the team anymore. This would make many students and parents sad and probably a little angry.

Now what we're trying to teach by doing this to the average people is to cram more. They will be so worried about a subject in school that they might forget another test that they have. This is going to distract them in their sport too. They will be so worried about making the grades so they can play that they won't be focused on the sport. Then they will start to fall behind. Then the coach will start to get mad at them for not being focused. If they start in their sport they could lose their spot because they can't focus on their sport.

D6068FF1B29A,"In my opinion yes and no, I am agree and desagree that¬†the sudents would benefit a lot if they take classes from home. There are student that likes to do what is better for another ones not.

There are so many reasons why.

RESPONSABILITIE

WEATHER

PRESSION

SOCIAL MEDIA

ACCESS TO INTERNET

Othe thing it should be more easy to take being able to attend classes from home than being in school. The responsabilitie of attend should be more but more confortable becuase is in home. The attandence from the ones than does not like to came to school will increase or from the ones that loves to skip just because they do not like to being in school.

One of the main reasons is the weather, sometimes is because of snow, rain and there is too cold schools are closed. There is so dangerous to the busses, to the ones who drive or who walk too. The streets are so smooth. So the students who walk can hit them selves if the slide. When it is raining the streets does not look very well and is almost the same with the snow, the cars get slide.

Taking classes in home online or by conference should be more easy than came to school. The students just take the classes in bed just waking up with a alarm. Attend should be good responsabilitie in a very good way. Maybe doing homework should be good too. If they put a penalty when the students not connect would be a good idea. Like when they put the detention when they do not came to school. It would be almost the same thing but more confortable because is in home. The parents would not be that worry if the kids are in school or not. Maybe they will have more to do things. Getting all the staff online should do a really big difference. They should be able to attend all the time with out worry if they get late or miss the bus.

There are things that does not benefit to the students, becuase if everyone is agree with that what is going to happen to the ones that does not have access to internet in home. That is not going to be for benefit for others. Not all of us have access to internet and they prefer to go to school because of that. I do not think that schools is going to provide internet just to take classes from home.

Other Unbenefit thing can be if the ones who are giving the conferences do not explain good everything and we have questions and the time is short, we are not going to understand everything and when the quizes came we are going to fail. The classes are not the same as schools, we provide the teachers like after school seccions with them so they can explain us what we did not understand.

Other thing about it is if the students are doing bad, the online session is not going to notify. In school we provide the services of the counselor,¬†after school sessions or tutoring. The students are not going to have all of that in home. It can be a good responsabilitie to take in home but there are student that are so lazy to take classes they prefered to do another things than taking classes, there is a lot of technoligy that there is ruinig so many of the teens. A lot of social media that we prefer to being looking and checking all that staff than taking the classes. In school the teachers, securities are there to say what is good and what not. In home they are going to do what they want.

I think the last 2 grades of schools should take the classes from home, because they already know what they want to do. The teachers from schools should take more attention to the others grades to get them ready from when they are going to take the ones online.

The teachers from schools can talk about it in the conferences that they have to assign online classes to the students who they think is going to handle it and is going to have the responsabilitie to take it. I know that the ones that are sick or have other thing can take online classes and it is benefit to them.

We soon saw that the advancements of technology had a profound impact on the way we communicate.

One of the positives of technology is that it has allowed us to connect with people who we would not have been able to do without it.

However, there can be potential negative implications, such as limiting real-life interactions and creating a false sense of connection or isolation.

776FBF88E6FF,"Online Learning: A Balanced Approach

As an 8th grader, I have been exposed to both in-person and online learning, and I believe that a balanced approach is the key to a successful education. While some countries and schools have embraced online learning, others have strict restrictions in place. In this essay, I will explore the consequences students face when online learning is not an option, the technological capabilities of countries that prohibit online learning, and the benefits and disadvantages of both in-person and online learning.

Countries that do not allow online learning often face consequences such as a lack of access to quality education, particularly in rural or remote areas. Without online learning, these students may not have the opportunity to learn from experienced teachers or access a wide range of educational resources. Additionally, these students may struggle to keep up with their peers in other countries who have access to online learning.

On the other hand, countries that have embraced online learning have seen significant benefits, including increased accessibility and flexibility. Online learning allows students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be particularly helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas. Online learning also provides students with access to a wide range of educational resources and experiences that may not be available in their local schools.

In terms of technological capabilities, countries that prohibit online learning may struggle to keep up with the rapidly advancing world of technology. Without access to online learning, these countries may fall behind in terms of technological advancements and may struggle to prepare their students for the modern workforce.

While both in-person and online learning have their benefits and disadvantages, I believe that a balanced approach is the key to a successful education. In-person learning provides students with the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers face-to-face, which can lead to a more engaging and personalized learning experience. However, in-person learning can also be limited by the availability of resources and the ability of teachers to provide individualized attention to each student.

69144038DA0E,"Dear Principal,

I think it would be a good idea to let students bring their phones to school but only let them use their cell phones at lunch and other free periods. This is a good idea for many reasons including they can check with parents about the rest of the day, they can write down in their phones what assignments they have and notes about it.

If students where allowed to have cell phones in school they would be able to check with their parents about their after school schedule. For example say the student has a younger sibling they need to pick up but their parent forgot to tell them then if the student had a phone they could learn about the task and know they had to do it. That is just one reason why it is a good idea for students to be allowed to have cell phones in school.

Also if a student forgets thing easily they can write down a assignment on their phones to remember it after school. This can help raise students grades and therefore giving the student more self esteem and more chances to succeed in life. Would you deny a student their future?

Some people might say that students would use their phones in class and that would distract them from learning. But this is a simple problem to fix. you could make a rule saying that if anyone is caught using their phones in class that they get a detention. and if a teacher can spot someone chewing gum then they can spot someone on a phone.

So as you can see letting students have phones during school but only letting them use it during free periods is a great idea. It is a great idea because parents could inform student about their after school schedule and students could write down assignments after class on their phones. And if this turns out to be a bad idea you could always take away the rule.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

I know that we aren't actually voting for the president our electors of our states do that. They may consider our votes but in the end they decide who our state chooses for president. The canidates have to have a majority of 270 electoral votes to win the right to be president. In reality, the people should be the ones to vote for the president not the Electoral College. We should be able to decide who we want to be the president of the United States to be.

""The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president.""(source 1 paragraph 2, the office of the federal register). See we don't actually chose our president even though we should be able too. We are the people of the United States and it's a free country, we shouldn't rely on the electors for our state to chose who the president will be. We shouldn't have to worry if the Electoral College will chose the right person for our country. We should be able to make the right decision and not rely on other people to make the choice for us.

Abolishing the Electoral College is a good thing because we Americans dont deserve to come second. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.""(source 2¬† paragraph 10, Bradford Plumer).The electoral college could make a mistake and choose the wrong person to be our president but we Americans know whats 's best for our country, but sometimes we don't always get what we want. We don't decide who the president and that is wrong, but sometimes we have to deal with things we don't like.

Many people will argue with my decision of abolishing the Electoral College. ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a tran-regional appeal.""( source 3 paragraph 19, Richard A. Posner). Apparently the Electoral College restores weight back in to the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment.

Yes there may be very¬† good arguements about keeping the Electoral College but we should be able to vote for our president. We should have someone we dont even know vote for our president, we love our country and we want what's best for it. What is best for our country is allowing the people vote for the president not the Electoral College.       ¬†¬†¬†       ¬†¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

School is not only a place to learn, but making relationship¬†with other people and learn have to communicated. Some people may believe that friendships can be unhealthy, cause bully, and depression to students. In the other hand, students such not isolated their selves from people, having a friend can make a big different in a students life, and learn how to communicated with one an others.

School have many clubs that student have created to help others. In my school, there are many clubs that help with collecting food, clothes, or supplies to give to the people that need it. Other clubs show new ways to make a better community and help the environment. Me, like a student participated in this activities is something very wonderful. This is a privilege of attend school with others student, we get to come out with ideas to make this world a better place to live. Some may disagree in this ideas, but have a places such like a clubs to get together, and shared opinions about how to make our life more activate in this world. Therefore, student are the future and getting to know each other it can make a different in society.

Get to go to school flip trips and explored new experiences. Almost every school had made a trip for students to have fun and learning something new. It could be a trip to a museum, a park, or historic places. In my life experience, this trips can be very fun. It's better being visiting a place than reading a textbook that related on the topic. Being home school may not give student to participated in this activities with other students. They probably have more time to get out and got to trips. Would this be fun for those student without having the opportunity¬†to spend time with other students, and make a memory that may stay for rest of their life. People would argued about this, but being studying with other students is way to built unforgettable memories. In other words, go in flip trip with other students and spend time together can make student life more happy.

In conclusion, one point in life we look back for those unforgettable memories, and we smile at the special moment, we had. Taking classes from home can be benefit for some students. In my opinion, I disagree in this position because student need to built up friendships, participated clubs, and go out in school flip trips. Spending time with one an others can help student to be better to communicated with others and be more confident to themselves. It get student to be ready to see the world at head of them.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3
A7A467BDEE14,"America: land of the free, the brave, and millions of proud citizens who live in a country that prides itself on its preservation of human rights and everything else that makes up a proper society. However, in order to remain a fair republic that truly takes into account the opinions of all citizens, we must make one major change. The flawed Electoral College must be abolished and replaced with election by popular vote in order to ensure the well being of our country.

Proponents of the Electoral College would gasp in horror at this suggestion, arguing that their systematic method is virtually foolproof. Nevertheless, with a voting method as complicated as the Electoral College, the room for error is far too great. Just look at what happened in 1960, when racist legislators tried to replace the democtratic electors¬† chosen by popular vote in order to sabotage John F. Kennedy's chances. Then yet another electoral disaster occured in 2000. Both of these events could very easily happen again and the consequences of such mistakes are unfathomable. History has been proven to repeat itself, and this is no exeption. Who's to say that electors won't just ignore the wishes of voters or that legislators won't manipulate the system? When it comes to choosing our leade, whose actions will ultimately decide whether or not America will continue to survive and thrive, it would be a huge mistake to leave this resposibility to one group of individuals. After all, nobody is perfect.

Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. Just consider the fact that by completely ignoring all of the other states, campaigners are ignoring millions of individuals who deserve to have a say in who will be in charge. Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true. In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the 'thoughtful' voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves.

The problems with the Electoral College only go on. If a tie were to occur, the election would be determined by members of the House of Representatives, who do an even poorer job of representing the people considering each state casts only one vote. Also, due to the fact that the Electoral College mainly operates with the winner-take-all rule, it is easy for individuals in Democratic or Republican states to feel as if their vote doesn't matter.

It is also important to note that at the end of the day, election by popular vote accomplishes the goal of reflecting the opinion of the public far better than election by Electoral College. The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.

For all of these reasons, I urge you to change the system to election by popular vote. It is without a doubt the only way this country can continue to be the great nation that it is for centuries to come.       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
B516D974076B,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it tells the reader about the challenges that there are for exploring Venus. It also talks about reasons why reseachers and scientist should not give up on the exploration of Venus. In the passage, the author supports his idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining how the trip could be made safer, the technology that can be used, and the value of exploring the planet.

The author supports the idea that Venus is worth exploring by explaining and giving examples on how travelling to Venus could be made safer. In the article, it says ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" In other words, this proves how the trip to explore Venus can be made more safer. Furthermore, the author supports his idea by giving examples and explaining how the exploration of Venus can be safe.

Another way the author supports his idea is by explaining the techonlogy that can be used to explore Venus. In paragraph 7 of the article, it states ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This shows how this type of technology can be used for the further exploration of Venus.

Lastly, another way that the author supports his idea is by explaining what the value would be if humans explore Venus. In the last paragraph of the article, it says ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" It also states ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This proves what the value of exploring Venus would be for humans. In other words, the author supports his idea by explaining the opportunities and values of exploring Venus.

Furthermore, the author supports his idea that Venus is a worthly pursuit despite the dangers by explaining the travel safety, the technology that can be used, and the value of exploring Venus. The technology that humans have right now can bring so many opportunities, such as exploring new planets. These opportunities should be used now and not be on hold. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
E1396D3FA930,"I dont think the a computer reading emotins would be valuable in a classroom because technology is not always acurrate. We use a lot of different facial muscles when just making one facial expression. Student dont really show emotion when the class their in is boring.

One reason i dont think its valuable because emotions can change at any moment .Saying someone is 80% happy in a pictuer wouldnt always be ture becuase they could be smiling but also could be more sad than they are happy. Some people have a bipolar disoder which makes their eomtion change very fast , and some people are just very temperamental. Some students show emotions differnt than others . For example one student that is very upset could be yelling and shouting about it and another student that as angery as the other student could be very calm about it and not showing that they are angery.

Another reason i dont think its acurrate is because sometimes we dont just use one muscle to make a facial expresion. The computer only test one facial muscle to an emotion. Paragraph three states"" For example , your frontails pars laterlis muscle raises your eyebrows when your surprised ..."" but also when someone is surprised they sometimes move their mouth muscles. We move our mouth muscles for almost every emotion.

I dont think it would be a good idea to put one of these computers in a classroom becuase each student shows emotion different and some students might not shoe emotion at all , therefore the computer would be getting emotion from about half the claaroom which wouldnt be acurrate .",0,persuade_corpus,,2
BEFA85A6134B,"Have you ever come across of asking people for an advice if so great. Asking people for an advice is a good way to see what is good and bad. Why cause if you do something stupid your going to regret it. The good part is that it's gonna be for something that your gonna get better at. If so lets say your having a hard time baking a cake and you ask for someones help. The person you ask for help might say "" Don't bake that cake for to long and use less eggs"". So in that case you learn from the mistake and now you know how to bake a cake.

First of all it's great for asking an advice cause you can ether learn from it. When something wrong your friends are there to tell you what to do or what no to do.

I think that you should let the students bring there cell phones to school and let them use it during free and at lunch. So you should use policy1 cause if you don't then their going to bring them so many times. It would be better like that. Because everyone will love using their phones with out having to sneak it even at lunch or in the morning.

You really should do that but don't get angry if they forget to turn off their cell phones cause a lot of kids always forgets i do. And so does my friends. Also i would use policy 2 cause no one would for get to turn off their cell phones. But they would be making explanation to have their phones .

So i would pick policy 1 but if their using it in class then i would take policy 2 to teach them a lesson. I wouldn't care if they got mad serve them right. So remember always be fair especially if it's about phones everyone again I'm going to say everyone loves their phones. I would take in to consideration that you would select policy 1

Please pick policy 1 cause kids won't have to sneak phones to lunch in the morning or in class you would be doing all of us a favor. Also maybe they would pay more attention in class just maybe. It would be good for the school, for the district and for the students.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
C5A3278EB458,"Should there be a rule on everyone taking extracurricular¬†activities. Yes because they provide information and fun for the students. Without after school activities students wouldn't of made as many friends as they have made. When I was in an extracurricular class we got to know the teacher better and see what she had to teach us. I met one of my friends today at an extracurricular activity because¬†we had the same interest in soccer. I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricular¬†activity so they can meet new students, be active, and learn more about a subject.

Extracurricular activities educate students about a specific topic that the students are interested in. For example, I was in the soccer club in 6th grade and we learned about the history of the sport and how it started. The robotics club is where students learn about building and technology. It can help students learn tips and tricks about architecture and how to build things. That can help them in the long run if they want to join a field that uses robotic and architecture. It also teaches students how to work with others to solve a problem. Extracurricular activities serve as good learning chances for students.

By taking extracurricular classes students get to meet new students and make friends. The students have common interest so they can talk to others and make friends. An extracurricular activity would be good for a shy student so they can get out of their comfort zone in a small group of people. Students can learn to share their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a small group and them they can get more comfortable to do it normal school. These friends can transfer over to normal school so kids that are quiet and don't have any friends will have someone to talk to, someone to work with during group work and, a friend. Extracurricular activities can help students make friends and come out of their comfort zone.

Being active is an important part of daily life. Extracurricular activities can help students be more active. They give students something to do after school other than homework and sports. Students can catch up with their friends they haven't seen all day and give their parents a break. Extracurricular activities are good for teachers if they are bored and want to teach and have fun with their students. Extracurricular activities also count as the sports teams so you can be active by joining a sports team. For example, I joined the soccer club so i could be active. It was really fun and a good way to be active. Extracurricular activities are a good way to be healthy and active.

Extracurricular activities gives lots of opportunities to students. They should make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities have lots to give to the students. They should be mandatory for them so they can learn more and expand their view of learning. Extracurricular activities helps kids come out of their comfort zone and make friends.

74B2B6CD2605,"""Mom,"" Generic_Name whimpered sadly. ""Why is it so hard to make friends in school?"" Her mother moves slowly towards the edge of her daughters bed and grabs her hand. ""Now sweetie,"" her mother says comfortingly. ""I'm sure if you tried hard enough you could make friends with someone."" Crying softly Generic_Name turns toward her mother and says angrily, ""It's not that easy mom! I don't have anything to talk about with these people. We don't even like the same things!"" sighing her mother pulls her in for a hug, ""oh honey, I'm so sorry. I had no idea."" Generic_Name's mother can't do anything but rock her sobbing child as she cries .

This is a sad reality for many kids, throughout all stages of schooling, they have difficulties making friends and often end up feeling isolated and lonely. This problem can be easily solved by school principals requiring students participate in at least one extracurricular activity like a club or a sport. These extracurricular activities would help encourage students to be more social with their peers, pursue a passion or hobby, and give each other¬†opportunities to learn more about themselves while expressing their personal interests and talents.

The first reason schools should make extracurricular activities a requirement is because they would encourage students to be more social with their peers. As a student with social anxiety I know how difficult it can be to try and talk to people and make friends, but in my experience i've noticed that clubs and sports give students more confidence in themselves. An extracurricular activity, whether it be a sport or a club, is an effective and easy way for a student to put them self¬†out there with people who share their interests. For example when I first started school it was hard for me to talk to people and I didn't have many friends, then one day my language arts teacher encouraged me to try out for our school track team. I was skeptical, but decided to give it a chance, and it ended up being one of the smartest decisions I had made that year. After making the team I steadily came more and more out of my shell with the motivation of my teammates. I built strong friendships with many of the girls on my team solely because of the interest that bonded us together, our love for running. Joining track made me more confident in myself, and taught me how to make and maintain unbreakable friendships.

My second piece of reasoning as to why schools should require extracurricular activities, is because they would urge students to try new things and become interested in different hobbies. During the years students are in school, their hobbies are constantly evolving at a rapid pace, and they often become interested in things they had never acknowledged before. This example is true to many people, including myself. After track season had ended I decided I wanted to join an after school¬†club, but none of the options really caught my eye. After searching for awhile a friend from the track team asked if I would be interested in joining our school robotics club as her teammate. As I had no other options that jumped out to me, I decided to try joining. Since joining the club in my sixth grade year I've developed a passion for engineering and computer programming that I never would have imagined developing otherwise. Taking that one chance to join the club has turned my previous skills and new ideas into a passion I doubt I'll ever lose.

The final reason that extracurricular¬†activities should be required is that being in a club or sport would assist students in discovering more about themselves. In many cases people find out new things about themselves while participating in a club. It could be simple things such as unknown talents, or as complicated as realizing their social position on a team. When I first joined robotics in my sixth grade year, I was what you would describe as a follower. But when our team captain was out because of a concussion and my team was falling apart, we found out that I was, as described by my coach, ""A natural born leader."" Even being the unsociable person I am, I was able to lead my team with no assistance for three weeks, with a strength I wasn't sure I had. After this discovery I was promoted by my coach to be a team captain. For the last three years I have been the captain of my team, and as this is my final year considering I'm an eighth grader, my coach decided to test my skills. The past four months I have been captain and supervisor of three different teams by his order. I realize as I look back I never would have learned this about myself without joining robotics club.

""MOM!"" Elise shouts excitedly as she rushes through the front door, ""WE WON!"" from her place in the kitchen her mother lets out a whoop of surprise before running to join her daughter in the living room. Surrounded by her teammates Elise holds the 1st place trophy up proudly as she laughs. The house is filled with the joyous laughter of Elise and her friends from the soccer club. As the girls chat between themselves Elise's mother looks on with a smile, proud of her daughter for finding friends that made her happy. Making eye contact with Elise she shouts, ""All right, Group picture!"" Lining up with large smiles on their faces and arms around¬†each other, the girls look into the camera with happiness evident on their faces. The snap of the camera ensures this memory will always have a special place in Elise's heart.

Without having joined an extracurricular activity Elise would never have had the opportunity to make the bonds and friendships she did. Being in a club or sport helps encourage students to be more social with their peers, pursue new hobbies, and give each other¬†opportunities to learn more about themselves and express their interests. Reasons such as these are why I agree that principles at all schools should make the decision requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity.   ¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,7
9DB8409B95F6,"Throughout this essay, I will explore the importance of trusting people, experiences where my trust has been broken, and how to identify bad influences. 

When I was younger, I made a mistake of accepting a bad friendship with someone who pushed me to make decisions I was uncomfortable with. Despite their bad influence, I trusted them and allowed myself to be controlled for fear of losing them. I soon learned that this person had lied to me and was not the friend I thought they were. I lost more than just a friend, but my trust and faith in someone else. This experience made me realize the importance of being able to trust other people and not succumb to changing just because it's difficult to stay firm about who you are. 

It's essential to determine if a person is a good influence or a bad influence. This can be done by assessing how someone makes you feel, what kind of advice they give you, and how they react when you refuse to do something they ask you to do. Good influences are encouraging, supportive, and understand when you make the decision to be true to yourself. On the other hand, bad influences are often manipulative, disloyal, and quick to be dishonest when things don't go their way. 

I learned the importance of trusting people, but also verifying if they will be a positive or negative presence in your life.

95D1717166FC,"Venus is Earth's sister planet. But along with being our sister planet, Venus has the highest recorded temperature of any planet in our solar system. Along with having the highest temperature recorded, Venus also has an atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than the atmospheric pressure on Earth. Clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid also coat Venus's atmosphere, making it difficult to even make it through the outer layers of Venus's atmosphere. So why would Earth's scientists still want to vist Venus?

According to the article, Venus is the planet that is most similar to Earth, well at least it used to be. The author tells the reader about how Venus was probably covered in oceans that could have supported life, similar to Earth. The planet also has many other land forms that are similar to the ones we have here on Earth, such as, valleys, rocks, and craters. The author proceeds to say that ""the value of returning to Venus is indisputable.""

72F756E359DE,"The build up of greenhouse gases and carbon emissions over the past hundred years since the car was first invented have started a decline in the usage of a private car. People are moving back into cities and are suing their cars signifigantly less with places such as Bogota Columbia having a day dedicated to no driving. Bikes and other forms of public transportation have become much more appealing than using a car and this trend looks like it will continue

In source one , in Vauban , Germany they are no longer using cars and instead are using alternative forms of transportation in this suburb. Heidrun walter a resident of this city talked about how he was ""always tense"" when owning a car which is true. It can be very stressful having to drive around and in the case of crowded areas have to sit in traffic for two hours a day. Another reason to get rid of your cars is the effects on the environment with 50% of carbon emissions in some parts of the US being blamed on cars. New laws in the US are also promoting the use of public transportation in the United States own suburbs giving suburban residents more of a reason to rid themselves of a car. In cities public transportation has been already implemented and can be much more efficent than driving around yourself.

The pollution in many cities such as Bejing is very intense and makes living conditions awful. Paris , one of the more polluted cites in Europe experienced a partial driving ban after a build up of smog in the city.

CCB48976ED97,"Dear Principal,

The first reason that would make this a terrible idea is the fact that a C average is the main grade in all schools around the country for eligibility. The other reasons are: how bad do you want the school to look when the sports teams do not have any of it's good players. The other fact is that it would be unfair to the students for you to make some type of sudden change like that when being eligible for a C average was the old rule. Kids would freak out and people probably will not support your new school policy as I am now. This could really start a huge issue against your self and it might even back fire and not work at all, I do not recommend trying this.

I would not agree with your new policy, you should not carry this out it will hurt many students and you may even lose kids from the school that sports means their life to them. So, please take my thoughts into consideration so you do not make a bad decision that may get you not wanted back as principal for next year. Also, if you are going to make this decision at least add it in the student hand book before the year starts so you do not throw everyone off. You will ruin the kids entire year if you do this new school policy. Parents will be raving about it and students will talk about you badly and dislike you greatly.

The only good part about this policy is that it will drive students in their academics to make the extra grades to be able to play on the sports teams. The students will have to become more dedicated mentally than they have ever been before. Your school will get attention by all of the hard work that the students have displayed to pull up the average higher, this could lead to other schools following your policies as well to see how their students do. This is better for the students long term affect, so that they can have better work ethics and maybe keep using them throughout their lives.

Do whatever you think is necessary and should be carried out, but make sure you watch very closely to all of the students to see how they are reacting and if they are doing more well or worse. If your students are doing worse, then I would recommend you to talk to the teachers so that they can try to reach out to the kids more to help them make the grade that is necessary for eligibility. You have good ideas, but just be careful and do not make any mistakes you might regret. Read other students letters to get more opinions about the topic, do your research, and make your decision wisely. I'm sure you will make the correct analysis as to what should be done and what should not be messed with. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope it makes a change and fills your mind with the ideas of a fellow student.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
B8757E80EB9D,"Venus can be a scary planet when it comes down to its features. The writer to this story certanly convinced me that we should not study Venus anymore. We have tried to land spacecraft on the planet before, but none have last no more than a few hours, so how are we supposed to study it when it just keeps destroying our spacecrafts. We haven't tried it again in a decade. The reason to this is that Temperatures vary around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has a thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide. If us humans even take a step on Venus we get crushed. Venus has a 90% atomic pressure, which is greater than what we have on Earth. It could even crush a submarine and those are supposed to outstand pressure from the ocean. Venus isn't a very pretty planet either, it has a familiar features as valleys,mountains, and craters. We could use spacecraft to hover over venus about 30 miles or so above it. Even if we did that we couldn't take sample rocks or gas. Are technology gets better throughout the years, so maybe one day well figure a way out to oustand that heat and pressure. Even if we do that though, what would be the sense if we cant even live on the planet. Half of the stuff we use today will never outstand the heat or pressure that Venus has.

Also in paragraph 7 it was said that none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless and humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel.

If a human doesn't know how to drive a car and relies on the car and you're in a dangerous situation, then the driver and passengers are most likely to be killed.

Safety is the number one most important thing when being in a car. It's the drivers job to make sure everyone in the car and themself is safe. If someone is injured or technology fails, who is at fault- the driver or the manufactuer? Trafiic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.

I'm against driverless cars because Google cars aren't truly driverless, humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel, and who would be responsible if technology fails.           ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

I personally believe that if students brought their cell-phones to school and were able to use them during lunch and other free opportunities that this would be best. It would be best because students could call their families, and if they had them out at lunch they would not use them in class, also students would be better listeners. Students in the end that listen better, are better students.

If students were aloud to have their phones out during lunch and free periods it would be best because they could call their families. this would be nice because they could ask if they would ride the bus after school or if their parents would pick them up. Also, if a student plays sports for the school they could call their parents if practice or a game was canceled. This I believe would be an over all good idea.

Secondly, if students were aloud to have their cell phones out at lunch they would most likely not use them in class. The reason being for this is that students could get everything they wanted done at lunch. There they could text or call their friends and family. The ending result being that the teacher would have better listeners and less distractions.

Lastly I believe that if students were aloud to use cell phones at lunch you have a distraction free environment. Students could actually get their work in class done and would understand subjects better. The teacher would also not have to repeat things more than once. All in all this is a great idea.

In conclusion I believe that if students were aloud to use phones during lunch and other free times they would be less of a distraction. Students could first, call their families, second, most likely not use them in class, and third, students would be better listeners. So in the end, this is my belief.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
2C6CF5AE7B46,"- In the passage ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" explains how Google cofounder Sergey Brin invented driverless cars for the future. I feel like the safest way to get around is cars with drivers in control. I say that because the passege says 'the car will send an alert to the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents,' but what roadblocks lie ahead for the autonomous car? - Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe and I understand that but would we all be safe with a driverless car? I say no because if there's no driver there's no control and if this world didn't have contol it would be nothing but madness and we don't need that. These ""driverless cars'' aren't safe that's why they're illegal to even test in California, Nevada, Florida, and the district of Columbia. Manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe.- What if the car gets into an accident and you or someone else is injured? Would you think it's you fault or the manufacturer's fault? -Automakers are still continuing their work on the ''assumption'' that the problems ahead will be solved, but there shouldn't be no problems because they keep testing them right and said the cars can drive more than half a million miles without a crash so why should there be a problem? - The passage also says ""new laws would have to be passed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident.""

Laws are getting passed everyday like Gay marrage and legallizing marijuana but driverless cars are simply not safe at all and that is my final opinion. Even though the last paragraph of the passage says ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" I feel like that 90 percent is the percentage of danger the car will cause and the other 10 percent is the safest because the driver is in control. This is why I feel driverless cas shouldn't be released in the future.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

The main advantage of camping is that it's a relatively low-cost activity that anyone can do regardless of age. 

Biking is another great activity to do with your family. Biking allows you to explore the great outdoors in a fun and active way.

The ""Car-Free cities"" started in the suburbs of Germany. Almost everyone completely gave up their cars. P2 L1-2 states that stret parking and drivewats and home garages are generally forbidden. If you are not completely car-free you pay $40,000 to buy space to park you car(s) along with a home.

Statistics say that 70 percent of families d not own cars anymore, and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move to Germany. Heidrun Wlter stated ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"".

In Paris, due to near-record pollution, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

On certain days motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. the other days same rules apply to odd-numbered license plate owners.

The more cities that start doing a ban on driving cars' or use more enviroment healthy cars are helping reduce pollution and other toxins in the air. p43 states that the Ford company is already making changes to their cars/trucks to make them more enviromentally safe.

The rate of Kids and aduts between the ages of 16-39 getting their licenes and permits have dropped drastically within the past few years.

I believe you should go with policy 1 its a good idea here are the reasons why, 1 because everyone has them and loves to use them to text there friends its faster and easier than calling. Another reason is that not everyone is in the same class as there best friend so they cant talk to them that much, but if you use this policy they could use the free time you give them and they can use there phone and they can talk to them. Another good reason is that if you use policy 2 people will just use there phone in class when the teacher isn't looking, and they could cheat or they will just get distracted not listen to you and not get the stuff the teachers are teaching and get bad grades, but if you use policy one they wont use there phone in class because they have a free time later to use it in school and they will have it off in there pockets.

According to research cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents. Despite of danger or causing an accident people still text and drive because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Cell phones are good in emergency situations but not while you driving. Although people support using cell phones while driving. That is dangerous and they should avoid talking while driving.

However, because of their habits they can create dangerous and hazardous problem like a collision or an accident. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phone while driving they can harm innocent people. Instead of your eyes locking or glancing at your phone they should be lock on watching their speed and the road.

Texting while driving is a big issue and we doing it every day and not realizing how much we are putting our lives in a danger and putting the others people who on the road lives in dangerous. Leave the phone hands-free while you driving, a text is not worth your life that text still will be there whenever you reach your destination.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

However i think we should all be free of making our own decisions ether you want to make it by your self or you want others with more time and experiences to help or make your decisions, but people should be award of what they choice because every decision can gave a consequence and the only one who can make the right choice is you.",0,original_moth,Task: Write an essay comparing and contrasting self-made decisions with decisions made by people with more expertise and experience.

B08778A20E76,"Driverless cars are on the verge of coming out and will be good for all people on the roads. Driverless cars will nit only take away the risk of human error but will help to decrease accidents that are happening all around the world because of human error. Humans make more mistakes than machines, so driverless cars are less prone to be in accidents.

Machines are very accurate and make very few mistakes if any. As paragraph two says, ""Televisions and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves."" Driverless cars would be a huge breakthrough in science and engineering. I think that there shouldnt be any driverless cars right now, but in a few years the technology that will be out will be safe and trustworthy. I would trust driverless cars in a few more years when the technology is more advanced and sophisticated. In paragraph 2 it says, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars arent truly driverless."" The big car companies agree that the driverless car technology wont be out for a couple of more years because it is too dangerous right now to trust them, they say that cars arent truly driverless yet when it comes to driving in traffic jams or in construction zones because there are some problems that we probably dont know about yet, but through time we can figure out to make the driverless cars more safe.

Another reason why driverless cars would be a better go to is because it coul help from polluting the atmosphere with exaust. In paragraph 1 Sergey Brin envisions fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system that uses half of the fuel that taxi cabs use today. With less fuel consumption, the evnironment and atmosphere will not get as polluted with gas exuast. Also, with less fuel being consumed by the cars, There will be less money spent on gas which could help you save money fo more things that you want.

Another feature that you can get from driverless cars is relaxing and spending more time with the people you are with. If you are by yourself you could catch up with the news or take a quick nap and get some extra rest for wherever you are going. In paragraph 8 it says, ""Some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" So while you are kicked back in your seat you can turn on a movie or bring a book and enjoy your book while your car transports you to your destination.

Driverless cars are the future and will bring many technological advances with it. All through time these self-driving cars will come out and amaze the world with all of their abilities. Whether you are for, or against, everyone will be amazed if these sci-fi vehicles are actually produced and used by the common folk. Until then, the world will wait for the best technological advancement in history to come out.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
7F4E3283ECE3,"I think that this would probably be a good idea. The reason i think this will be a good idea is because the kids have a chance to find there passion if they did not yet already. It may also give the kids a chance to stay active instead of going home and just going on there phones. They can help the school with extra stuff like help making the yearbook. This also can make a student get creative if they want to make there own after school club.

The reason kids have a chance to find there passion is because of the choices that the schools has. If the kid is athletic then the school must have all the sports as a choice and the kid can choice what he likes and if his first pick isnt his favorite he can just choose another sport until he finds the one he likes. Then once he likes it he can join a actual team and get good at it. Or if the school has a actual team for that sport he can tryout and see if he makes the team. If the student likes art they can go the a art class and either work on there art or try to get better and try new art techniques. If the student is into acting or something like that they can do drama class and act in plays and practice there acting skills.

Another reason why i think this is good is because it can keep the kids busy instead of them going home to play on there phones. The students can help the teachers with making¬†yearbooks and¬†if they are good enough they can also take some pictures of the clubs. They can help make events or even if they can they can try to make a fundraiser. They can help pass out material to the teachers for there clubs like paper or pencils if they need it.

Third reason why i think this is good is because the kids can get creative. They can get creative by making there own club. And by putting the club together and also thinking of what other they can do to make other kids join. They have to get an idea on how to make the club interesting and how other kids will like it and want to join. They will have to get all the ideas together and make the club that they want to make.

""Humans have sent many spaceships to Venus but no spacecraft had survived the land for more than a few hours"", said the author. The only reason that we can not stay on the planet is because, one there is a thick atmosphere of alomst 97 percent carbon dioxid. Two becuase in order to get on to the planet you would have to go through clouds and clouds on Venus are not like clouds on Earth. But on Venus they are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Three on the planets surface the tempertures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Four the atmostpheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we have on Earth. And these conditions are far more extreme than ANYTHING on Earth.

Sometimes, when you want a red sweatshirt or a green sweatshirt, you would gather the information that your friends or peers gave you and whatever you got the most suggested you would go for that. For example, my friends said that I would look good in the green sweatshirt, so I got the green sweatshirt because that one came up the most.

We usually look for multiple answers because when you can't decide on something, you would go to your friends or peers to help you. Gathering the information that they all give you could help but not always. Say that you had a tie, you would go with whatever you like the most or you would go to some one for a tie breaker.

78A04054BBA3,"Driverless cars should not be permitted. There are a few small problems that will become major issues if they are not fixed in due time. There are three main reasons why driverless cars should not be permitted. One of the reasons is when accidents occur people will not know who to blame the accident on because it could be the manufacturer's fault or the driver's fault. Another reason is there is not any information about how much money it would cost to create driverless cars based on the text. The final reason is the cars are not really considered ""driverless"" since the driver has to take control on certain occasions.

If or when accidents occur, then who would be the blame? People would not know whether to blame the driver for the accident or the manufacturer of the car. People can claim that the driver is the fault for the accident because it looked like the car spun out of control, or people could say the manufacturer is the blame because it look as if the car was having technical difficulties.

How much money will it cost to create the driverless cars? Finding out how much money it would cost to create these driverless cars is a top priority. However, based on the information in the text, there is not enough information to determine how much it would cost to create the driverless cars. Companies defintely need to look into that before spending lots of money on the creations of driverless cars.

Are the cars considered ""driverless"" since the driver has to take control of the car on certain occassions? If the car was driverless, then why does the driver have to take control while the car is backing out of a driveway? An acctual driverless car would be able to back out of an driveway and avoid accidents without a driver taking control. The driver also has to take control of the car if the car detects an accident on a road ahead. The driverless car should be able to steer right around the accident or should be able to find the shortest route around the accident without the driver having to take control of the car.

Driverless cars should not be permitted because if an accident occurs people would not know who to blame, there is not enough information based on the text about how much money driverless cars would cost, and the cars are not considered driverless since the driver would have to take control of the car on certain occassions like if the car detects an accident on the road ahead or if the car is backing out of a driveway.

FDC077398F13,"The principal just announced a new school rule. The rule says that every student has to participate in at least on after school activity. To some people, this is a great idea. To other, it might not sound too great. In this paper, I will tell you my side on this new rule. Afterwards, I will try to convince you why you should support my claims.

First of all, I should let you know which side I'm on. Whether I support the new rule or not. To be brief , I do support this new rule. The principal took a risk with this. The risk he took is the reaction of the parents and the teachers. Even with all of that though, in the long run, this rule will pay off.

In this paragraph, I will be stating different factors, pros, opinions, and more. Everything I state is to convince you to support my side of this new rule. First of all, the extracurricular activities can make students happier when they choose an activity they love. This can motivate them to work better and harder in and out of school. Secondly, it will push students to be well-rounded. Third of all, it can push kids to do their very best. The coaches, helpers, and other adults in the students' life will push them and have them strive to be great.

Going off of my last paragraph, I will continue listing ways that the new rule is a good thing. The difference is that I will be talking about mostly the parent benefits. First of all, when kids are at their activities, the parents have more time to relax and not worry as much. Also, if every single student is at an activity, then more people can set up carpools. In addition to what I said before, about the student being happier and doing better in school, they can have better behavior and attitude at home. The kids will be happier all around, which can make the parent happier. Some parents may be concerned on how their child will juggle having the activity going on and also maintaining good grades. Eventually, the kid will learn to handle it. This teaches them responsibility. This skill can be used at school, home, and anywhere!

In conclusion, that is my paper. I talked about how the principal introduced a new school rule that every student has to do an extracurricular activity. I talked about how I was all for that rule and the benefits that came with it. How the coaches and other adults can encourage the kids and help them strive for greatness. Also how the activities can teach them responsibility, and make them have better behavior and attitude. I hope by reading this I convinced you to accept and support the new rule. The reason is, in my opinion, the extracurricular activities make the students all around happier people.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3
falcon_180b_v1_391,"I believe that we should transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. There are several reasons why this is important.

Firstly, fossil fuels are finite resources. They will eventually run out, and when they do, we will be left without a source of energy. This could lead to a global crisis, as our modern world relies heavily on energy. Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are infinite. They will never run out, as they are constantly being replenished by the sun, wind, and water.

Secondly, fossil fuels are harmful to the environment. They release greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, do not produce any greenhouse gases. By transitioning to renewable energy, we can reduce our carbon footprint and help to protect the planet.

Finally, renewable energy is becoming more affordable and accessible. As technology improves, the cost of renewable energy is decreasing. This means that it is becoming more economically viable for businesses and individuals to invest in renewable energy.

You often hear people say that teenagers are costing more problem to other people and for the around them environment. The city council should adoption the 10 p. m midnight curfew for teenagers because teens would stay out of problems, and they would have more time to do school work.

To start, the curfew would avoid teenagers being in problem with the law. For example,teens with the curfew would not be in gangs or cost problem to others. Lets say that teens had the curfew it would expand beyond the level of doing good to others and staying out of gangs or doing bad stuff. They would be able to achieve their goals fast and force on what is next in life. Even though, this curfew sounds bad its not bad because teens would learn that the curfew is just to help them and help the environment around them.

Secondly, the curfew would allow teens with more time on their schools work and have time to force on their work. For example, teens would have more time to focus on their schools work than being on the streets with gangs. With that being said teens would have a chance of achieving their dreams and being successful in live without a bad influences. In this scenario, it show that a curfew is not bad because it has some good way in live and it allow people to do good stuff for others. Ultimately, with this curfew it allows young people to see the better side in life and it would help them to stay focus in schools by achieving their work and doing the right things.

Some people may say that having a curfew is unfairly interfere in young people lives. For example, young people have the right to choose the way they want to be. Therefor, being later in night dose not meant that young people are doing bad stuff or their are in gangs also they are just having fun in their way. Thus, being in a curfew it show young people that their are controlling by other people just because they have a different way of having fun. In this scenario, it show that having a curfew is just unfairly for teenagers just because other teens got in trouble it dose not means that all of the young people needs to have a curfew.

In conclusion, the city council would just being helpful to the young people by add a time limit. And it would help the environment around them and it would give more time and focus to the young people. All in all, it is a good thing to put a curfew because teens would have more time to spent with their family and doing good stuff for the environment.",0,original_moth,Task: Research and write an essay about long-term effects that the city council's adoption of a 10 p.m. weekday and midnight weekend curfew for teenagers would have.

9F1CC7603B64,"Hey there!  As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write this essay about the benefits of distance learning for students. 

First of all, let's talk about the advantages of attending classes online.  One of the biggest pros is that it allows students to learn at their own pace.  Like, if you're a super fast learner, you can speed through the coursework and move on to the next topic. Or, if you need a little extra time to grasp a concept, you can take breaks and come back to it whenever you want. It's like having your own personalized learning experience! 

Another cool thing about online learning is that you can learn from anywhere!  Like, you can do your schoolwork on the beach, or in your pajamas, or even while traveling.  It's like having the freedom to learn whenever and wherever you want! 

But,  there are also some disadvantages to distance learning.  One of the biggest cons is that it can be really hard to stay motivated.  Like, if you're not in a physical classroom, it's easy to get distracted and lose focus. And, if you don't have a good schedule, it can be hard to stay on track. 

Another thing is that you might miss out on social interactions.  Like, you don't get to hang out with your friends and classmates as much, which can be really tough for some people.  It's like, you're missing out on that face-to-face communication and collaboration. 

But,  there are ways to overcome these disadvantages!  Like, you can set up a dedicated study space, or join online communities to connect with other students.  It's like, you can still have that social interaction and motivation, even if you're learning online.

As I research the impact of graduating from high school in three years instead of four, I realized that it can have both positive and negative effects on students. On one hand, graduating early can give students a head start in their future careers, as they can enter the workforce or college earlier than their peers. It can also save them money on tuition and living expenses. However, on the other hand, there are some potential risks associated with graduating early.

One of the biggest risks is that students may become tired and overworked if they are pushed to graduate in three years instead of four. High school is already a challenging time, and adding more pressure to complete their studies faster can lead to burnout and decreased motivation. Students may also struggle to balance their coursework and extracurricular activities, which can negatively impact their overall well-being.

Another issue with graduating early is that students may focus too much on certain classes and neglect others. In their quest to finish their studies faster, they may prioritize the classes that are required for their desired career path, while neglecting other important subjects like English, math, or social studies. This can lead to a lack of depth in their knowledge and skills in these areas, which can be detrimental in the long run.

Moreover, students who try to graduate early may not take a summer break, which can be detrimental to their mental and physical health. Summer breaks are essential for students to recharge and refocus, and skipping them can lead to a decrease in motivation and productivity.

Finally, I think it's important to consider why students might want to graduate early. Some may feel pressure from their parents or peers to finish school quickly, while others may want to get a head start on their careers. However, it's essential to consider the potential risks and consequences of graduating early and to make an informed decision based on individual circumstances.

In conclusion, while graduating from high school in three years instead of four can have some benefits, it's crucial to consider the potential risks and challenges associated with it. Students should weigh the pros and cons carefully and make an informed",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

F167D1995565,"First impressions are often the initial judgments we make about a person, place, or thing. They are formed quickly and can be difficult to change. However, research has shown that first impressions are not impossible to change. In this essay, I will explore the effects of culture, practice, and adjustment on first impressions and present evidence to support the idea that first impressions can be altered.

Culture plays a significant role in shaping first impressions. Different cultures have different norms, values, and beliefs that influence how people perceive the world around them. For example, in some cultures, it is considered impolite to make direct eye contact, while in others, it is seen as a sign of respect. If someone from a culture that values direct eye contact were to meet someone from a culture that sees direct eye contact as impolite, they may form a negative first impression of each other. However, with practice and adjustment, this first impression can be changed. For example, if someone from the culture that values direct eye contact were to spend time with someone from the culture that sees direct eye contact as impolite, they may learn to adjust their behavior and make indirect eye contact, leading to a more positive first impression.

Practice also plays a crucial role in changing first impressions. When we encounter new experiences or people, our brains form initial judgments based on the information available to us. However, as we continue to interact with the person or experience, our brain processes more information and can adjust our first impression accordingly. For example, if someone meets someone who they initially thought was rude and aloof, but who later proves to be kind and caring, their first impression may change. This change in first impression is due to the practice of continuing to interact with the person and processing more information about them.

Adjustment is also an essential factor in changing first impressions. When we encounter new experiences or people, our brains form initial judgments based on the information available to us. However, if we later learn that our initial judgment was incorrect, our brain can adjust our first impression accordingly. For example, if someone meets someone who they initially thought was unintelligent, but who later proves to be highly intelligent, their first impression may change. This change in first impression is due to the adjustment of their initial judgment based on new information.

In conclusion, first impressions are not impossible",1,llammistral7binstruct,,9
EDE0E6181F61,"I feel like this would be very useful technology for helping many people in the near future. By having the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) we could tell and understand so much more about the human body that we don't already know about.

The FACS would help us in learning about how exactly how someone is feeling about something or someone. Say, if they could exactly explain how they are feeling we could use the FACS to figure out their emotions. We could also use it in classroom as paragraph 6 says. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" We would finally have the technology to help people who don't understand or are to shy to ask how to do something in the class. The computer would recognize that facial action and go more in depth to help the people who don't understand. Yes, it would make people lose their jobs and bore the other students who already understand the topic but we're still in the beginning faze of the FACS. By using the system we would become way more advanced and learn how to fix these problems. It just takes time to go over and fix. Imagine if we didn't have facial expressions. We wouldn't understand each other and the world would be bland but we do in face have facial expressions and we use them. We've grown adapted to having such a skill but some people don't know how to tell or just can't tell very well. We now put it into technology to help those people and ourselves!

In conclusion, I feel like we would benefit from having and using this technology. As I said above, it would help people understand in schooling, emotions, and in life in general. It would be an even better invention if it became more advanced but we have to use the product for that to happen. I fully support the Facial Action Coding System as it would help us in learning many great things about technology and about ourselves. ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
91BC3AC112A1,"Hi, my name is Luke and I am in the Seagoing Cowboys Program. There are a lot of reasons why I love this program. This proggram is run by UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). They hired me to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. I think you should join this program and help me.

Right away you will notice you can go so many places! If you are a small town boy going on cattle-boat trips, you're in for such a treat. You could possibly go to Europe and China and explore all day. You even get to go to the most special place ever, Acropolis and Greece! Maybe in Greece you'll find yourself at an age old theatre. You could go take a gondola ride in Vence, Italy, a city with streets of water. I got to tour an excavated castle and marveled at the Panama Canel on my way to China.

You may ask yourself,

""How am I suppose to have fun and pass time on board? Its very easy actually, especially on return trips from when the animals have already been unloaded. We all played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. All the time on the boat you can find something to do. You always have time to sight-see while you're on it. You also have time for table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games helped us pass some time.

Even for all the work that had to be done, it wasn't that bad. You had lots of time for sight-seeing since it took a lot of time to get to one place to another. Caring for animals during the crossings kept us busy. It just kept us busy, it wasn't very hard. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lowers holds of the ship. Plus, stalls had to be cleaned. All of this wasn't bad at all, you just had to get use to the routine of it.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure.

It will open up the world to you if you use your time wisely. This program will definitly make you more aware of people in other countries and their needs. That awarness will stay with you, and you and your family could host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

I have heard that you are considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I strongly disagree with this policy. As you can clearly see many of the students have a grade C average. This change will be unfair to a lot of the students. Some student may even rebel against the school.

There are few students who have a grade B average or above. Also most of the schools athletes have a grade C average. If those student were to be kicked out i doubt there will be enough players on the team to play. There is also the fact that activities like the ones we offer help kids stay away from gangs, drugs, and other dangerous activities like those.

1. Picking up trash in a local park or beach - This is probably the easiest thing we can do to help our community. It only takes a few minutes to grab some trash bags and pick up any litter we see while taking a walk or having a picnic. Not only will this make our community look nicer, but it will also help keep our environment clean and healthy.
2. Volunteering at a local animal shelter - If you love animals, this could be a great option! Animal shelters always need extra hands to help take care of the animals and clean their living spaces. You could help walk dogs, play with cats, or even help socialize scared or skittish animals.
3. Organizing a food drive for a local food bank - Food banks help provide food for families and individuals who are struggling to make ends meet. You could organize a food drive at your school or in your neighborhood and collect non-perishable items like canned goods, pasta, and rice.
4. Planting trees in a local park or green space - Trees are super important for our environment because they help clean the air we breathe and provide shade for people and animals. You could work with a local park ranger or conservation group to find a spot to plant some trees and help them grow!
5. Creating a mural or public art project - If you're artistic, you could create a mural or public art project in a local park or other public space. This could be a fun way to add some color and beauty to your community, and it could also help bring people together and promote creativity.

I think the easiest activity to start with is picking up trash in a local park or beach. It's something that can be done on my own or with a group of friends, and it only takes a few minutes.

9715AAF5B952,"First impressions are the initial opinions we form about someone or something when we first meet them. These impressions are often based on nonverbal cues, such as appearance, body language, and tone of voice. However, first impressions can change over time as we learn more about the person or situation.

In social contexts, first impressions can be particularly important. When we first meet someone, we may make assumptions about their personality, interests, and values based on their appearance and behavior. For example, we may assume that someone who is dressed in a suit and tie is more professional and serious than someone who is dressed casually.

However, as we spend more time with the person, we may discover that our initial assumptions were incorrect. For example, we may find out that the person who was dressed casually is actually very knowledgeable and experienced in their field. On the other hand, we may find out that the person who was dressed in a suit and tie is actually quite laid-back and easygoing.

In business contexts, first impressions can also be important. When we first meet a potential client or colleague, we may make judgments about their character and trustworthiness based on their appearance and demeanor. For example, we may assume that someone who is dressed professionally and speaks confidently is more trustworthy than someone who is dressed casually and speaks hesitantly.

However, as we work with the person, we may discover that our initial assumptions were incorrect. For example, we may find out that the person who appeared to be very confident and trustworthy actually had some personal issues that they were dealing with. On the other hand, we may find out that the person who appeared to be less professional and trustworthy actually had some great ideas and was very innovative.

Personally, I have experienced how first impressions can change over time. When I first met my current best friend, I thought they were very quiet and reserved. However, as we spent more time together, I discovered that they were actually very outgoing and had a great sense of humor. Similarly, when I first started working at my current job, I thought my boss was very strict and demanding. However, as I got to know them better, I discovered that they were actually very supportive and willing to listen to my ideas.

54537C49501D,"Yes the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The Facil Action Coding System technology is valuable because. It could help the students learn lessons easier and better. As it says in paragraph 6 line 7 through 10 stating that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Students that have the Facial Action Coding System technology avilable to them would learn faster then some of the other students in the classroom. The FACST (Facial Action Coding System Technology) can see and understand the emotion of the student in the case if a student is getting confused or not. Sometimes a student might be messing around and want to lie and be funny and act like he is confused but the FACST (Facial Action Coding System Technology) can understand the student better and figure out if the student is really confused or just lying. When the FACST (Facial Action Coding System Technology) recongizes that a student is really confused or lost. Say if it's a reading assignment and the student speaks and only understands spanish and if the spanish audio is going to fast. The FACST can see a bit of confusion and worrying on the students face and it could modify the lesson to make the audio go slower so the spanish speaking student can understand what he is being read better. The FACST could also recongize if a studemt is depressed or sad and the students or parents and teachers don't know about it yet it could possibly just email it to the teacher of the student amd to the parents. Saying something for example you'r child today wasn't very focused and seemed a bit depressed you should have talk with you'r child.

d8c47874,"Dear State Senator, It has come to my attention the many problems that the Electoral College has. I would like to ask that we change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. You see, not only is the Electoral College unfair, but it also creates a lie that tricks everyone into believing that our President was the one that the majority of America voted for, when that is not always the case.

First off, the fact that the number of electors for each state relies on the number of members in it's Congressional delegation is just illogical...lets say Florida has twenty because of its size, and California has fifty. if both states want to vote for someone different, then California is going to win only because of the size and population difference. So really, you aren't voting for the president...you're voting for the electors who will choose the president. An argument can be made against this...that the electors that you give your vote to will be trustworthy and vote for the person that your party wants. How does that give us a say though? For example, as it says in the article, Al Gore was the president that the majority of America voted for in 2000...he was the one that everyone wanted. Yet he lost the presidency because of this form of voting. This is a free country, or so we're told, so we need to be given the right of popular vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system is flawed...there are millions of people in America and yet only 538 votes are counted. There is no way to be assured that the person you voted for, or anyone else, was selected. We need to ask ourselves what the best thing is for our country... letting everybody be dissapointed in who was voted for, or seeing that they got what they spent time on going and voting on. This isn't just a captain for a football team, or a manager at work. This is the president of the United States, and he or she will be running our country for 4 years or even longer, so we need to question this method of voting. We are a unified country, and our unity shows what we want as a country..we shouldn't have one thing chosen and get something completely different in return. The election by popular voting would be a better overall choice for our country.

All in all, arguments can be made both ways...for the Electoral College process or against it. The citizens of America deserve the very best person to lead them, and that's exactly who we should get...the one that America votes for. I know that there are more efficient and fair ways to do this, all we need to do is use them. At the end of the day though, using the election by popular vote would ensure that everyone would be 100% sure that their vote went for who they wanted, and that's what counts.",0,train_essays,,6
AAA152F374E0,"Today, there are many arguments between keeping our governments way of electing a new president. Many people have turned their back on the Electoral College saying that it is unfair and are instead for changing to election by popular vote. The Electoral College is seen as a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes is the winner. Therefore it is the electors who elect the president, not us people. Some people even see the Electoral College as unfair. outdated, and irrational and see arguments against direct elections spurious. While some have different opinions saying that the Electoral College, although its lack of democratic pedigree, is very practical.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required a elect a president. Your state's amount of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. One for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. So, technically when you vote for your candidate you're actually voting for your candidate's electors. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. All in all, it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.

Most states do award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, some things in a state could create a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. A tie is possible because the total number of votes is an even number, but is highly unlikely. In the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states that are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. Statistically, the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balnce that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionmen of the senate decrees in the constitution. So, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The argument between keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has many different sides to it. Through facts and opinions, there is many reasons our government should keep the Electoral College and some reasons that we should change to election by popular vote. In some ways the Electoral College can be unfair but in others it makes complete sense. The people who vote in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference not people who think that a single vote could decide an election. Therefore, the Electoral College could be a good thing in our government today keeping things organized and sometimes fair.       ¬†       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
CEC5B40D1688,"The technology that humans have developed is very advance; a lot of time has been dedicated to it, so society can have a better and easier way to access to technology. However, as all things that are crated by man are not perfect, and it has its positive and negative impacts on people. A lot of those impacts that technology have are negative impacts. For example, you loose the opportunity of interacting with other people, you can get addicted to technology, and you can get lazy, and all these negative impacts affect the new generation the most. The little kids end up playing video games their entire childhood; instead of playing outside, and making new friends.

First, technology it is not just to have fun with; you can play video games, but keep in mind that if you abuse of the use of technology you are going to get addicted in a very short period of time. Spending all your time in technology have its consequences. You loose the opportunity to be in contact with the people around you, you can loose your friends if you had any, and most important you can loose your communication that you once had with your parents. You can have hundreds of friends on social media, but it is not worth it if you do not spend time with them. Also one of the most negative impact is that little kids are getting addicted to technology. They are spending most of their childhood playing video games, and doing things that are not going to do any good for them in the future. They should be playing outside with their friends, and enjoying their childhood which is one of the most beautiful things they have. When you are a little kid you are so innocent that you do not have to worry about any problems the adults may have, and you do not have any problems to worry about either. Unfortunately that childhood have to end at some point because nothing last forever, but in the meantime you just have to live your childhood and not worry about any video games.

Second, you can use the internet for any need you may have, for there are hundreds of websites of anything you would like use. For example, shopping online, checking out book, and get any information you want. Some other websites are not quite useful like scams, or some websites that contains virus. At some point you may or may not run into a scam website which are used to obtain personal information that you have put online. They can get that credit card information that you used for your online shopping, your social security number, or even your own bank account number. There are people that work on trying to protect your personal information; they use their knowledge for the good of society, but there are also people who uses their skills and try to get your personal information, and use it for their own benefit. Keep in mind that those people can be smarter than you, and they can take every single dollar that you have in your bank account if you put your information at risk.

Third, you become lazier when you can get any information you want without making a big effort because you have everything at the reach of your hand by having access to the internet. You got so used to getting things fast and without making an effort, and when you have to wait to get any kind of information you get frustrated, for the fact that you have to go through a whole book, so you can that information. Man have been making your life easier by creating all the technological advances you have now. For example, you do not have to make an effort to wash your clothes, or wash the dishes you have been given all of that, so you have became lazier.

At the end technology can result positive impact to society; it has made our life easier, but it has resulted in a negative impact for the new generations. It has made the youth lazier than it was in the old times; teenagers are now addicted to social media, and we are loosing the communication with our parents which is very important to have. Little kids are loosing their childhood in result of the new technological advances that allows them to be playing video games and not going outside to make friends.

07A88E52FC70,"What if you were doing a extracurricular activity and wanted to share the joy of it with everyone else? I do agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Having a extracurricular activity helps students become more social, more active, and provides people with information that is not taught in school.

A extra curricular activity can allow people to become more sociable and make more friends. This is possible because there are probably other people who want to join the same clubs as other peers. People in the same club can then become friends with people that have the same interests that they do. For example, say you join a sports team. You must be able to work well with them in order to win games, therefore you must socialize with your other teammates and become friends with them.

Students can also become more active in exercising, school, the environment, and the community. Ways to become more active in exercising is by joining a sports team, in a sports team you exercise all the time in order to preform properly in your chosen sport. Students can become more active in school by joining the student¬†council. When you join the student council you help organize events that can be seen as enjoyment for the other students, or it can help raise money for other school activities. Next, students can have a better impact on the environment. To do this students can join the gardening club or a

GO GREEN

club, which helps the plants and animals near your school. Lastly, by joining an extracurricular club you can also help your community. For example by joining

NJHS

or girl/boy scouts. These two clubs have you do activities that help out in the community, like helping the elderly or bagging food for the homeless.

Lastly, joining a extracurricular activity can provide students with a more in depth¬†look on subjects that they are interested in. Therefore, it is wise for students to join clubs for subjects that are not taught in depth in school. For example science, art, or writing. This can also help students figure out what they want to do with their future, and if different activities would interest them or not.

In my opinion, I do agree that every students should be required to do a extra curricular activity. Even though having a extracurricular activity can allow less time for homework, or can negatively effect you grades. A extracurricular activity can benefit students in many ways from them becoming more active in school and the community, making more friends that could last a life time, or the can provide students with a bigger outlook on activities that they want to pursue when they get older. Therefore, I still believe that having an extra curricular activity is beneficial to students, people just have to work a bit harder to maintain the grades that they need for school.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Vauban's streets are completely ''car-free'', this means that no one except for the main thoroughfare and a few streets on one edge of the community have cars. This movement is called ''smart planning.''

This movement helps the greenhouse gas emissions in Erope. Passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this evidence is given in paragraph 5.

When under pressure it is always good to seek help from others but how do you know if its good?.If you have a choice it is better to get multiple opinions ,as people go thought different experiences,you can filter out and average the advice, there are always going to be biased opinions.

It is wise to get multiple opinions because people go through a different¬†experiences. this is important because many peoples values are not the same,as how you grew up and information you have learned varies from person to person. After trying out for the school play i had been casted as ensemble. Debating whether i should drop out because of my minor role. I decided¬†to ask a few friend about the issue. One friend had a bad experience in a previous show saying that it is never fun and if you dont have the part¬†you want you should drop out. another friend that had a good experience in a minor role said it was fun and helps you get experience even if in the background. I value both as good friends and trust there opinions. In the end i decided to keep the role and stay in the show because even if not a major role you can improve and get experience for the next one. Multiple opinions are important because anyone with a different experience can have different views. These biases can be positive or negative, and with multiple opinions you can look over all options and sort out the pros and cons of each.

It is better to get multiple opinions and advise because you can filter out and average what you need from the advice. Averaging out the advice is a good method because you can find the pros and cons of the situation leading you to¬†a better answer. Before starting the interesting hobby that is cosplay (spending time and money to make different character costumes to wear year round) i wanted to ask family and friends what they thought ,as this was a big decision. Many of them said that it was weird and that i should stay away from this community. Others who had cosplayed before said it was a good idea but a lot¬†of effort . i combined these ideas and values with my own and created a pros and cons list . On one half i would have to work hard and put in effort to afford and create these costumes. On the other half it would be worth it to have a creation you can wear , get attention from,and the bonus of joining a fun and supportive community. In the end i became a cosplayer¬†.Multiple opinions are important because you can make a pros and cons list learning from others mistakes,so you can make better decisions .

Multiple opinions are needed to make a choice because their are always going to be biases . Being biased is unavoidable ,on purpose or not everyone is influenced by opinion . Being biased is based off the experiences and values you have .Before playing a team sport you are asked to pick teams . You have already picked most of your members and there are a few kids left . One of the kids left is your friend .You want to pick them but feel you should ask the rest of the team to get their opinions. We start to talk about picking them or not. One teammate had gotten into a fight with someone from that kids friend group so he disagreed¬†saying¬†she doesnt¬†want him on the team. Another teammate liked him but they werent friends so he agreed with two others that also didint want him. If i had picked this friend without asking the others it could have started a fight. I was biased to have that friend on the team because of past experiences. Their biases and experiences helped switch my opinion for the better. It is important to get multiple opinions because people will always be biased for good or for bad.

AD175892EC1C,"Hey, so like, I know some people might think that online classes are the way to go, but in my opinion, attending school is way more beneficial. I mean, sure, online classes can be convenient and all, but there's just something about being in a real classroom with other people that makes it better.

First of all, you get to learn from other people's perspectives. When you're in a classroom, you can see how other people are thinking and learning, and you can learn from them. You can ask questions and get help from your teacher and classmates, and you can work together to solve problems. Online classes don't have that same level of interaction, and it's harder to get help when you need it.

Another thing is, you can't replace the social aspect of school. You get to hang out with your friends and make new ones, and you can build relationships with your classmates that can last a lifetime. When you're taking online classes, you don't get that same level of social interaction, and it can be really lonely.

And let's not forget about the structure of school. When you're in a classroom, you have a set schedule and you know what you're supposed to be doing at what time. You can plan your day and know that you're going to be learning something new every day. With online classes, it's easy to fall behind or lose motivation, because there's no one there to keep you on track.

Plus, you can't beat the feeling of accomplishment you get when you finish a school day. You know that you've learned something new and you can feel proud of yourself. With online classes, it's harder to feel that sense of accomplishment, because you don't have the same level of interaction and support.

In conclusion, attending school is way more beneficial than taking online classes. You get to learn from other people, build relationships, and have a structured day with a sense of accomplishment. So, even though it might be more convenient to take online classes, I think it's worth it to be in a real classroom with other people.",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Write an essay comparing attending school vs online classes.

llama_70b_v1477,"Introduction:

The development of driverless cars is a topic that has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years. While some people see it as a revolutionary innovation that will change the way we travel, others are skeptical about its safety and practicality. In the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. In this essay, I will argue in favor of the development of driverless cars, using details from the article to support my position.

Body:

One of the main advantages of driverless cars is their potential to reduce the number of accidents on the road. According to the article, driverless cars are programmed to follow traffic laws and avoid reckless behavior, which means that they can significantly reduce the number of accidents caused by human error. This is a significant benefit, as accidents caused by human error are a leading cause of death and injury on the road. Additionally, driverless cars are equipped with advanced sensors and cameras that allow them to detect potential hazards and react faster than human drivers. This means that they can avoid accidents that human drivers might not be able to avoid.

Another benefit of driverless cars is their potential to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. The article states that driverless cars can travel closer together than human-driven cars, which means that they can fit more cars on the road, reducing traffic congestion and improving travel times. This is especially important in cities, where traffic congestion is a major problem that can lead to frustration, wasted time, and lost productivity.

Furthermore, driverless cars have the potential to improve mobility for people who are unable to drive. According to the article, driverless cars can provide independence for people who are elderly, disabled, or visually impaired, allowing them to travel without the need for a human driver. This can greatly improve their quality of life and increase their independence.

However, there are also some concerns about the safety and reliability of driverless cars. Some people are worried that the technology might not be reliable, and that driverless cars might cause accidents or malfunction. While these concerns are valid, I believe that they can be addressed through rigorous testing and regulation. The article states that many companies are already testing driverless cars, and that government regulations are being put in place to ensure their safety.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the development of driverless cars is a promising innovation that has the potential to improve road safety, reduce traffic congestion, and improve mobility for people who are unable to drive. While there are some concerns about their safety and reliability, I believe that these can be addressed through rigorous testing and regulation. Overall, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the drawbacks, and I am in favor of their development.",1,llama_70b_v1,"In the article ‚ÄúDriverless Cars are Coming,‚Äù the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

7504FC6D03BD,"Cars are not something that have to be used everyday. Limiting car usage could be a good thing to do. Minimizing car usage gives you the opportunity to have more parks and fun places to go without the parking lot taking up all the space.

Less space for parking makes everything more easier to get to which is an advantage instead of having to walk in the parking lot . For example, "" . . . make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6 ). This explains that if you get rid of the cars theres more space to park and everything else becomes easier to get to versus having many parking spaces taking up room and causing traffic and other things. Also with not using cars theres more room for small stores and big stores to be put in different places that couldnt be put there because of cars so you could drive. For example, "" . . . stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6 ) and "" Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour retsrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky, Paragraph 28). This shows that now there's more spaces for even more stores which is an advantage because the cars used to take up that space used for bigger roads for more cars to come on but without that problem theres room for other thing's.

Also it's a good way to save money because it decreases smog, and air polllution. For example, "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" ( Paris bans driving due to smog, Robert Duffer, Paragraph 14).¬† This shows that after France decided to stop using cars the smog decreased tremendisely. Having no vehicles can also make the environment better because there wouldnt be a lot of carbon being produced. For example, "" . . . it will have a benificial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" ( The End of Car Culture, Elisabeth Rosentha, Paragraph 34). Which is an example of how it could better for the environment. An advantage also is there will be less pollution. For example, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution . . ."" This explains that it would be a good thing for us , we would have better breathing and also again a better environment .

In Conclusion, Minimizing driving usage could lead to better things such as less pollution, a better environment , and lastly more room for other things . So theyre are many advantages to minimizing driving usage, it's not so bad.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
73C9ACF023C7,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it is a very good thing for all kids our age to do community service. It helps out with pollution and helps keep our town clean.

Some kids like to do it but some kids don't. Most of us think it takes time away from fun activities we do over weekdays and weekends. I highly suggest that we make a sign-up board in the cafeteria for kids who want to work certain hours. I think Wednesday through Saturday is suitable. We can sign up and pick put 5 to 10 people we want to be in our groups. I think groups will help this problem.

I think most kids don't like it because there not working with their own very close friends. I honestly feel that way too. We all want to have fun and enjoy helping out.

Now as far as the helping out with Elementary kids goes, I think we can do the same thing. We can all come up with fun ideas for the kids and do it with them. On summer days we can do fun activities outside and have food and drinks. I think the School board wont mind if we use a tiny bit of money on pizza or chips. If they do I think we could chip in some money. When it is cold and winter we could do activities in the classrooms. We can have movies and hot chocolate. We can also bring board games for the kids.

I hope you really consider this letter. I feel it's a good way to help out,

Walking or riding bike is the cleanest way to do all these things at once. The more people that are not using cars, the more accidents will be prevented. And there is no limit to how many people you can walk with. There's no cost to walk, you just do it. It's something the whole family can do together and enjoy the journey somewhere rather than being on their devices. In addition, fuel is not emmiting from your body into the atmosphere rupturing the Ozone creating all this Global Warming. Creating a world where transportation vehicles are obsolete will nt only benefit the people of this world, but the planet itself, and for the future generations.

Accidents would be almost non-exsistent if we were to gert rid of motherized vehicles. In the article, ""in German suburb, life goes on without cars"" the author talks about how there are already cities in the world that have not banned cars, but choose not to use them. The people in those areas are close to no accidents at all. If there are no cars in the road then how can there be a car accident? The way the Germans started to remove cars from the road is by removing parkig lots. There are only two anywhere in that suburb and they are so inconvient.

Any doctor in the world no matter how young, or where they live will tell their patients that exercise is the only way to stay healthy, energized, and feeling young throughout their life. Without cars getting from one place to another will require another means fr transportation. Now either wait for the bus and be late or wake up a little earlier and walk or ride your bike. It's cheap and effective not only for you but the enviorment.

Fuel creates a gas that later rips open holes in the Ozone layer. Creating Global Warming which then in turn leads to higher taxes to allow for more money to be used in research to save it. Or you can take action now and save up for a bike rather than a car. It takes less management and doesnt take fuel. Just good old man power. It's tradgic in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", ""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue."" this world is what we are leaving our children and their children to live in. Make sure you leave it better than when you came.

In the four articles they all talk about the negative in driving rather than the positive. The reason is because there are more negatives to the industrialiaztion of a car rather than just going back to the way our ancestors used to be. Even our young as our vary own parents are amazed at how much damage this generation is doing to themselves and everything around them. It is the result of inventions like the automobile.

A0F328ADB40C,"I believe that students should not be allowed to have their phones at school and use them when they are not in class.

Most students that bring their phones to school need them after school to call and see who is going to pick them up, or if they are going to go walking.

When students don't have their phones with them in class it makes them just want to sit in their chair and just listen to the teacher.

Teachers as well would say that students should not have their phones at school, because they are tired of taking it away and tired of hearing it ring or vibrate during the class time.

BB06ADBF1640,"Attending school is a vital step in any individual's life and is imperative to achieving future success. School provides an array of experiences and lessons that cannot be taught outside of the classroom. Education helps to foster the development of necessary life skills such as problem solving, communication, and critical thinking. In addition, formal schooling introduces students to a number of career pathways that can shape their educational and professional paths for years to come.

However, prioritizing school is not always a simple task. Some students may struggle to stay focused due to the variety of distractions brought on by life outside of the classroom. Financial obligations, mental health issues and family responsibilities can take precedence and lead some students astray from their primary focus of attending school. For example, Samantha was unable to attend college due to the financial strain and having to become the primary provider for her household. Despite her determination to further her studies, she was met with a delayed success. 

The importance of attending school is inarguable and should not be taken lightly. With every educational opportunity, come a multitude of greater opportunities.

2D30BE5A3A1A,"Are you excited for the summer? Finally having warm weather again, going to the beach and spending the free days with friends and family? Students cannot wait for summer break. Nevertheless, school should not be completely forgotten; therefore, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. That helps students to catch up with their classes and to be ready to go back in the fall. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know their students and can help them individually, teachers have been students when they were younger and have experience and many students are too lazy and unorganized to pick a project by themselves.

Not everyone would agree with that position. Some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed because students can tell what they need to study to be ready for the next school year. No one knows better than themselves what they are good at and where they need to improve. For example, Generic_Name is going to do a summer project in 2020. She organizes all by herself because she knows what she needs to catch up with. Generic_Name can combine her interests with learning and is going to be ready for the next school year with a student-designed project.

Nevertheless, there are other viewpoints to consider.

To begin with, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know their students and can help them individually. For example, my aunt is a high school teacher and her students have to do a project during summer break. She teaches biology and knows her students very well. She gives them a topic for the summer project, which includes specific learn methods for every student. This shows that teachers can help their students individually and know what they need to catch up with to start positive in the new grade and not already be lost in the beginning of the year.

In addition, teachers have been students themselves when they were younger. They have experience about summer projects and can help students to organize them. For example, when Generic_Name, a teacher at Generic_School, gives summer projects, he can help his students a lot because he had to go through the same things¬†when he was a student, but now he knows the best way how to handle those summer projects and can bring his experience to the students.

Finally, many students are too lazy and unorganized to pick the project and give directions to themselves. They might choose an easy project that they already know about, so they would not learn about something new and waste their time. For example, in the book ""Conni & Co"", the main character Conni has to do her summer project by herself without any help. She tries her best. She makes a plan and is motivated before the break starts. It turns out that her plan is very unorganized and she spends almost everyday of her break with her friends but does not focus¬†on her project. She also picks a topic about horses, which she is very familiar with and thinks she does not need so much time because of that. Conni starts the night before the first day of school ,but, obviously, it is too late and she ends up with not finishing her project. That movie is the perfect example that summer projects should be teacher-designed because with the help of teachers students can get more organized, learn more and can get their work done.

In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know their students and can help them individually, teachers have been students when they were younger and¬†have experience and many students would be too lazy and unorganized to pick a project by themselves. Teachers know how to organize those projects and make them learn effective for the students. So if your school requires you to complete summer projects, ask your teachers. They would love to help you continue learning during the break and want only the best for your future.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

C9476E86A834,"Certain school districts offer online classes and video conferences as a way to complete high school. Although various students have disabilities or individualized circumstances which require them to partake in school activities from home, the average student would not benefit from completing school at home because students would sacrifice vital social interactions, students would not be adequately equipped for the workplace,¬†and students would ultimately¬†be excluded from¬†a traditional high school experience. For most students, school is better experienced in a physical building where students will be able to receive more than simply an education. Students in physical schools also receive specialized components which will assist them through various aspects of their lives.

To begin with, students participating in strictly online courses are excluded from the privilege¬†of interacting with their peers on a daily basis. The bonds students form with other classmates are enforced by daily conversing. Students enrolled in online school are isolating themselves and depriving themselves of the opportunity to be surrounded with youths in similar age groups and similar ways of self expression. Isolation and loneliness can easily lead to depression if a student is susceptible¬†to such mental illnesses. Students who find themselves lacking social interactions can possess low self esteem because they are not receiving validation from people they respect. The most obvious effect of isolation¬†is simply boredom, for a student spending no time with other students is guaranteed¬†to experience a harsh level of loneliness.

Moreover, students enrolled in online school are not being prepared for a professional environment in the same level as students in public or private school. In physical schools, students are subjected to various tasks and situations which mimic those in the workplace. Students completing schooling from home will not experience situations such as collaborations or presentations. Collaborating with people that possess conflicting skill sets and opinions is an ability students should be exposed to from a young age so they are better equipped to deal with it in their occupations. Oral presentation skills should also begin developing at a young age to improve public speaking and anxiety affiliated with public speaking as an adult. Students in online school also lack motivation given from other students. Encouragement from peers is an uplifting strategy to gain motivation and complete a task to the best of one's ability.

Additionally, youths completing school from home are missing out on a¬†classic high school experience. The high school experience can be regarded in many different ways depending on the person in question. A majority of adults would describe it as basic element of a semi privileged life.¬†Although different people experience negative and positive emotions throughout the duration of high school, a plethora of individuals create lasting memories and cherish their traditional high school years. Impacting events during high school include finding a passion, attending school sponsored events, and joining a club or sport. School is essential in shaping a person's interests because it allows people to find other people with common interests. Students in public and private schools are more likely to discover their hidden preferences because they are generally encouraged to do so by the administration and staff.

In conclusion, students will not benefit from participating in school strictly online or through online video conferences because they are sacrificing any potential advancement in social skills, they are not as likely to succeed in a traditional occupation, and they are not given a genuine high school experience. If able students do not attend public school, their overall success will be diminished. It is imperative that the majority of students complete their education in a physical environment.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9

6397201c,"Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether we should keep it or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from multiple sources, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for several reasons.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate‚Äôs share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the possibility of a dispute over the outcome is lower compared to a direct popular vote. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, even though he only had 51.3% of the popular vote. This shows that the Electoral College tends to create a clear winner.

Another important reason to keep the Electoral College is to ensure that the president is everyone's president. With its requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This encourages candidates to campaign in different regions and consider the interests of all Americans. By having candidates with broader appeal, we can avoid the feeling of disenfranchisement that residents of certain regions may experience if they believe their votes do not count.

The Electoral College also brings attention to swing states. In the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, it is mentioned that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes leads candidates to focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states. This means that voters in these states, who are most likely to decide the election, pay closer attention to the campaign. By engaging these voters, we can ensure that the most thoughtful and informed citizens have a say in choosing the president.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance the influence of big states. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the Electoral College restores some weight to large states that would otherwise be overshadowed by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns and interests of citizens in large states, as winning their votes can have a greater impact on the election outcome.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, such as Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College has provided a clear winner. This eliminates the need for complicated additional elections and ensures a more efficient and decisive process.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented in the text by Bradford Plumer, the information provided in Judge Richard A. Posner's text provides practical reasons for retaining it. It fosters certainty in the outcome, ensures that the president represents all Americans, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of big states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept. It may have its flaws, but it provides a practical and effective method for electing the president of the United States. It promotes fairness, ensures the president represents all citizens, and balances the influence of different states. Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter.

E8C1C58F8A0A,"In the introduction, the author is describing Venus and explaining how ""The Evening Star."" Is the nickname, but beyond that- paragraph 1 and 2 wasn't explaining why you should pursuit it.

However one statement that does in paragraph 2 is ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" Meaning it's not that far away to reach.

Yet one paragraph that is arguing with wanting to go to Venus is ""Each previous mission was unamed, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

However one statement from paragraph 4 that shows that they wanna go to Venus is ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This paragraph also claims that Venus was most likely covered with oceans and still supported different forms of life.

In paragraph 5 though, one of the statement claims ""not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" Stating that Venus's climate and other factors made being there a pain, but again, it's for sure possible.

In paragraph 5 as well it says ""(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.""

Going a little further, paragraph 6 just explains that to understand more about Venus, that they would have to get much closer, and also describes how scientists are working on innovations that would make the tech and gear that is necessary better and able to last longer.

They are doing so because they can't understand as much when they have no evidence

Paragraph 7 has no claims on how you should go to Venus whatsoever, but instead it is talking about older tech used in the 1800s.

However in Conclusion, in paragraph 8 they stated ""Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Another line that they used is ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubt."" Saying that no matter how many risks just so happen to be in Venus, perhaps if we were able to get there worry free, we'd come back with things we didn't know from before. ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
EDA297550E87,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" wants others to believe that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. The author supoorted his supported his ideas in very well ways that I will explain to you now.

He believes that people should study it because they are making more ways for us to get knowledge about it, he also describes how interesting Venus is, and because you gain insight of the planet itself.

NASA is working on a solution for humans to study Venus in a new way. As stated in the article ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rooling Venusian landscape.""(Paragraph 5). He's saying they are trying to create a vehicle that will let them study mars from above instead of landing on the planet. This supports his idea because this solution that they're creating is, ""survivable for humans"" (paragraph 5).

He describes many features, interesting feautres about Venus. In the article it states that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit,"" (paragraph 3). This a true fact that might spark the interests of humans to study Venus a bit more. Also he states that "" Venus may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" (paragraph 4). Who wouldn't want to study a planet that could've possibly had life exsistence since it was so Earth-like.

Studying Venus is a huge challenge. It has proved that in many ways but that's another reason why the author encourages us to study it. He feels as stated in the article, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" (paragraph 8). Meaning that we should not limit our studies because of danger. His opinion is that we should keep studying, ""to meet the vey edges of our imagination"", (paragraph 8). We shouldn't have to imagine things that we have opportunities to see it real life.

In conclusion, he made very good points that support his ideas. Maybe one day these ideas will inspire someone to actually study Venus and face the challenges that comes with it. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
C4EEFF2FEC23,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author believes that Venus is worthy of human research and time although the task poses multiple dangers. I stand by the authors claim because we would gain information on how our universe works, and how it was many millions of years ago. The article states that although Venus is sometimes ""around the corner"", humans have sent many unmanned spacecrafts to attempt to explore and learn about Venus as a planet. Those spacecraft have not survived landing for more than a couple of hours. This has discouraged humans enough that we have yet to send another spacecraft to Venus in over three decades.

The challenges are very rough and will not be anywhere close to a easy task. First they have to get through a thick atmosphere almost consisting of 97% carbon dioxide. After the atmosphere, you will have to survive the clouds which consist of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Then you would need to figure out how to help deal with its average surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system.

Next, you'll have to create something sturdy enough to withstand its atmospheric pressure which amost 90 times geater than Earth's. The geolocial features and weather such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes will also aid in ruining the journey.

If we can overcome these obsticles we could learn much more about Venus's past, present, and future. The more knowledge we have will help to futher even more research and hopefully explore even more in our universe.",0,persuade_corpus,,9

My favorite part of being a Seagoing Cowboy would probably be helping people. I went out and looked for people in distress. I tried to help them as best as possible. I adored helping people even before I joined this group so I loved this part.

When I wasn't helping people I would treat my self to some site seeing. I loved seeing the Acropolis in Greece. That was my favorite! I also saw Europe, China, I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, I saw an excavated castle in Crete, and the Panama Canal.

I also had a few scary times like one time I was just about to fall overboard on my night-watch, but this little piece of metal stopped me.

When I was on my way home and we had already loaded off all of the animals, I would play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. I also read!

I kept going on these amazing trips and now I feel as if I have been everywhere! I'm sure that if you take this offer and join the Seagoing Cowboys then you will have plenty of stories to tell children and relatives.

Remember that all of this was a huge oppertunity for a small town boy like me. I was just a boy dreaming of changing the world and now I have lived that dream. Now it is time for me to help you live your dream!",0,persuade_corpus,,9
2D88A5F1C0C3,"Presidents are leaders that are chosen by the people. Presidents are chosen by the Electoral College. ""

The Electoral College is a process not a place"" according to the article Does the Electoral College work

?. It consists of 538 electors and a mojority of 270 votes is required to elect the President. So why change it to a popular vote now? I think that we are doing great with the Electoral College.

First of all, I think we should keep the Presidents' election to the Electoral College because the Founding Fathers established it to compromise a vote to elect our leader and we should keep it that way because it has worked for years. In

Source 1: What is the Electoral College it says ""

The Electoral College is not a process, not a place. The Founding Fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise

"". This is why we shouldn't change process because as soon as we try to change it we would mess up the sequence.

Secondly, wherever there is something good there is something bad. The Electoral College isnt perfect and it has had its flaws so I do think we should use the Popular Vote because of the winner- take-all systems in each state preventing a fair vote. The term "" The Bigger they are the Harder they fall"" it doesnt work in this part. The bigger the state the bigger the vote. Its unfair because states like Texas the people who they vote for always gets an edge in elections and small states like Mississippi gets small parts in voting.

Lastly, the Electoral College is a better choice because it gives each state a chance to go for who they believe is going to win. Competition is something we all do and we should be able to compete in the sam league no matter how big or how small a state is.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
B4528CE5BB12,"I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College ""winner takes all"" system. It has been working well for the past couple of presidents. Yes, it might be unfair for thoses who are wanting to be electors and can't because the person they are running for lost but the ones who did win are doing what they believe is right. Just because of one big out break in 2000 doesn't mean the system will fail again. It will gradually progress trough out time and soon it won't ever fail again. You just never know unless you let it continue until it doesn't work any longer and when it does you find a new, better system that will work for decades. In 2000 people might have switched their votes because they thought that person desirved it not the other guy. The system of ""winner takes all"" hasn't failed since 2000. It works so why get rid of it. If it were to fail multiple times then yes get rid of it and find something new but it hasn't.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
85410ec2,"Keeping the Electoral College is not smart for the united states voting system. First, many citizens all over the country don't agree with the voting system. Second, the Electoral College may be swayed by bias. Third, citizens do not really have control over their vote. The Electoral College system should be changed.

Many American citizens do not agree with the voting system. Citizens have grievances about the system being unfair and unreasonable. The Office of the Federal Register states, ""It's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality"" source 1. If American citizens are persistent with the issue, and continue to argue, then why is the government keeping the system? Why doesn't the government come up with a more rational voting system?

The Electoral College's vote may be swayed by bias. How can we trust total strangers with our vote? Bradford Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states source 2. Voters do not get the full effect of voting because they are voting for other ""qualified"" people to vote for them. How is that possibly effective?

Citizens do not have control over their vote. Once citizens vote their vote is out of their hands. The Electoral College chooses the president for them and there is nothing citizens can do about it. Bradford Plumer states, ""Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election"" source 2. The government has full control over how the election goes, not the citizens who voted.

The entire Electoral College system is completely irrational. The government needs to come up with a new way to vote for future presidents that is more fair. If we find a solution to this problem the government will not only gain favor of the American citizens, but also keep the balance that is established by the constitution. The American citizens will have control over their vote. The Electoral College should be abolished.",0,train_essays,,3
E40CC4AF740E,"Have you ever thought its time for change? Germany, New York , Columbia , and the United states are trying to reduce cars driven. Many benifits are coming from the downfall of cars being driven. Less stress, no smog from pollution, and less money spent on expensive cars.

Vauban's streets are completely car free. Heidrun Walter says she is less tense and much happier without a car. Walking, bycicling, and hyking are much more eco friendly. In 2006 a trend is growing in Europe. Vauban home to 5,500 residents may be the most expieriment in low car suburban life. Car ownership is allowed but there are few places to park large garages and the edge of development. 70 percent do not own cars and 57 percent sold cars to move to Vauban.

Car pollution is at its all time high, in paris motorists were ordered to leave their cars at home due to smog. 67 percent of vehicles in France use diesel fuel. Only 53.3 percent make up the rest of western europe. passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gases, and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states. Chicago to Shanghai people tend to make their homes which is a huge reduce of green house gas emissions from tailpipes.

Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years pass. Americas love for vehicles seems to be coolig down. The number of miles driven dropped in 2005 and continued droppimg steadily. In 2013 the number of miles driven was nearly 9 percent below its peak.

4F37F3579D51,"We have all been in a situation where our own solutions to problems may not be the most rational, and we often see ourselves turning to the people around us for the best advice. Whether its a minor situation, like what to wear on a special occasion, or major situations like what town would be the safest to move to. Whatever the situation is, how does seeking multiple opinions from different people help someone make a better choice? A few ways it can benefit you to seek multiple opinions is that different people can give you their own experiences and examples from their own lives, as well as help give you more options to help solve your issue, and can find you a more rational, mature response through the different people you seek advice from.

To start off, a benefit of seeking advice from multiple people was shown by Psychologist Generic_Name, at the University of Thomas Ridge who stated that: ""It has been shown that seeking advice and opinions from multiple people has often resulted that they too have had a similar situation, and are able to personally tell you how it had ended up, and what response they took that had either resulted in negative or positive consequences."" Basically, what this means is that seeking advice for more than one person can benefit you into finding a person who had been in a similar, if not the exact same, situation that you are in, and can give you efficient, accurate, first hand examples, or solutions to avoid the negative consequences all together.

Another reason, seeking multiple opinions on a situation can help you seek a better solution was shown by Psychologist Generic_Name, in the University of Washington Observers, claimed that: ""Seeking a solution to an issue should require more than one opinion. The reason I say this is that when dealing with major issues having a sense of choice is very important. Being limited of options causes a stress that there is really only one valid option. Discussing an issue with only one person can make you feel that way. Which is why seeking the opinion of multiple people can give you the courtesy of responding to that issue the best way you see fit with the opinions you have been given. What this basically means is that, seeking the opinion from a variety of different people can ensure that you have many solutions to work with. It can give you the satisfaction of being able to make a choice in your situation. Seeking multiple opinion can help you avoid the pressure that you are only allowed that one solution you have received.

To add on to that claim, an article called: Seeking Proper Advice. Member Generic_Name argued that when a problem or situation occurs it is best to seek more than one opinion. His reasoning for his claim is that the more people you ask for advice the more likely you're going to find somebody who is mature, and rational. As a result their response will most likely mirror their personality. Giving you mature and rational advice in your situation. He stated that this method is often showed as a recourse to receive nothing but the best advice. Most major problems arent an easy fix, but with a mature and rational response, it will surely make an impact on seeking the right path to your situation."" In other words, seeking the advice of¬†multiple¬†people can leave you exposed to a highly mature and rational person who will most likely give you a response that will not only¬†benefit¬†you, but give you the¬†opportunity¬†to¬†positively¬†turn a situation into a rational¬†solution.

To sum up, seeking the opinion of multiple people can help benefit you in many different ways such as opinions of those who have had situations that are similar to your own, a way to avoid the pressure of only having one opinion to turn to as a solution, and the opportunity to find an opinion that is both rational and mature. It is important to know the benefits of seeking the opinion of a variety of different people. I can ensure that there will be a time where you will need to seek a choice in an issue, and I only hope you turn to the people around you for their opinion, as a sense that it can truly benefit what path is taken to a positive¬†solution¬†with minor negative consequences.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,5

207B0FEB5BEF,"Extracurricular activities help prepare students for the real world, which is one of the major reasons students attend school. It should be mandatory for students to participate in extracurricular activities, because it would teach students time management, which is a life-skill needed in the real world. It also helps students discover their interests, and would encouraged young scholar to socialize with peers, who share common interests.

Firstly, extracurricular activities cause students to manage their time better. Students may have to balance their time between their social lives, extracurricular activities, the time they spend with family, school work, etc. Time management is essential for a successful live. For example, an individual is very intelligent, however, he/she starts their homework at a late hour, and does not have time to study for their mid-terms. As a result, that individual is very tired in the morning, and does not do as well as he/she could of on the test. Extracurricular activities would force students to manage their time better, by adding an extra layer of responsibility.

In addition, extracurricular activities would encourage students to socialize with peers that share common interest. With a large amount of stress that is put on young scholars, it is important for them to talk with individuals who are in the same position. Extracurricular actives would allow students to obtain that opportunity. Nevertheless, students can also learn from others, such as, their peers, mentors, and teachers. For example, an individual may be interested in sports. He/she has the opportunity to communicate with peers that also enjoy sports.

Furthermore, extracurricular activities aid students in discovering interests. For example, a young scholar participates in the school newspaper, that student may be interested in a profession where writing is involved, or maybe a student joins the school debate team, that student may enjoy a career in law. It is important for students to have an option when it comes to hobbies or interests, in order to be more successful. Extracurricular activities would provide that option. Extracurricular activities make it easier for students to find what they enjoy the most. This is an extremely important factor of school. A student may believe they enjoy a certain class, but when they join the class, they realize it is not for them. Extracurricular activities provide many doorways, in which students can enter or exit whenever they want.

In conclusion, making extracurricular activities mandatory would force students to manage their time better, expose students to peers that share common interests, and help young scholars discover their interests. Extracurricular activities are a part of the school experience, so students should jump on the bandwagon and discover what they enjoy.¬†   ¬† ¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,1

I think that you should change teh Electoral College because it isnt really fare to our state trhat congress gets to pick our president. we as a state shoul get to chose on who we want to run our country, and who we want to be our leader. we should not have to pick the electors, why can we be the electors ourselves?

In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

b8124f89,"Dear State Senator, Once a year, people all over the United States of America gather to vote for the most powerful men in the country our President and Vice President. We should have the people of America be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the Electoral College has some major flaws and simply because people have their rights. I believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choices.

The Electoral College has major flaws. Something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the people's decisions. Source A in paragraph 12 states, ""In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" The election is literally only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. It would be hard to believe that the people of the United States would want to be embarrassed because we can't even choose a presidential leader correctly. The other countries would take us as a joke we would simply look like fools. Another thing is, what would we do if there were a tie in the electoral vote. Source B also in paragraph 12 says, ""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" And with that being said, the election would be taken to the HOR House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. And because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing only 500,000 voters, would have much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million. That is the same population as Wyoming only times 70. That is a tremendous difference in population. Don't let our country plummet into bad election. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.

Ever since our founding fathers have settled here in America and made the Decloration of Independence in the late 1700s, the Amendments, and everything that gives us the right to be free, the people have had the right to vote. With the Electoral College, the people of America will not be able to freely use that right. Source C says, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have a chance of winning, focusing only on the right races in the ""swing"" states."" Seventeen states didn't even see the candidates during the campaign in 2000. Those states including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Voters in the 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see not one, not two, but zero campaign ads. Just as Source D states, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse."" The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and keep in mind that those electors possibly could defy the will of the people. What if a state sends two state of electors to Congress? It happened in 1960 with Hawaii and luckily VP Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent."" What if it happened again? Remember when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush? Thank that to the electoral college. In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes that George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. But why?

First of all, Source E states, ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small one does."" But the problem with this is is that it's simply unfair. The smaller states should get just as much attention as the bigger states do. This is like saying that on the baseball field, the bigger and stronger kids should be the ones picked first and be able to play but the smaller kids don't get to play. It is not fair to the people in the smaller states like Wyoming, to be considered not as good as the state of California. Also in paragraph 20 of Source F says, ""They are the most thoughtful voters, on average and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" Once again, this statement is unfair. This is favoritism. This is saying that the better and bigger states should get all the attention just because they are more ""thoughtful"". Once again, people deserve to have their rights so I say, let them vote.

People want to make their own decisions. It's who we are as a person we want to be able to have responsibilities we want to feel important. With the electoral college we won't be able to get that feeling because we feel we aren't important enough to vote. So it's official. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now and there's a pretty good reason. It's fair. There's only one thing I have to say to you. State Senator, please abolish the electoral college.",0,train_essays,,8
56B4E3A8FA68,"Teachers exclusivley should design summer assignments to apply tools and characteristcs nessicary to reveiw or learn in the upcoming year. This will not only educate students what they need to reivew, but also the new expectations and allow them a preveiw on the types of assignments the individual teacher assigns.¬†Summer asignments should be teacher designed to educate sutudents on what is to be expected in the following year.

Over the summer, students have a tendency to forget informantion they learned in the past year(s). Summer assignments allow for students to still have time off from school, but also insure they are still learning and not loosing information needed in their next school year. By making the project teacher designed, the educator can make sure the project is outlining previously taught tools, information, and possibly new skills they will need in their class in the fall; something that may potentially be missed or not fully appied if student design their own projects.

Expectations and types of assignments/projects vary from teacher and year. The purpose of summer assignments should be not only to make sure students are still learning and retaining information, but to also give the student a preveiw of the teachers teaching/assignment style, level of diffeculty of the class, and grading rubric. This way, it benifits the student in more way than one and completely prepares them for the class expectations of the following year. Therefore, it is essential the teacher themselves designs the project for the benifit of the student in all such elements.

Some may disagree that the individual student should design their own summer project because it insures the student is learning while getting some enjoment and individuality. However, if the students themselves design the project, it is not garanteed they will apply information and tools vital for next year. Even if they are given a rubric specifically outlining the nessicary elements needed within the project, the assignment will still be lacking an example of the types of projects the teacher is likely to assign in the future, the teachers educating style, and will not exibit the true difficulty of the class. The student will still be able to show their personality through their work within the teacher designed project, so it will still display individuality; but at the same time preparing them for the teachers class specifically.

Summer projects are helpful in the fact it assures students are still learning over break, but if exclusively the teacher designs it can similtaniously also be very helpful in outlining previously taught tools/ information they need in the following year, teacher and class expectaitions, as well as displaying both teacher and student personality. Summer asignments should be teacher designed to educate sutudents on what is to be expected in the following year.¬†   ¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3

German suburb, life goes on without cars, explains how many people have gone without a car and how they felt. In Paris when driving was banned, traffic went down 60%. Car free day was a big deal in Bogota, Colombia.

In germany, suburbs went on without cars and some had a positive affect and some had negative thoughts about it. Parking in streets driveways and garges were forbidden. If a car owner wanted to park they would have to buy a space for $40,000. Heidrun Walter, a mother and media trainer said "" When i had a car i was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Automobiles are a big deal or resource in the suburbs, but people who decided to not drive their cars, reduced greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions and up tp 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states, which is stated in paragraph 5. Ever since world war 2 everythings been centered around a car.¬† As a call of action, the enviromental protection agency is promoting "" car reduced"" communites.

Paris banned driving because of smog ? To reduce the amount of smog, paris banned cars from being driven and if driven you would have to pay a $31 fine! Not only did the smog reduce but also congestion reduced down to 60 percent in the capital of france. Warmer air trapped car emissions due to cold nights. When the smog cleared by monday, the ruling was removed.

In Bogota, Colombia cars had been bannd for 3 straight years. Millions of colombians hiked, biked,skated,walked, or took busses to wherever they wanted to go. The goal was to reduce smog and alternative transportation. Even when it rained, it didt effect people ad what they were doing. Two other colombian cities joined the no cars ruling. Even buisnees men like Carlos Artuto Plaza didnt use cars, but rode on a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion , Paraguay visited to see the action of no cars and quoted "" These people are generating a revolutionary change and this is crossing borders.""

E592D7734E3B,"Have you ever thought to yourself that perhaps your child could learn better at home than at school? Many children learn better at home than at school and there is many reasons why they do better at home than in school. Although some people believe that learning at school is a great idea because they get to work with other students, actually being home schooled would be better for any other student because they would concentrate better and learn differently.

Those who believe that their child could learn better at school have their reasons why such as, they would get to communicate with other students and get different opinions in certain subjects. Another reason could be, not only would they get help from a teacher, but they would also get help from other teachers and students who could explain certain things to them in a different way.

However, learning at home by a way of online classes or video conferencing could be better for any student currently attending a public or private school. Your child would most definitely concentrate better at home than at school. They would not have any sort of distraction while they are learning at home. For example, I have a friend who got injured¬†and could not attend school for almost 4 to 5 months. Therefore his parents decide to bring his education to his home. He was officially taking online classes at home for a good period of time and he said that, learning at home is way better than learning at school because you dont get distracted too easily and you concentrate better.

Also, taking online classes or video conferencing would be a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because they would be able to experience a different type of learning. They would only get a teacher to teach them all 4 subjects in a matter of hours and they would not have to take any electives. Once they are done with all their classes for the day, they would get to be home and rest or be on their phones/ laptops. For example, that same friend of mine who got injured; he would be taught or sometimes take a test and once he was done with everything, he would have the whole day to himself because he did not have any electives and did not have anything else to do.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why taking online classes or having a video conferencing is a better idea. Although some people believe that learning at school is a great idea because they get to work with other students, actually being home schooled would be better for any other student because they would concentrate better and learn differently.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
7F08C48D40F8,"Cars are one of the most important transportation in the world today. The reason the number of cars being sold is going down is because they are getting too expensive. Some people that do not have jobs are not able to afford getting a new car. There are people that have to sell their cars just so they can get a house to live in. Todays society does not have many cars because people have more technology today like cellphones and laptops. Several people that dont have a car either can't afford it, use a cellphone and walk places, or ride a bike places. Not everyone has the joy of driving a car so they don't bother trying to buy one. The newer cars are way over priced and noone is going to want to over pay for a vehicle. Ever since 2005 the amount of cars getting sold has been steadily dropping. When 2013 hit, the numbers of miles driven per person dropped 9% and was equal to the amount in 1995.

First, The percentage of people driving on the road went down because of the expense of the newer vehicles. The ones that were unemployed had no way of getting a new car because they did not work. Some people just did not have a good paying job to where they could be able to afford a new car. Every year more and more people loose their job so when they need a new car they will not be able to get one because they will have no money. Because of the expense of cars now the rate of ownership per household went down severely. The more the price the cars go up the lower the rate for people buying cars. Car dealerships are never going to sell any cars if they keep raising the prices.

Secondly, the people that have to sell their cars to buy a house should not have to do that. Everyone needs to have some kind of transportation but they cant with the prices of everything now a days. The prices should not be so high so people can afford to have a car for transportation and a home to live in. The world is not getting treated fairly especially the ones that are trying to get a job and noone will hire thems so they are not able to afford a car and a car payment. Noone should have to walk places to get anything because people make fun of them and there shouldn't be any judging. There are reasons the people without transportation have to walk and i believe that should change. The world should be better than what it is right now, there are so many disrespectful people in this world that think they are rich. People should never have to give up their vehicles or house for anything.

Finally, Todays society is going down because the prices shot up like a rocket these past few years. People are severely suffering because of them going up extremely quick and that should have never happened and i believe it needs to be fixed as fast as possible. The ones that are trying to get a job deserve to be able to afford a car but since noone wants to hire anyone they cant afford anything. Then, the ones selling their cars is not good they need to have a way of getting around especially if they have kids that needs to go to school or the doctors.

That is powerful. He is explaining that just because we do stuff here on Earth, or just because we find something out does not mean that we stop there. It means we strive and conquer our mission to do more, and here's why.

The scientists want samples, however, that would be very risky. Despite the risks, scientists would have to get up close and personal with Venus. They personally know that there are a lot of risks getting close to Venus. They mentioned that it could melt a spacecraft in a matter of a couple hours. However, they are determined. The author mentioned Venus had a lot of ""value"", he also stated, ""not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". This has meaning, and what it means is that not only do the scientists want to know about Venus and their ideas may lead to exploring Venus , but human curiosity will also take over and other people will want to know about Venus as well.

The scientists need this information to further the progression of learning and experimenting with Venus.

28B00BFB8BD3,"Dear principle,

I am writing this letter to tell you that i am against this new policy of at least having a B average to participate in any kind of sports. the reasons why is because kids need to have their fun. You shouldn't make that policy because you don't know if the kid will change once he is in sports. Sometimes a kid that does a lot of trouble and gets into sports changes because they don't concentrate on doing trouble. I'm going to explain my reason why this policy your doing is a wrong choice.

My first reason was that kids should have fun. Why? because they get tired of school.

Sometimes the teacher get on their nerves so they get into a sport were they can be relax and have fun without teacher making you do a lot of work and having to yell at you for stupid reasons. Sometimes its hard for i kid to do good in school when its boring. They have to be doing an activity and some classes are not like that so they fail it.

Second reason was that you shouldn't make it because after kids go into a sport they start to change. If you don't give them a chance then you will not know if they have a chance to change at all. When i was in a sport my grades started to change i started to come to school every day and i would always say to my self "" i better do good if not my cosh is going to find out and he is going to make me do a lot of running"". That's why you should give them a chance.

Last reason was that kid don't concentrate in doing any trouble when their in any type of sport. All kid concentrate is on doing good in your classes so they cant get in trouble in their sport. If their not in a sport they end up doing bad not caring about school and they just go to school for a waist of time. Instead let them have sport so it can be the other way around.

So principle please let us have sports, don't make the policy its unfair to some kids cuase they have trouble learning. I just want to say that if you read this i hope you change your mind. I really want kids to be able to play sport with low grades      ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
640899CC6EC5,"Should summer projects be student or teacher-designed?

Generic_City has some of the smartest and extremely qualified staff in the nation. The teachers in this county have degrees from some of the most prestigious universities in America. Teachers are always prepared to teach the curriculum to the best of their abilities.¬†Partially due to their efforts we have some of the highest

SAT

and exam scores in the nation. It would only make sense for teachers to design a project that they think would be beneficial to all new incoming students based on their experience through prior years. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers can base them around the their curriculum and needs of the upcoming class.

With teacher-designed summer projects teachers can give work they believe is most appropriate and beneficial for their curriculum during the school year. During the school year, the teacher is the individual who creates the worksheets and teaches the new course work, so who's better to prepare from than the source itself. Students taking that class should be prepared by having an overview of the new course work from the teacher. Teachers are familiar to the little basics most students forget coming into their class from previous years therefore, they incorporate the extra practice into the summer assignments and/or projects.

Teachers have a better insight on the students coming into their class the next year. Every class is different, a group of students may have a weakness in a certain unit that maybe the previous class didn't. Teachers can look at the previous year average grades of the new incoming class and tweak and adjust the projects based on the needs of the majority of incoming students. Teachers are able to talk to other teachers to get an insight on the students coming in during the fall and therefore, able to create a project or assignment that is most beneficial to all students.

Granted, there are times student-designed assignments are beneficial because sometimes teachers may not fully realize or understand the students need more preparation for a specific skill to thrive in their class. Alumni students can help by giving a better insight on the subjects that should be brushed up on. Although, this can be very beneficial to some students who learn a similar way, others may not have an issue with that specific topic or skill. It may be a strength for them and they would just be wasting their time on one specific skill when they could be working on a weakness of theirs. To avoid bias in summer assignments it is best to leave the assignments for teachers to create since they give more of an overview of the topics and generally don't go in depth on one specific skill but still prepare students enough to where they know what they'll be learning in their class.

Summer assignments should be teacher assigned to eliminate bias from students and receive work that is beneficial to all students. Teachers have connections with other staff members to make sure the incoming class is prepared and have all the basics down to thrive in their class during the new school year.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,0
E52ADC86DFFC,"The saying that ‚Äúfirst impressions are almost impossible to change‚Äù is one that often rings true in many situations. While the truth of this statement largely depends on the individual‚Äôs personality, experiences, and expectations regarding the particular person or situation they are encountering, it often holds true that a person‚Äôs initial impressions of something or someone can be hard to change. For example, if a person first sees another person they deem as unapproachable, unfriendly, or unkind, it may be quite difficult to convince them to give that person a second chance. This becomes especially true when the negative first impression is based on physical appearances, pre-existing prejudices, or any type of prior knowledge of the person/situation in question.  

On the other hand, there are also instances when first impressions are not necessarily set in stone and can be changed with deliberate effort and the willingness to look past one‚Äôs initial judgment. As humans, we are capable of recognizing our own biases and can learn to consider another‚Äôs opinion without jumping to conclusions. With the right attitude and a readiness to learn and understand, it is possible to modify one‚Äôs first impressions and develop a more accurate evaluation of the person or situation in question.

46E97FDCA469,"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" was a interesting factual article to read. My opion on driverless cars is they're not a good idea. I am against driverless cars. My reasons for this are an increasing rate of accidents, technology failing, and the cost. In the following paragraphs are reasons why I am against the ideal of driverless cars.

Starting off, my first reason for being against driverless cars was the increasing rate of accidents. Not all drivers pay attention to the road while driving (especially teens) and riding in a driverless car, coming into a situation that requires a human being to take control of the wheel can lead to accidents if they're not paying attention. The rates of car accidents are already high till this day, just imagine how high the rate would be having driverless cars. It may not even be the drivers fault, a glitch can happen with the car causing it to get into a accident injuring somebody, as said in passage 9; who's fault would it be then? The person or the manufacturers fault? That is my first reasoning opposing driverless cars.

Next, my second reason was the technology failing. We live in a society where technology advances EVERYDAY, but there is always a complications with technology. Updated technology isn't always perfect. For instence the computer system in the car could crash, shutting off the whole car, there might be a hay wire causing the car to spin out of control, causing an accident, and even a more dangerous situation the car could explode or catch on fire due to the technology. An example of today's most updated piece of technology that went bad is the ""Hoover Board,"" many people could just be riding on it, and it could burst into flames. The same thing could happen with driverless cars.

Lastly, my last reasoning was the cost put into the car. Many companies say they plan to have driverless cars by the year 2020, the amount of the Driverless Car would be a ridiculous amount of money. If someone were interested into buying it the first thing, they should ask themselves ""is it worth it?"" Knowing the bad outcomes that could possibly happen. Not only would the car be super expensive, but also having to fulfill the tank with gas, and gas nowadays isn't the cheapest. But the most important question asking yourself before buying the expensive piece of technology, is it really worth how much it costs?

In conclusion, I am against driverless cars. The reasons are, increasing rate of accidnets, technology failing, and the cost. I myself would not buy this knowing the reprecautions. That is why I am against the ideal of Driverless Cars.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Thus, causing a decrease in the amount of stress one inhabits, as well as a decrease in pollution, and beneficial effects on carbon emissions. The advantages of limiting car usage are increasing daily, and cutting your time spent driving may have a positive effect on not only your life but your families, and those surrounded by you.

Traveling across the world to Germany, you will find Vauban. A well-known, upscale community where more and more soccer moms and commuting executives are giving up their cars. This experimental, new district has generally forebidden street parking, driveways, and home garages. Therefore seventy percent of the residents in this community do not have cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move to this ecofriendly habitat. One resident, Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car, I was always tense, I'm much happier now."" The atomosphere of this residence has a positive effect on stress, meaning it decreases it! The vibe of walking down a street filled with the swish of bicycles passing by, and the chatter of wandering children has lowered the stress of nearly all residents. This ecofriendly, and stress-free enviroment is a trend that is growing and being adopted by many countries, including the U.S. From Chicago to Shanghai, this residential area may be the place for you.

Paris, France, home to the famous Eiffel Tower even has its pollution problems. After days of uncontrollable smog, the ruling French party enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of thiis well-known city. They ruled that on Monday's even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their vehicles at home, and on Tuesdays, odd-numbered license plates were to do so as well. After this first trial, the congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France. This was a huge success since Paris typically has more pollution that other European capitals. Temporary laws like this have a huge effect on reducing the amount of pollution in crowded cities. Even the city of love has unclean air, how romantic is that? Limiting the usage of cars benefited this society immensely, and it could benefit our world as a whole if all of us chose to cut back our car usage at least twice a week.

Automobiles are the Beyonce of suburbs, where families from California all the way to Sydney tend to make their homes. Experts have concluded that this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes all around the world. Passenger cars in Europe are only responsible for twelve percent of these emissions, while America is responsible for up to fifty percent. President Obama's goals to drastically curb these greenhouse gas emissions will be assisted by a shift in American behavior: Fewer Americans getting their license. Studies have shown less and less of Americas youth are prioritizing getting their license. If this pattern persists, it will have a beneficial effect on the reduction of carbon emissions being released into the environment. This calls for less pollution, and a more ecofriendly, healthy society for us all.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in your daily life can cause a drastic change. These changes include a decrease in the amount of stress one inhabits, to less pollution, and a beneficial effect on carbon emissions. Our society as a whole has the opportunity to reduce car usage, so why not grab it while we have the chance. A healthier environment calls for a healthier you.    ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

That's why I'm agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, we live in a world the people don't like when you are yourself and they like when you are someone else; I don't think the accomplishment is just for be someone else and not yourself, if you try hard when you are yourself you will have the greatest accomplisment in life and for people who don't belived in their self like: Family, company, manager,people, and you; If you belived in yourself everthing will be good and the accomplishment would be often.",0,original_moth,"Task:

D30D6D7F3D39,"Some teachers think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. I feel that working together would be more helpful for all students because they can share more ideas, have less work and can be working with less stress.

Students can have a little conversation for get more information, then they can pick one or more ideas for make their work more easy . They can argue from each idea that could be more important. Every students have different thoughts that can help them to realize a good work. For example, When I was in my country my teacher said that we can choose work together or alone, and I prefer to work alone because I thought that working alone was more beneficial for me but I was really confused about it. Working together help us to know different option and students can have more social communication.

Working together imply to have less work. Students can be take more opportunities for learn new thing everyday, also that can help teachers too. Less work can be helpful for a lot students because they can realize missing work, extra work and other activities during class. Furthermore, I remember when I was in 6 grade my teacher said that ''less work can help you to have more time for you'' that means that sometimes with less work teachers and students could learn and have more progress.

Some classes can be stressful for a many students because teachers need to realize all activities during their classes and sometime students do not understand what they need to do. Otherwise, working together would be more easy for students to finish their work quickly. One important fact in my life that

I never forgot is when my English teacher said that we have just 10 minutes for take the exam, and everyone fail because he was very strict with us. Working with another person have a lot benefits for reduce stress. Students can help each other and check their own work .

In conclusion, Working together could be very helpful for many students who need help for get better grades during the year.

Even thought a b average is a way to bring up kids grades it still may leave kids out of school activities and other things of that sort. I strongly feel that kids should be encouraged to try new things and by changing the standard it could take all that away. I also think it may make some kids feel like there not good enough to take more challenging classes and that may lead in more kids taking lower classes.

I really think you should take your time on this because it could affect many students, that strive to try hard but come out a little short of there goals.

llama_70b_v1328,"Introduction:

Hey there! Have you ever imagined a world where cars can drive themselves? Like, literally, no human input needed? It's like having your own personal chauffeur, but without the fancy suit and top hat. Well, that world might not be too far away, my friends. Driverless cars are coming, and they're gonna change everything! But, should we be excited or worried? In this essay, I'll argue for the development of driverless cars, using some pretty cool details from an article I read.

Body:

First off, let's talk about the good stuff. According to the article, driverless cars can reduce the number of accidents on the road. Can you believe that over 90% of car crashes are caused by human error? Yikes! That's a lot of mistakes. But, with driverless cars, we can avoid all those silly mistakes and save lives. Plus, think about how much time we'll save! No more traffic jams, no more parking nightmares, no more road rage. It'll be like having your own personal highway, with no one to honk at you (except maybe a few angry birds, but hey, they're just trying to live their best bird lives).

Now, some people might say, ""But what about job loss? All those drivers won't have jobs anymore!"" And, yeah, that's a valid concern. But, here's the thing: driverless cars will create new jobs too! Like, have you heard of ""driverless car technicians""? They're the cool kids who get to fix and maintain these fancy cars. And, let's not forget about all the software developers and engineers who'll be needed to make sure these cars run smoothly. It's like a whole new industry, just waiting to be explored!

Conclusion:

So, there you have it. Driverless cars might just be the future we've been waiting for. They're gonna save lives, save time, and create new jobs. And, let's be real, who wouldn't want their own personal chauffeur? I mean, without the fancy suit and top hat, of course. But, seriously, folks, driverless cars are the way to go. Let's embrace the future and make it a safe, efficient, and job-creating one!

Oh, and by the way, did I mention that driverless cars can also help the environment? They can run on electricity and reduce our carbon footprint. It's like having a personal eco-friendly chauffeur! How cool is that?",1,llama_70b_v1,"In the article ‚ÄúDriverless Cars are Coming,‚Äù the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

So, you know how people are like, totally different from each other? Like, some are really outgoing and social, while others are more reserved and introverted? That's because of their character traits! And, duh, we all know that having good character traits is TOTALLY important. Like, it can make or break you in life.

First of all, let's talk about how having good character traits can help you make friends and stuff. If you're nice and kind to people, they're way more likely to want to hang out with you and be your friend. And, like, who doesn't want more friends, right? It's like, the more friends you have, the more fun you can have and the less bored you'll be. Plus, if you're nice to people, they're way more likely to be nice to you too. It's like, a total win-win situation!

But, like, choosing the right character traits isn't always easy. Sometimes, it can be hard to know what traits are good to have and which ones to avoid. For example, if you're too bossy and controlling, people might not want to be around you as much. And, like, who wants to be that person? Not me, for sure! But, if you're too lazy and don't want to do anything, people might not think you're very reliable or trustworthy. So, it's important to find a balance and be, like, a nice mix of different traits.

Another thing that's cool about character traits is that they can help you figure out what you want to do in life. Like, if you're really outgoing and love being around people, you might want to be a teacher or a performer or something. And, if you're more reserved and like to have time to yourself, you might want to be a writer or an artist. It's like, your character traits can help you figure out what you're good at and what you want to do with your life.

It is common for schools to have programs that combine students of different ages, but research has shown that these programs can have a negative effect on student learning. The differences in knowledge levels between older and younger students can impede education in several ways.

Firstly, older students may struggle to keep up with the pace of younger students, who may have a better understanding of the material. This can lead to frustration and disengagement, which can negatively impact their learning. Additionally, younger students may become bored with the material and lose interest, which can also hinder their learning.

To address this challenge, teachers can use a variety of methods to differentiate instruction for students of different ages. This can include providing additional support for older students, such as extra practice or additional resources, and providing more challenging tasks for younger students. Teachers can also use group work and peer teaching to facilitate learning and engagement.

The experiences of a student described in the essay can differ from other similar programs in several ways. For example, the student may have been in a program that was specifically designed for students of different ages, which may have provided more support and resources for older students. Additionally, the student may have been in a program that was more structured and focused on specific learning objectives, which may have helped to keep all students engaged and motivated.

When comparing the advantages and disadvantages of programs with older and younger students, it is important to consider the unique needs and characteristics of each group. On one hand, programs with older and younger students can provide opportunities for intergenerational learning and collaboration, which can enhance student engagement and motivation. On the other hand, the differences in knowledge levels can impede education and lead to frustration and disengagement.

In conclusion, while programs with older and younger students can have some advantages, research has shown that they can also have a negative impact on student learning. To address this challenge, teachers can use a variety of methods to differentiate instruction and facilitate learning and engagement.

I think that community service would be an excellent way of using time. It would be good for me to start with the classics and pick up the garbage off of the ground that nature has given us, basically because it is the only one I know about. It would be a wise choice of time to help the community, and Earth by picking the litter that some people carelessly throw on the ground. Spending time to help the Earth does not bother me a single bit, as long as it is not too wet outside. Many students that would be enthusiastic to give assistance would be glorious, but it is not fair for others to do it if they don't want to. I can understand if they want to stay at the comfort of their own home, and I don't really expect many people would do community service to use their ""valuable"" time. In my own opinion though, I think that students all over the world should do this at least thirty minutes a day or week, it's what you choose, but that is only me. I would not mind on how any of my friends would think about me, it is how they should feel about not helping the planet they live on, or even one of their friends. Also TEACHER_NAME, I think you should give the students that do community service some extra credit on their grades, which brings me back to what I said earlier, they should not do it if they do not want to, they just wont get the extra credit.

63765DD9525D,"The Electoral College was created with good intentions, but it has many vital flaws which allow for very unfair outcomes. The electoral college is an outdated, and irrational way to choose the president of our country for the next four years. It allows for silly tricks to be played - you can win the presidency with a mere fourty percent of the country in support of you. You can completely ignore some of your voters, as you're guaranteed to either win or lose heavily biased states, and you can gain massive numbers of electoral votes due to one more vote for a side in a state count. The system even allows for massive corruption to go unpunished, which is one of the biggest offenses in our country.

The electoral college's biggest flaw may perhaps be its ability to elect a president that doesn't even appeal to half of the country. According to source two, Al Gore ""won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" Al Gore had a signifigant victory in popular vote for the nation, yet still was denied presidency due to the electoral college's vote assignment system. If we did away with the electoral college, each and every person would have an equal say, and would be equally important to the candidates.¬† Even source three agrees that the trust in our electors is occasionally betrayed, albiet rarely.

Currently, the candidates can completely ignore portions of our country. Republicans have a strongly biased voter base in the south - so much so that generally speaking, the Republicans never have a single rally or major ad. According source two, states like South Carolina almost never vote Democrat. It's so rare, that if you lost, you offended the group that has voted unquestioningly for your party since the system has been put into place. If the electoral college system didn't exist, the thirty percent of southern Democrats would have a say, which would make advertising and campaigning all over the country much more vital.

The electoral college system also allows for an astonishing amount of corruption with no punishment. If a state manages to vote one hundred percent Democrat, rogue electors can still cast their vote for the Republican candidate - and this isn't against the rules. We're essentially putting the next four years of our country into the hands of 538 electors, and holding them to the lowest possible degree of accountability. Again, source three clearly states ""and that trust is rarely betrayed."" While it's rare, it's still more than possible, and can be quite disasterous.

Some may argue that the electoral college system puts into place a system of certainty and safety, for both the candidates and the people. This, however, is quite far from the truth. According to source three, ""the residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised."" While this source claims that ignoring biased parts of the population, this is quite far from the truth. People are being entirely ignored by the powerful politicians that are supposed to represent them. That doesn't sound very democratic and fair to me. People begin to feel discouraged and that their vote doesn't count, and this is quite close to the being the case. Only one-half of elligable citizens voted in the 2012 election, which means that one half didn't. Half of our country isn't bothering to vote in the elections because the electoral college system completely negates their vote.

Our country prides itself on being ""the land of the free, and the home of the brave,"" yet our people are being discouraged at every turn by our government. The popular opinion of our people is that the government is out to get us, and there's not much evidence to contradict that. The electoral college system allows for the government to be run by men who didn't fairly win over our country, and isn't accurately representing our views. It's rife with corruption, and allows money to buy power. If we remove this system in favor of a popular vote election would encourage more popular policy, make our government closer to the people, and have little to no negative impact on our country.

I have to say that ,I myself an 8th grader disagree, on your new school policy.

For the fact that , having a ""C"" average is better than an ""F"" average? Sports have influenced me the most, throughout the school year to keep my grades up. Our coaches here at SCHOOL_NAME, have kept the athletes informed, of some important information. Meaning in order to be an athlete , your grades have to be 75 or above.

If we do not meet the requirements we must not play in a game or also have some type of punishment, meaning running extra etc. . Being an athlete is very difficult. In my opinion I think, what the coaches are doing is fine. To change the school policy, i' m positive we would not exactly have a full team , 75 or above rule helps us all out.

My parents have always, told me in order to not be punished to bring home at least a 75 or up. I've been ""A"" , ""B"" honor roll, since kinder.

Imagine walking out into a world of smoke, dust, and fog; finding oranisms exstinct or hiding. This is a glimspe of our future. If we do not conrol car usage in our days today this is what it will come to. Limiting car usage has a plethora of advantages.

In Vauban, Germany, past car owners have given up their veihicles for a better life. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' sad Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the clatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.""(

""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars""

by Elizabeth Rosenthal Paragraph 3 Lines 20 through 25). Many people have given up their cars and homes to move to this upscale communtity. It is an example of a trend to separate suburban life and auto use.

There are efforts going on right now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Twelve percent of those emissions are from passenger cars and up to fifty percent in car-intensive areas in the United States.

According to the article

""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog""

, Paris, France has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of a near-record pollution. People who were motorists or drove licensed cars were ordered to not drive or they were to pay a fine of $31(22-euro fine). This did not stop most of the people however, because four thousand drivers were find, and 27 of them had their cars impounded for how they reacted upon this.

Paris typically has more smog. Having limited car usage enabled the congestion(car traffic) to go down 60 percent in Paris. Even though after this enforcement of the driving ban made delivery companies coplain of lost revenue, there were agreements for hybrids and cars carrying three or more passangers.

Imagine walking outside to the fresh air while feeling a rose petal on a near-by bush and watching a squirell and blue jay up in the trees. The neighbors are getting on their bike to the lake across town. All is happy and clean. This was due to limiting car usage in not just Paris and Vauban, but everywhere.       ¬†       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8

743904BAD7E5,"Distractive driving

Two seconds is all it takes to risk the lives of the driver and people on the road. For the driver to take their eyes and brain off the task of driving is highly dangerous. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because they are putting their safety and others endangered and risk rising insurance prices.

Multitasking and using a mobile phone while behind the wheel is distracting to the driver, which can be life-threatening. Distractive driving effects all drivers equally whether the driver is talking on the phone, texting, on social media, or taking photos. For example, Emily wrote, ""Unfortunately, more and more people are making the dangerous decision to text and drive, which causes 1.6 million crashes and almost 400,000 injuries per year, according to The National Safety Council-that's one out of every four car accidents!""(Delbridge) In other words, studies found that operating a mobile phone while driving slows the reaction time of the driver, and restricts a driver's perception skills; which increases the likelihoods of being involved in a collision. Distractive driving is equivalent to drunk driving because the behavior causes negative consequences that are life threatening. Especially for inexperience drivers and those who lack skill. To add on, the ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"" states, ""In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States."" (Distracted Driving Research)

All driver should know that if they cause an accident because of risky behavior, their car insurance rate will certainly increase. It is important to know because the bad behavior of distractive driving can have an impact on other drivers too. For instance, Emily's article states, ""Because of this, car accident rates have risen over 14 percent since 2014. Not only does this make driving more dangerous for everyone, but it also contributes to increased car insurance premiums for everyone."" (Delbridge) The car insurance premiums are established by many different components, including the drivers' neighborhood, age, distance of commute, driving history, and the behavior of other drivers. The last category is why texting and driving effects everyone. Those who tend to use their cellphone while driving is the reason that the annual U.S. traffic fatalities are rise with insurance claims.

Drivers should not use their mobile phone in any way while operating any motorize vehicle. If there is any need to use the cellphone for emergencies, the GPS, or music, Please, pullover or do it before you start to proceed driving.

In conclusion drivers need to drive and only drive because whatever it is that is distracting is not worth people's lives.

C5113BD6EDBF,"Most schools will assign summer assignments that give students a preview of what their upcoming year will be like in certain classes. This also helps teachers because they won't be teaching a new topic to a bunch of students who have no previous knowledge on the subject. Having summer assignments allows students to have a foot in the door for a new class. These projects would be considered, ""teacher-designed"". An example of a teacher-based assignment would be assigning students to look into a concept they will be learning that year in the class; if you are going into Chemistry, you might be assigned to memorize the periodic table over the summer. I believe that summer projects should be student-designed in a way that students have the opportunity to refresh themselves on things they've learned in the past or just a few simple problems or equations a day to keep the brain active. Student-designed projects would be more beneficial to students for many reasons; they won't be as stressed out to learn a new topic by themselves, they will have the opportunity to refine past skills, and it won't ruin their summer break.

Most students in high school have a lot of pressure on them to get good grades, be involved, and stay out of trouble. Whether it be parents, friends, or teachers, every high school student feels stress. Summer break allows students to relax, hang out with friends, and give their brains a break. By assigning summer projects that involve learning a completely foreign topic, the stress of school is reignited and takes that break away from the students. Although assigning these types of projects would be beneficial to the teacher,

I believe it is wrong to make students feel more stressed than they already are just so the teacher can catch a break. For example, when I was in 7th grade I took Pre-Algebra. I remember it was a pretty hard year for me and I was so happy when it was over so I could relax over the summer. On the last day of school my teacher handed my a book titled, ""Algebra 1, the basics"". We had to complete an entire booklet on a math class that we had almost no knowledge about. I spent hours and hours over that summer trying to teach myself Algebra 1 just so my teacher wouldn't have to. This is just more work that causes unneccessry stress in students already busy lives.

Assigning student-based summer assignments would actually be more beneficial to both teachers and students than you'd think. Most classes build on classes that you've had in the past, for example Spanish 2 builds off of the things you learned in Spanish 1. Students are constantly learning new things and gaining new experiences. When you're constantly learning and growing, it can be easy to forget what youve done in the past. Due to this, classes usually begin the year by re-teaching things from previous years. For example, if you took Algebra 1 as a freshman and Algebra 2 as a junior, you would need to review some of those concepts you learned in Algebra 1 to be successful in Algebra 2. If this review work is assigned over summer, students will be able to go into Algebra 2 more prepared and it would save the class a lot of time. The time that would normally be spent on review from previous years could be spread out throughout the year and allow the teacher to spend more time on different units. This would allow the students to feel less stressed about learning a topic in a short amount of time.

Speaking of short amount of time, the summer is the 2 months a year that students can wake up every morning and not have to worry about pressing due dates, homework, studying for tests, or anything school related. I wish I could say that there shouldn't be summer assignments at all. However, I recognize they're important for success and are beneficial to us as students. Assigning student-based assignments are short and easy refreshers for students. I would have no problem waking up every day and doing a couple math problems from a concept I previously learned. Once you get going on a topic you once knew, it all comes back to you and the work should be easy. This is much less stressful than trying to teach yourself for a class you have in the upcoming year. This past summer I was given a summer assignment for my AP Lang class. We were tasked with writing 15 papers about different topics that we chose (with one topic per paper). Each page had to written in a specific format called, ""precis"". We were never taught about this format of writing so it made completing the summer assignment extremely difficult. After about 20 hours of work I was finished with the project. As a freshman I was given a summer assignment for my English class that simply tasked us with reading a book. Every day I would go outside, lay down, and read 30 pages of the book. It was a completely stress free experience that kept my mind active over the summer. I find that these summer assignments are far more helpful for students and their mental health.

Most students will say that summer assignments are useless and aren't beneficial to anyone. I disagree and can argue that anyone who completes the assignment is benefiting from it. By doing nothing over the summer, you are setting yourself up for a rude awakening come August 24. Summer assignments should simply be used to keep our minds in a ""school mode"" without us really knowing. There should no serious work or stress involved. That is why I believe that student-based summer assignments are more beneficial than teacher-base assignments. After all, the teachers are the ones being paid to teach, not the students.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

BF01FFEF8CB3,"When you ask for advice, you ask multiple people right? I do. One of the reasons why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because when you ask more than one people for advice, they mostly give you different ideas and the more ideas you get from people the easier it feels to make that choice. Another reason why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is that when you ask different people for advice they would give you their own opinions about that choice. For example, if you ask your friend for advice for a choice you are going to make, that friend might tell you something positive about it, in the other hand, if you ask another friend for advice for a choice they might tell you something bad about it which will be way different than what your other friend said. The third reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if one person told you a negative advise and the other person told you a positive advise, you could pick which one you think is helpful. The fourth reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if you ask a friend for advice they can tell you their personal thoughts about that choice and if you ask another person they might give you their personal thoughts about it. For example, if you ask a friend to tell you if you should do your homework or not that friend might say ""No dont do your homework and lets hang out"" ,in the other hand, if you ask your other friend if you should do your homework or not he might say ""Yes do your homework because if you dont you might get a bad grade"", and then you would have to pick which one is better for you. To conclude, if you realy need advice, you should ask multiple people so then you could get more ideas.",0,original_moth,Task: Write an essay discussing the advantages of seeking multiple options when making a decision.,1

I think you should allow students to bring phones to school to use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I believe they should do this because if there not doing anything the students using there cell phones isn't going to hurt them. Especially at lunch when there eating or having conversations they should be able to use there phone its not harming themselves or others . Maybe they need to talk to a parent or something serious letting them use there phone would be great just as long as they don't use it in class. They could have family emergency's and everything and them having a phone would be pleasant. Them having it in class is not really bad at all especially when they have teachers watching them a lot im sure they cant call or text anyone while there in the classroom trying to learn. I'm also sure if a student wanted to text in class they could if you tell them not to bring there phone there going to do it anyway no matter what the teacher says.

ff5a6fd6,"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages, both for individuals and for the environment. The passages provided highlight the benefits of car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days, all of which contribute to a more sustainable and efficient future.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and work towards a cleaner and healthier environment.

Car-free communities, such as Vauban in Germany, offer a model for a more sustainable way of living. These communities prioritize walking, cycling, and public transportation, and discourage car ownership. The passage states that 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. The residents of Vauban have experienced improved quality of life and reduced stress levels without cars. This suggests that limiting car usage can lead to a more peaceful and enjoyable community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. The passages highlight how driving bans, such as the one implemented in Paris, can significantly reduce congestion. In Paris, congestion decreased by 60 percent after the ban was enforced. This reduction in traffic congestion not only improves air quality but also saves time for commuters. With fewer cars on the road, public transportation becomes more efficient, allowing for faster travel times and a smoother flow of traffic.

In addition to these benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to healthier and more active communities. Car-free days, such as the one in Bogota, Colombia, encourage people to walk, bike, or use public transportation. These alternative modes of transportation promote physical activity, which is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The passage mentions how millions of Colombians participated in the car-free day and left the streets devoid of traffic jams. This shows that there is a willingness among people to embrace alternative modes of transportation and prioritize their health.

Overall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved quality of life, reduced traffic congestion, and healthier communities. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the success and feasibility of implementing car-free initiatives. As a society, it is important to prioritize sustainable transportation options and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars.",1,radek_500,,2
17E5C17F1A9F,"First of all, what is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process, not a place. This process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. It consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 is requited to elect the President.

In other words, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. And that`s what`s wrong with the Electoral Project system.

For example: If you live in Texas, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you`d not vote for this candidate, but for a slate of 34 Democratica electors pledged to John Kerry. But who are these electors? Who picks the electors in the first place? Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always

The electoral College is unfair and irrational. Voters don`t want to vote for a bunch of strange people. The voters in fact, wanto to vote for someone who they had chose. We son`t want to put our decision on someone else`s hand, we want to be in control of our own vote.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
D1A0AFC80A9A,"Title: The Power of Character Traits: Shaping Our Lives and Inspiring Others

As an 8th grader, I have learned that character traits are essential for personal growth and development. Through research and exploration, I have discovered why certain traits are important, how they are shaped by environment, upbringing, and personal experiences, and how influential people have inspired the development of these traits. I will examine the differences in how kids and adults approach developing character traits and analyze the consequences of choosing certain traits.

Character traits are the qualities that define who we are as individuals. They can be good or bad, and they shape our interactions with others and our experiences in life. For instance, having empathy and kindness can make us more compassionate and understanding towards others, while being brave and resilient can help us overcome challenges and obstacles. Research has shown that these traits are shaped by our environment, upbringing, and personal experiences. For example, someone who has grown up in a nurturing and supportive environment is more likely to develop empathy and kindness, while someone who has faced adversity and challenges may develop resilience and determination.

Influential people throughout history have also inspired the development of certain character traits. For instance, Nelson Mandela's perseverance and dedication to fighting against injustice have inspired many to stand up for what they believe in and fight for what is right. Similarly, Malala Yousafzai's courage and determination in the face of adversity have inspired many to speak out against injustice and fight for the rights of others. These individuals have shown us that with hard work and determination, we can develop character traits that can help us make a positive impact on the world.

However, kids and adults differ in their approach to developing character traits. Children are still learning and developing their traits, and they may need more guidance and support from adults. Adults, on the other hand, may have a more established set of traits and may be more focused on refining and improving them. Additionally, adults may be more aware of the consequences of choosing certain character traits, and they may be more motivated to develop traits that will help",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

1B95C44855DD,"Forcing students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is an unnecessary decision. In my opinion, I believe that you should only join an activity if you want to. I also believe that extracurricular activities are meant to be completely optional. You shouldn't be forced to do something that you have no interest in doing. Some of the activities may not interest students at all and we want them to have fun, not be extremely bored because they were forced to join an activity. I disagree with the decision to force all students to participate in at least one of the activities because some students don't want to join one, others might not be able to join, and some have things to do outside of school.

First, some students don't want to participate at all. I wouldn't make them have to do something they have no interest in doing at all. For example, some could care less about playing a sport. They could also probably not care at all about joining a club, or to work on the school yearbook.

Next, some students might not be able to participate in an activity. They could be busy with something. They might not have the time to join one or some of the activities. That is the second reason why I disagree with my principal's decision to enforce students to participate in at least one activity.

Lastly, some students have things to do outside of school. They might not be able to stay back after school for one of the activities. Things like having to watch and take care of your sibling, having to go somewhere are some examples of why students wouldn't have the time to participate. They wouldn't be able to focus on things like sports, clubs, etc.

Now some may disagree and say that it's a good idea to make students join an activity but there are some pros and cons. Sure students would be learning more things but I believe that half the people there would be the ones who were forced to join in the first place. There are some benefits to being in an extracurricular activity but i don't think it should be enforced.

That is why I disagree with my principal's decision. Activities shouldn't be mandatory but just an option if you want to try something new out. I hope Generic_Name revokes this decision so we're not forced into something we don't want to do. In conclusion, I don't agree with Generic_Name's decision because some students don't want to join one, aren't able to participate, and some have things to do after and outside of school.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

All Americans do is drive everywhere,they never think about how driving effects the air and the temperature of this planet. Maybe we can be like Africa and have nothing at all. Or just maybe appreciate that we actually have something. Why would we ever get rid of cars? I do not know,but i do know that getting rid of cars is really stupid. Well as i was asked im now going to explain to you how getting rid of cars is ""good"".

One reason why getting rid of cars could be good is that you wont have to really worry about the greenhouse gases that are emmited by the exhaust pipes. Your air will be as clean as a whistle. The only thing bad about that is that those gases actually keep some places warm,but to other people it justs ""melts the ice caps."".

Another reason why getting rid of cars is good is that there will be less traffic and fewer accidents. So you'll get to work a little bit later than usual but you'll get there safe. You wont have to worry about about spending thousands of dollars every time you need a new ride,just a couple of hundreds. People rarely get their licences anyways so it doesnt really matter.

B8CA9E3E3100,"You have a math homework assignment that you don't know how to do, or you need advice in a relationship, or you need feedback on how to get better at a sport. You want to improve in something or solve a problem but you just don't know how to execute this issue. In that case you might ask for someone's help on how to do things. But be careful who you ask. If you ask the wrong person, then they can give you the wrong answer and then give you the outcome that you don't want. That's why it is important to ask multiple people if you want to get advice and have a great outcome of what you do.

Just because they are your friend does not mean they are the right person to ask. Asking the wrong person can increase the probability of you making the wrong choice. Bad people don't really see other people's view of life or what other people think because they only care about themselves. Getting advice from those type of people is not good because if you continue to get advice from these type of people then you end up being a bad person yourself because you get into a habit of doing the same acts that those bad people do. The wrong person to ask however is not always a bad person.

Asking the right person however, will help you get a better outcome. A person who can see the bigger picture or someone who is very well experienced is a great person to ask. What I mean by someone who is well experienced is for example, let's say your a swimmer. Your a very good swimmer but you want to improve and get faster. would you rather get advice from someone who doesn't know how to swim or would you get advice from Michael Phelps, an Olympic swimmer legend.

The reason why you should get multiple people's advice and opinion's is so that you all the possible ways you execute something. For example you get advice on how to swim butterfly from Michael Phelps and Caleb Dressel, another great swimmer who actually recently broke Michael Phelps's world record. Everyone has there own little trick or way they swim, Michael and Caleb did not learn the same way as each other. If you get the advice of both of them on how to swim butterfly you could the pros and cons on there different ways of swimming and make a hybrid on how to swim butterfly faster. Living with just one person's opinion is never good.

And this idea started hundreds of years ago. That's why we have the Constitution and a democracy, so everyone has a say in America and there opinion is always valid.

B617FC07CCB6,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Sports are very important to many of our students but academics is far more important than any sport. Students need to learn to push themselves harder if they want the privilege of playing sports. Students should not be allowed to accept the minimum. The students are our next generation they need to learn how to be pushed. i am all for your change from a ""c"" average to a ""b"" average.

The athletes at our school are very talented athletically and academically but when it comes to academics they tend to slack. Athletes feel as though because they are captain of their basketball team or made the varsity football team they are on top so they don't need to try when it comes to academics...well they thought wrong. The academic average of a ""c"" for an athlete is way too low. Just how athletes are pushed when it comes the their sports, they should be pushed in academics as well. Letting athletes have a ""c"" average is saying you don't have to try because you'll make it anyways. When in fact that is not true. Athletes need to learn that if you push yourself in school you can make it just about anywhere.

Athletes aren't allowed just to do the minimum on the field or on the court so why should they be allowed to do the minimum in classrooms. Coaches tell their players to always give one-hundred and ten percent every time they go to play a game. If they do that there then why not in the classrooms?

Now one might say that not all athletes just sit back. Well I understand that. I do know that there are a handful of athletes who actually try their hardest to do well, so they might think that this isn't fair when in fact it is only helping them to do better and keep trying. You are not going to be the star of every game that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play right? Same way in the class, you are not always going to be the star student but you keep on trying until you are. Same as you do when you go to practice.

Now stop Worrying about what the slackers say because you are only helping them.

B6D958C73D90,"Hey, so I know some schools have been trying out this four-day workweek thing, but I think it's a bad idea for our school to adopt it. I mean, sure, it might seem cool to have more time off, but there are some serious problems with it.

First of all, let's talk about energy conservation. If we have a shorter week, we're gonna use more energy on school days. It's just simple math. We'd be using the same amount of energy, but spread out over more days. That's not exactly gonna help the environment, you know? And let's be real, climate change is a big deal, and we should be doing everything we can to reduce our carbon footprint.

But it's not just about energy conservation. Having an extended school day is also gonna be tough on families. A lot of parents have to work during the day, and it's gonna be hard for them to balance work and family responsibilities with an extra hour in school. Plus, it's not like we're gonna be learning any more stuff during that extra hour. I mean, I know some teachers might try to cram more stuff in, but let's be real, they're not gonna be able to cover any more material in that extra hour. So it's just gonna be a waste of time.

And don't even get me started on the impact it'll have on extracurriculars. Sports, clubs, and other activities are already cut short because of the school day, and adding an extra hour isn't gonna make things any better. Kids need time to relax and have fun outside of school, and an extended school day just takes that away from them.

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But what about the benefits of having more time in school?"" And I get that, but it's not like we're gonna be learning any more stuff during that extra hour. And even if we were, it's not like it's gonna make a big difference in the long run. I mean, I've been in school for eight years now, and I can tell you that the stuff I've learned in school hasn't exactly been life-changing.

I truly believe it would benefit a students daily life at school if they could use there cell phones during there free time. In this letter i will expand on this idea and why I believe that it is true. Hopefully you will consider it.

First of all i believe that with cell phones at lunch or break would prevent students from being tempted to take them out in class. With there phones out during there free time they will students could be more social with other students teaching them a valuable life lesson. Because students will be able to use them during free time, they will feel as though they do not have to use them during class time. Saving both the teacher and the students some trouble.

Also, i believe that it would benefit the noise level. Being able to use phones at lunch or other free periods would take more attention off of talking and more on texting or other applications that a cell phone has.

With all of the noise gone from the lunchroom or break area teachers could get more done with the day then waiting around looking to get people into trouble. Lastly of this idea every day i see teachers complaining that, a students phone went off in class, well if we could use them during free time maybe that wouldn't happen.

Finally, i will say that with cell phones there could also be better working conditions for teachers as well as students. With cell phones, teacher would be able to use that as a work device they could save time, they could be used to call an important person or a speaker to talk to there class, and teachers will be able to do work that would be unavailable to them on a computer .

When our great leaders died they're visions didn't die. They wanted the people to be in charge of who runs there country and what happens in them. Why is this not happening the way our founders wanted it. Having the Electoral College is not a bad idea but, its not a great one. Demolishing the Electoral College is the only fair way.

In the article "" In Defense of the Electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Although it mention how good the Electoral College is it also mentions how ""the Electoral College method of selectin the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carry their state....Knowing their vote will have no effect"". Popular vote don't seem to matter, The Peoples vote don't seem to matter.

Others may argue that the Electoral college helps break a tie but, that only happened one time. If we ever had a issue like that again we could just enforce the Electoral College but, the people the say of who leads us after all we are one nation under god. In the article"" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford plumer states"" Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Furthermore he goes on to say ""¬† state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Can't we just enforce the Electoral College when we need a tie breaker. The Electoral College consist of five-hundred thirty-eight electors which happens to be an even number. Even if its a slight chance couldn't an Electoral College voting happen to be a tie. The population doesn't have even or odds in this case because every year new people are getting to the age that¬† they can vote.

In the article ""what is the Electoral college?"" The Office of the Federal Register states that"" the founding fathers establish it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the presidentby a vote in congress and the election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" As you see it says a comprimise not total dictatorship. Everybody has rights voters rights are being tampered with. freedom to vote doesn't seem neccessary because we may have freedom to vote but our votes isn't making a difference. As Plumer said if there is a chance of a tie "" the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president....Because each state cast only one vote ,the single reprsentative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representative from California, who represent 35 million voters.""

49FC821C639A,"Cars are useful machines that get you around. But what you may not realize is the many problems that they may cause. The emissions from car tailpipes can cause environment issues and pollute the atmosphere with greenhouse gases. Some advantages from limiting car use include environmental improvements and recreational and personal advancement. Reducing car usage would be a benefit to most cities.

The atmosphere has been at an all time high in pollution, smog and green house gases are effecting cities. In Paris, France near-record pollution has been occuring and Paris decided to enforce a partial driving ban to help clear the air of the city. According to the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. Coldnights and warm days caused the warm layer of air to trap the car emissions into the atmosphere. In Bogota, Colombia there is a declared day without cars in the capital city of 7 million people. According to the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, the turnout was large and even the rain wouldn't stop them from participating. Carlos Plaza which was interviewed for the article stated ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Using less cars will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants according to Elisabeth Rosenthal author of ""The End of Car Culture"". Overall limiting car use will be a big factor in conserving resources and lowering emissions.

This limitation of cars would be beneficial to personal and recreational purposes also and not just the environment. In the town Vauban, Germany 70 percent of families do not own cars. According to the article ""Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, citizens claim to be happy this way. ""When I had a car I was always tense. ""I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter. In this new approach of limited car use, stores are placed just a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. This provides an easier way to get what you need in a fast and convenient manner. In Bogota, Colombia, parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city and sidewalks are being replaced, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. A network of public transportation could be created to save time and improve safety. Reducing car use creates an opportunity for more recreational buildings and stores to be created near your community for your benefit.

Reducing car use would be a huge environmental benefit, helping lower the amount of smog and carbon emissions. This would also create the opportunity for recreational and business improvements, which would help create new shopping districts and recreational buildings closer to your community. In general limiting car use would create a cleaner and safer environment but would still be able to provide you with new entertainment and a stronger local community.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Not only can you help, but this job does inquire some fun! You have the benifit to see and tour special landmarks and places that you have never seen before! It is quite an adventure! It is an unbelievable oppertunity to see all kinds of sites (especially on the job!).

On board, you can also find time to have fun! When you are on return trips after the animals are unloaded, you can play many games such as baseball, volleyball, and table-tennis in the empty holds where the animals stay. Fencing, reading, whittling, fun games, and boxing make some boat trips exciting!

Overall, taking part in the seagoing Cowboys program is an excilent oppertunity! It is more of a new world rather then just an site-seeing adventure! Taking part in this activity would make you feel better about helping not just your community, but citizens beyond your community, too! Helping those who need your support is quite the heroic thing to do!   ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
C676CE973E9E,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that extending the school day has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it can provide more time for students to learn and improve their grades, but on the other hand, it can lead to burnout and a lack of work-life balance.

One of the main benefits of extending the school day is that it can provide more time for students to learn and improve their grades. With more time in the classroom, students can receive more instruction and practice, which can lead to better academic performance. Additionally, students can have more time to complete assignments and projects, which can help them develop important skills such as time management and organization.

However, there are also some disadvantages to extending the school day. One of the main concerns is that it can lead to burnout. With more time in the classroom, students may become overwhelmed and stressed, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health. Additionally, students may have less time for extracurricular activities, such as sports or clubs, which can be an important part of their overall well-being.

Another potential disadvantage of extending the school day is that it can lead to a lack of work-life balance. Students may feel like they are constantly in school, with little time for relaxation and leisure activities. This can lead to feelings of exhaustion and frustration, which can negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being.

In conclusion, while extending the school day can provide some benefits, such as more time for learning and improving grades, it also has some potential disadvantages, such as burnout and a lack of work-life balance. Ultimately, the decision to extend the school day should be carefully considered, taking into account the needs and well-being of both students and teachers.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,7

I think you should allow students to bring their cell phones incase if they have to make a call during their lunch or free periods. I agree as long if the students don't have the cell phones on during class time or else they should be confiscated. If the cell phone aren't allow in school and if the student/students has an emergency they can immediately call a relative or friend to come pick them up from the school, but you have to talk to the relative or friend just to be sure the student isn't cutting from class time. Some high school allow the first Policy between periods and during their lunch periods. So my conclusion is I really support cell phones allow in school during their free periods or lunch periods as long it off during class and if it is on then you shall confiscate it until a parent comes to take it from school.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

You should consider changing the call phone policy to Policy 1.

""Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.""

Policy 1 should be picked because the policy allows students to bring cell phones into school as sometimes students need to use their cell phones after school. Students keeping their cell phones off during class time but allowing students to bring the cell phones in school will allow students to contact their parents after school. Policy 2 does not allow students to bring their cell phones into school is too restrictive on students. Allowing cell phone use during lunch and other free time is also a good idea. Students can use the phones to contact other people outside school and can contact heir parents if they need to. They can also be contacted during their free time by family members to give them news that they would not know until after school when they get home.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
82DE4E49CC52,"Being idle is a concept that has been discussed by many philosophers and thinkers throughout history. Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, once said, ""I am a firm believer in the principle of economy and frugality."" This quote suggests that Jefferson believed that being idle was not only a waste of time but also a waste of resources. In this essay, I will analyze the concept of ""being idle"" as discussed in Jefferson's quote and as applied to various practical scenarios.

Firstly, it is important to understand the meaning of the word ""idle."" According to the Oxford Dictionary, ""idle"" means ""not working or not using one's abilities or resources in a productive way."" In other words, being idle means not doing anything productive or useful with one's time or resources. Jefferson's quote suggests that being idle is not only a waste of time but also a waste of resources, which is why he believed in the principle of economy and frugality.

One practical scenario where the concept of being idle applies is in the workplace. In today's fast-paced world, many people are constantly working and striving to be productive. However, there are times when employees become idle, such as when they are waiting for a task to be completed or when they are bored with their work. In these situations, it is important for employees to find ways to stay productive and use their time and resources in a more efficient manner. This can be achieved by taking breaks, learning new skills, or finding ways to make their current tasks more interesting.

Another practical scenario where the concept of being idle applies is in everyday life. Many people spend a significant amount of time doing things that are not productive or useful, such as watching television or scrolling through social media. While these activities can be enjoyable, they are not using one's time and resources in a productive way. In order to avoid being idle, individuals should strive to find activities that are both enjoyable and productive, such as exercising, reading, or learning a new skill.

In conclusion, the concept of being idle is an important one to consider in both practical scenarios. Thomas Jefferson's quote suggests that being idle is a waste of time and resources, which is why he believed in the principle of economy and frugality. In order to avoid being idle, individuals should strive to find",1,llammistral7binstruct,,6

I think the Electoral College should stay, because even if its ""indefensible"", ""Corupt"", ""Despised"" the Electoral College has its outcomes; Big States, Run-Offs and Presidential desputes. Its a process, Are own founding fathers who where enlightment thinkers, who thought more then what was written on the script. They thought outside the box, they wanted to know the ""why"" and how it will affect and how to bring this nation to its highest. Placing it in the constitution, knowing this method will do justice on future on elections. Its one of the best laid method in the world and removing it will just misbalance everything.

In the United States, each states has a majority and manority. Where people consist the most is by the coast, west and east. Its in are human nature, its been around for ages that humans live more on coastal or river areas. Any area where it consist of water,Harbor and trading routes. They recieve the most of products around the world, and maintain abondens of humans. So the bigger states are California, Florida, NY, Virgina, Texas and etc. The electoral votes restores the balance. In campaigns propaganda is used alot. Comercials, ads, anything they can publish themsleves to show and persaude the people in allections. Largers states gets more attention from preseidential candidates then smaller states. Smaller states in the middle of the U.S consist of small polpulations so with electoral votes the weight using the population (census) lose by the virtue of mal-Appointment of the senate. Its all about propaganda that presidential campaigners use to get the big states attention cuase that where the points are at.

Electoral College avoids problem with run-offs in which no candidate recieves a majority vote cast, which is the popular vote. Presidential desputes accur when a campiegner manepulates the people with spitting out promises in Propaganda ads, winning the popular vote. But with electoral college, you have a second chance to look closely on whats happening. With electoral college and electing a president you need a system.¬† If the majority of the states and senate are republican and the president is a democrate the two partys arnt gonna agree on anything. Desputes will accure and in 4 years the country will accomplish nothing. With electoral college theres a balance of votes, each states gets there political party they voted on and it evens out when the day comes. Voting is important cuase your choosing whos gonna lead your country for the next four years and electoral college opens up many doors that will help you analysis better in whats accuring and your setting up your country system.

The electoral college may have its problem buts a system that will carry out the nation longer without many torubles then without it.¬† Are founding fathers knew what they where doing, they thought big the U.S and look where the U.S is now. One of the strongest nation in the world, thanks to the system they created and left us.

NASA is a space program in the U.S. It has been for quite some time now. NASA has sent numerous things into space but one in specific has caused a great deal of curiosity through out the world. In 1976, a NASA spacecraft, Viking 1, took pictures of Mars and something unusual happened. A face apeared in a picture. At first NASA thought of the possibility of it being a foreign life form. But that possibility was stopped when scientists found out that it was just another Martian Mesa. A common landform on Mars. When the pictures were released to the public, many thought that NASA was lying, especially conspiracy theorists. They thought that NASA didn't want the public to know about an alien life form. That was very irrational.

Many people don't like the idea of space exploration because they say it's a waste of money. If NASA encountered foreign life forms, it would only be benefitial to tell the public because then NASA would gain popolarity and skeptism of the program would decrease. Many people would be curios about it and would want to know more about the race. Therefore NASA would have a better reputation and be more popular because of their discovery.

Secondly,technology has changed significantly since 1978. The original picture looks more like the face than any other one because of the old technology. In 1998, the picture looks more detailed. In 2001, it looks even more detailed. In 1976 the camera that took the photo only captured 43 meters per pixel making it much less definated compared to the picture taken in 2001 that captured 1.56 meters per pixel. This technology makes it less of a face.

Finally, because of the newer and more advanced technology, NASA's scientists could look further in to the so called alien face. After studying it, the scientists concluded that the ""face"" was a mesa. A mesa isnt't only found on Mars. It can also be found on Earth. There is one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and it even has the same height as the Face on Mars. The ""face"" is more of a natural landform than anything.

New technoogy, comparable lndforms, and the explanation of how alien races would benefit NASA helped the space program prove conspiricy theorists and the public wrong. All of these supports are hard evidence that the face was a mesa in disguise. Although the finding of an alien race would be revolutionary, it's safe to say that the ""face"" isn't the discovery of one. We'll just have to wait until the future to encounter a race that isn't our own.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

I very much think that the voting of the president should be changed to popular vote rather than the electoral college. There is too many things that can go wrong with he electoral college. If popular vote is taking place, it solves many problems. For examble, the electoral college does'nt have to vote for the president they were chose for, and a tie could end up happening because the votes are even at 538.

Many important people of the government have tried to abolish the electoral college at times, including Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. There is many flaws within the electoral college. Like in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but then lost the electoal vote, if this is a government based on what the people want, then popular vote should by far be appointed over the electoral college.

In 1976 a tie could of been very possible, if 5,559 voters in ohio would of voted oppisite, and 3,687 would of voted oppisite, there would of been a complete disaster in the election. In 2000, people in 25 of the biggest media states didnt get to see any campaign adds, also voters in 17 states didnt even see the candidates at all!

Some people feel that if there was a popular voting for the president, there would be many disputes, but if this is a democracy and the government is ran by the people, then the popular vote is by far better than the electoral college.

All in all, popular vote is just the better way to go, it'll be what the people want, and there wont be any questions asked about the outcome of the election.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

I believe that we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College has been a huge part of America since our founding fathers, who established this process. This process helps keep America in order in and in line. Where would our country be without it? We would be lost and confused with no direction to follow. The Electoral College helps keep America's voting process organized, which is key to a well functioning country. Which is why I believe that we should absolutley keep the Electoral College so that our voting process stays organized and because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning.

I believe we should keep the Electoral College because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning. Our founding fathers were the ones the establish the Electoral College which means it has been around since the beginning of our country. We should not change this tradition of America because it has seemed to kept us running smoothly for this long so why would we want to change that for no reason? If we stopped this tradition and changed it to all popular vote from citizens we would be hurting America in a huge way. It would completely change our ways of thinking, living, and running of America. Yes, a lot has changed in America since our founding fathers and yes change is sometimes for the better in our country because things are obviously different now then what they were 200 years ago but change would not be for the better in this situation. Let's say your grandmother, Mr. Senator, has had a peach cobbler recipe in your family for ages and it just takes your breath away with all the flavor and its divine taste, but this recipe is very old. If your grandmother's old recipe taste so delicious you would not want to change one thing about that recipe. Well same with the Electoral College. Its extremely old but it has also kept our country running well and has not failed us yet so we should not change this process just like you would not want to change your grandmothers peach cobbler recipe. This is why I think we should keep the Electoral College because it has kept us going since the beginning and you do not change something just because it is old or thought of being outdated.

Voting for someone to be the head and leader of an organization is an extremely big deal, especially when that organization is a country with laws, citizens, and many other important topics. America needs to have a president willing to stand up for what is right, be there for his people, and run America in a smooth and organized fashion. If the elections were based upon popular vote then imagine what could happen, someone running for president could act like a person who is willing to take on the huge responsibility and stand up for what is right, but when everyone votes for him and they get into office then they turn into a total coward and someone not determined enough to take on the responsibility or take on America. With Electoral College those running for president are also being voted on by Congress and qualified citizens. This makes things run much more smoothly because citizens are still getting to put there two cents in but only if they are qualified which is much more reasonable. Citizens are a huge part of America, they have a lot to do with America running smoothly or not, which is why they should have a say in who runs their country, but no so much of a say that its unorganized and completely on their own opinion. I mean lets face it, us citizens have our flaws and dont always make the best decisions or have the best opinions. Having qualified citizens voting and Congress members voting make it much more understandable. Most Congress members will have been in Office for a very long time which makes them wiser and better to understand the whole voting process, the way America runs, and laws. Most will be able to pick out the better qualities for president out of each of the members running for president. This is why I belive we should keep the Electoral College because it keeps voting organized.

The Electoral College is what keeps our voting process in order. When something gets old you do not throw it away if it still is of good use for you and the Electoral College is definetly still in good shape and is doing our country well so we should not change it because it has kept our country functioning from the beginning and so our voting process stays organized.

It can be as simple as exhibiting positive behaviors, such as being kind to others, showing understanding, and exuding a sense of warmth. These traits can inspire others to believe, respect, and trust us. As a result, our good examples can create opportunities for us, provide stability in our surroundings, and help us create a powerful legacy that can last for generations.

One example of how setting a good example can lead to positive outcomes is the story of Malala Yousafzai. Though she was born in a part of the world known for its patriarchal values, she persevered and fought for equal opportunities for girls‚Äô education. She spoke out against the injustice, sparking a movement and becoming a symbol of strength and courage for millions of young girls around the world.

An issue has come forward involving our fellow classmates. Should we or should we not be required to take part in community service? I think we should, and here are my reasons why. First, if you walk outside, and see litter over our beautiful grass, would you not want it to be clean? Would you like a big pile of trash on your lawn? I think not. Therefore, I think to make the world a better, and more cleaner environment, we should have kids our age helping out! Another reason why we should be required to be in the service is because it teaches us lessons. Nowadays, you see kids under the wrong influence of people. I believe that if we all work together to achieve something, we will see our wrongs and we would want to change. We hang out with the wrong people sometimes, and when kids work together, I noticed, we seem happier and more gentle working for something that will make us feel better in the future. Looking back at our memories, I believe that we will feel a sense of pride and a need to spread this good-willing service to our community. Another reason is that it will keep teenagers out of trouble. If, let's say, a boy robbed something. Is it better to shove him into a juvenile jail, lock him up, while he does nothing with his life? Instead, a good option would be making him work for the community. Like I stated before, it changes people. You can see right away, it makes us feel good. Like we are doing something with our lives. I believe that helping out our community will truly change the way we see our world. How we act, and how we care for our environment. Requiring to help in community service makes us proud that we are becoming a better person, helping others out. I believe that it also boosts self esteem up by a great difference. You see kids getting rejected by 'cool' teenagers everywhere, being bullied, harassed, and even feeling the need to not live anymore. Helping others, caring for others, will surely lift their self esteem, and they will feel not scared to live, but proud to be living and helping others while doing so. In the process of the volunteer work, I think that they will find such confidence in themselves, they will start to come out of their shell, and find a great person lying beneath there. Someone who helps others and likes feeling good. And the bullies? I believe they should also be required to help out with service. Deep inside, bullies are just scared little kids who don't have anything to live for, or their lives are so bad, they take it out on innocent people. What they don't see is the damage they do internally. Helping others, the opposite of what they do, will be a lifelong lesson that they will forever remember. I believe that if they volunteer at, for example, an orphanage, they will see their victims true side. Not a wimp, or a loser, or whatever names they call them. But a human, a person that has hopes and dreams like everyone has. Even themselves! This will give them a new sense of clarity, a need to apologize to their victims, and a need to help out more, discovering new ways to do good in their lives. In the process, they too can change, become more humble, and become a better person.

In conclusion, I hope you take the time to consider this letter, to make the hard decision of requiring the community service for your students. I believe you will make the right decision, and that you will ponder the good qualities of how we might change the world by helping out. Consider this question. What is this world coming to? Do we want the society we have now? Or would we like to make the world a better place by helping others, and changing in a good way to become a better person. Thank you for reading this, and I hope you will side with me and help us become good, educated, and caring students.

B7FCFC6A7011,"Sure, here's my essay response:

As an 8th grader, I'm excited to learn more about different topics that interest me. For my research project, I've chosen to explore pet daycares, fish habitats, plant care, and swimming teacher certifications.

First up, I researched pet daycares to learn more about the services they offer and the care they provide for animals. I discovered that pet daycares are designed to provide a safe and fun environment for pets while their owners are away. They offer activities like playtime, exercise, and socialization to keep pets happy and healthy. Some daycares even offer additional services like grooming and training. It's important to do my research and find a reputable pet daycare that meets the needs of my furry friend.

Next, I delved into the world of fish habitats and learned about the different types of fish and their necessary requirements for a healthy habitat. I found out that fish need a balanced diet, a clean environment, and proper water temperature to thrive. It's important to research the specific needs of the type of fish I want to keep and create a habitat that meets those needs. For example, some fish require a lot of hiding places, while others need a lot of space to swim.

After that, I explored the impact of temperature changes on plants and how to ensure they are correctly taken care of. I discovered that plants need the right temperature range to grow and thrive. Some plants prefer cooler temperatures, while others prefer warmer temperatures. It's important to research the specific temperature requirements of the type of plant I want to grow and take steps to create the right environment for it.

Finally, I researched certifications and additional qualifications that may be needed to become a swimming teacher or lifeguard. I learned that becoming a swimming teacher or lifeguard requires a certain level of training and certification. These certifications ensure that I have the knowledge and skills necessary to teach swimming lessons or monitor a pool safely. It's important to research the specific requirements for the certification I want to pursue and complete the necessary training to become certified.

In conclusion, my research project has taught me a lot about different topics that interest me. By doing my",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

BB02D525CE05,"In the article the author writes about the possiblity of the exploration of Venus and how it can contribute to scientific studies. He uses many detail from reliable sources like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for example. The author seems like a very reliable source to listen to about the exploration of venus.

The author explains to us the danger of Venus exploration by talking about the tempature,atmospheric pressure, constant storms and volcanos. The author then explains to us the readers NASA plans of sending a blimp like vehicle that can fly over Venus without the threat of ground conditions of the planet. He tells us the benefits of such a expedition like it would further understanding of the planet that we dont know much about.

In conclusion of all the danger the author tells us that it is possible to explore from a distance even though it will be difficult and challenging it possible and he shows us exploring Venus could be very valuable to the human race and could contribute to further space exploration.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
A366CC7B0D05,"First impressions are a crucial aspect of human interaction. They are the initial thoughts and feelings we have about someone or something, and they can greatly influence our future interactions with that person or thing. However, the question arises whether first impressions are truly impossible to change. In my opinion, first impressions can be changed over time, and I will provide two examples of how my first impression of someone has changed over time.

My first example is my impression of my English teacher in high school. When I first met her, I thought she was strict and unapproachable. She always seemed to be in a bad mood, and she would give harsh feedback on our assignments. I believed that she was not someone I could connect with, and I was hesitant to approach her for help or advice. However, as time went on, I began to see a different side of her. I realized that she was passionate about teaching, and she genuinely cared about her students' success. She would often take the time to listen to our concerns and offer words of encouragement. I also noticed that she was not as strict as I had initially thought. She would give us more freedom to express our opinions and ideas in class, and she would often praise our efforts and accomplishments. Through these experiences, my first impression of my English teacher has changed completely. I now view her as a supportive and caring mentor, and I am grateful for the positive impact she has had on my life.

My second example is my impression of my neighbor. When I first moved into my house, I did not know my neighbor very well. I would occasionally see them outside or hear them playing music, but we never really spoke. I assumed that they were a reclusive and antisocial person, and I did not want to intrude on their privacy. However, as time went on, I began to see a different side of them. I would notice that they would often be outside playing with their dog, and they would wave and smile at me as I passed by. I also heard them laughing and joking with their friends, and I realized that they were not as reserved as I had initially thought. Through these experiences, my first impression of my neighbor has changed completely. I now view them as a friendly and outgoing person, and I enjoy striking up conversations with them whenever I see them.

In conclusion, first impressions are not impossible to change. They",1,llammistral7binstruct,,3
B3FE48815543,"For years and years, it has been said that emotion comes from the ""heart"", when really, emotions are scientific. In a classroom setting, many students feel as if they are in an uncomfortable environment, causing them to become silent and unable to ask questions. With the use of the technology called Facial Action Coding System, the teacher is able to modify what they are teaching to ensure everybody, even those who are quiet, understand. This new technology will offer students who are shy the same education as those who are not, modify a lesson for a certain student who is confused, and allow for a more positive environement in a classroom, making it valuable for students.

When eighteen girls and fifteen boys are put into a classroom, it is not always guranteed that they will have a friend in the class. Many times, when children do not feel welcome in an environment, they will not speak up or ask a question. This causes teachers to be unable to help the student understand what they are trying to learn. In the excerpt, ""Movement of one or more muslces is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, dear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles""(D'Alto 3). The technology is able to deeply read the expressions people make due to the movement of the muscles in the face. When someone has an emotion, sometimes, they unawarely show it. With FACS, the program can analyze that emotion , and give the feedback to the teacher to allow he/she to go back over the material that the student gave an emotion to. With the use of this technology, teachers can see how the students are feeling, without having to pull the answers out of the students who rarely talk.

The first thing most people notice when meeting someone for the first time or thousandth time is body language. It is scientifically proven that when someone is public speaking or talking, the focus is 90% body language/tone, and 10% material they are covering. From the way their voice is, or the way their face falls, a lot of information can be given. The new technology Facial Action Coding System allows for a computer to go deeper in analyzing the emotion of the face. A normal person is not going to immediately recognize that when the ""your oribularis oris, which is the muscle around your mouth tightens, it means you are showing anger""(D'Alto). The new program is able to analyze the muscles to give more of a precise and accurate reading of the emotion. Teachers meet students for 53 minutes a day, and are not mind readers who know how their students are feeling. The author claims, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'""(D'Alto 6). Since technology is the new way of learning this century, the computer's ability to be able to recognize confusion, and help modify the lesson to help increase understanding would be very valuable. There are many times when teachers let students go off and do the notes online, and many students may not catch on. With the ability to see they are not understanding, the student will not be forced to ask the teacher, but have the computer explain it. This would substantially help the students who are afraid of questions, and those who are absent from class. Having an instructor that knows every emotion that a student is feeling, and be there if modification is needed, would have a major impact on the succsess rate of students.

As more and more technology is being woven into todays ways of learning, it is important that it is grows along with the generation. Many times, students come into class with a ""I do not want to be here"" attitude. With attitudes like that, it decreases the success of the student. In the excerpt, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.....Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions""(D'Alto 9). Teachers could use these known tactics and have their students practice certain facial expressions to make them feel a certain way. If they are able to make the students smile, and it can allow for a slight feeling of happiness, resulting in a more positive environment. Students will participate more when put into an environment they feel welcome, and warm in, and by using the FACS program to see if they begin to feel happy, teachers can enforce more postivity in the classroom. The positive the classroom, the more particpation there is from students.

Although this program may not be 100% accurate since it doesn't know every emotion in the universe or what is going on in the person's brain, it can help teachers realize the basic emotions needed to see if their students are understanding. This new technology will offer students who are shy or quiet the same education as anyone else, allow for a more positive environment, and modify a lesson for a certain student if confused, overall making it very valuable for students in the classroom.

39065509F761,"Students these days have their technology, phones, computers, all sorts of stuff. But students should at least have time to do something else and not be stuck with a screen all the time. People should do something else then be in the house all the time, maybe go do something fun, and hang out with friends then texting them through a screen.

Why students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is to have better communication, be distracted away from an electronic, and to have a better health. Having better communication is good to have because then it's easier for you to start conversations with people that you don't really talk to. Another thing is, you will have more friends, building character in yourself makes you more stronger and having to do something more different and do something extra can help with that. Secondly being distracted from electronics is a good thing because then you have more time to do other things, like to go play outside and play soccer or something. Lastly having a better health is good, being inside all day is not good because you can gain lots of weight by just sitting all day and not do anything.

At the end people should do at least one extracurricular activity because to have better communication, be distracted away from electronics, and to have a better health. It will be better for yourself. Don't go and make yourself look horrible, enjoy life to the fullest, it will help a lot to get friends and start conversations with people. It will help you be a better you.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9
591E36982F38,"When asking for advice some people turn to just there best friend¬†or there parents. They assume that what they are saying is the right thing to do and probably¬†will listen to them and do whatever it is. This can lead people into arguments or bad situations that could go on for months. If you need advice for something you should ask more than one person so you have another persons perspective on your problem and here is why.

Advice can lead you into a good direction or sometimes bad. When asking for advice from someone you should go to at least¬†two people. Some people could relate to your problem and know what not to do and what to do where as others you might ask cant relate to them at all. It would also give you the thoughts of ""these are the things they said to do"" youll then figure out which one you will decide to use in your situation. When asking someone for advice you might not want to ask anyone that your best friends¬†with. They might tell you to do something that could get you in trouble, look bad, or possibly make them look good in front¬†of everybody. When it comes to getting advice you always need to think about who you should ask for your own benefits.

In Some situations when you ask multiple people and they each give you the same response then that might be the right thing to do. You still might want to ask another person until they have a different perspective on how to solve your situation. One day your outside when a bully decides to push you off the swing. You dont do anything about it because hes bigger and stronger than you. When you tell your friend he tells you to punch him the next time it happens. You go home and tell your mom what happened and what your friend said to do. Your mother tells you that instead of doing that you should tell an adult what is going on before things get worse. You are left to think about whos advice to take in your situation, lets say you take your friends advice. The next day your on the swing when the bully demands you to get off so he can swing. You do as your friend said and punch him, the teacher sees that you have hit another student and you will be in trouble while the bully gets away with it all. Now lets say you take your mothers advice. You go to school the next day and tell your teacher about what the bully has been doing to you, she says she will watch during recces to see what is going on. That day the bully comes over to the swings and demands you to get off. When you tell him no, he pushes you to the ground and takes it himself. The teacher has seen what happened and confronts the bully. They bully gets in trouble and you can get back onto the swing.

Advice is something that everyone should think about before they do something or give advice to another. If you dont know what someone should do then its best you tell them that instead of giving them bad advice. Multiple people can give you multiple opinions of which you can choose what to do or whos advice to take. Asking more than one person is a good thing that everyone should do before they take advice from one person.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,7
A52088EEF3C7,"I beleive that we should change the Electoral College becuase even when one president wins the election from the people he can lose the election. For example one person running for president can get 154 more popular votes, but if the other person recieves 270 electoral votes or more then they would win foe example in the text it states ""it is entirly possibe that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"". Even though i think the electoral college is bad there are some good things about it, For example it states in the text ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a disput over the popular vote"". But despite that the Electoral college is an accident waiting to happen, and just because no one has fought or protested agaist the Electoral College over the years its been alive doesn't necessarally mean its not going to happen in the future.

18DFC8ABFA92,"Students . . . imagine being able to wake up for school in the morning but not have to leave the house, this can become a normal reality for all students enrolled in school if they were allowed to take their school courses online. People work better in an environment they are most comfortable in, which would be their home. Students would benefit from taking classes from home by being in the comfort of their home, not having to find transportation, nor having to interact with people in person if they're shy or antisocial.

Being in the comfort of their home can benefit students when working. If Generic_Name was in a school where he got bullied and picked on for his extremely small size then he would not want to be there but rather, somewhere where he feels safe and comfortable. When Generic_Name tries to do his work, all he would think about is what the other kids are saying about him or what they'll make fun of him for during lunch. When Generic_Name goes to school and has to sit in a chair all day in class, he obtains back problems. If he were at home he could sit on his bed and move around to stretch out his body to stay loose therefore, making his back not get any aches. Students being able to work in a place they're most comfortable could make them more productive.

Not having to find transportation to school would make things tremendously easier on students. Generic_Name's parents both work away from home for the Government in Generic_City. and her house is in Generic_City while her school is in Generic_City, 30 minutes away, so there isn't a bus that comes to get her therefore, she either doesn't go to school or takes an Uber, when her parents can pay for one. If Generic_Name could take school from home then she wouldn't have to miss so many days and her parents wouldn't have to pay for Ubers most of the days. Generic_Name lives 1 mile away from her bus stop, that she's supposed to walk to every morning but, she doesn't want to walk alone in the dark and her parents can't walk her because they have to work so, they try to get family members to drive her to school but most of the time they're busy. If Generic_Name was able to take her classes from home then she would'nt have to worry about walking in the dark in the mornings, where she feels scared but instead, she would'nt have to leave her house for school. Students being allowed to do school¬†from home, would'nt have to find transportation, when they don't have it.

Students who are antisocial and don't want to interact with people, would'nt¬†have to, if they took school at home. Generic_Name doesn't like to talk to people in person because he gets nervous and then blacks out, like when Generic_Name asked for his number during lunch break at school and then he fainted in the middle of the Cafe. If Generic_Name could take school at home then he would'nt have any problems with getting nervous then blacking out or fainting. Generic_Name¬†doesn't talk to anyone because she gets very awkward around any new person she meets and embarrasses her self, like when Generic_Name asked what her name was in Science class and then she farted on him and fell out of her chair and onto the floor. If Generic_Name could take school from home then she would'nt have to socialize with any new people and embarrass her self. Antisocial students being able to take school from home would allow them to only have to interact with their family, that they already know, and no one new to them.

By being in the comfort of their home, not having to find transportation, nor having to socialize with people in person, when they dont want to, students would benefit from taking their school classes from home. Students can be more productive in the comfort of their home rather than in a public place, like school. Students without transportation to school, would'nt need to struggle to find any if they took their classes from home. Antisocial students would'nt be forced to socialize¬†when they don't want to, if they got the chance to take their classes at home.

895C138F1444,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage in America, and all around the world. As the future grows near, gas prices are skyrocketing and frankley, gas is being all used up. Cities and communities are building subburbs that dont allow cars and passing laws that ban driving. Many people may read this and view it as unfair or irrelevant, but we should be applauding it and considering these ideas in our own communities.

Vuban, Gerrmany is one of the pioneer subburbs to try the following idea. In this Subburb: Street parking, driveways, and home garages are all not allowed. Instead, when you buy a house, you buy a parking space at a large garage for 40,000$. You keep your car there while you live in the homes. Some statistics back up this movement as well. In Europe, cars are responsible for 12% of gas emissions, and in the some parts of the US, cars are responsible for up to 50%. Cutting down on driving helps the enviroment and lowers accidents and fatal driving deaths each year.

Paris, France is having some conflict with automobiles as well. The smog caused by the surplus of cars was filling the city and harming residents. As a result, Paris had to ban driving that day and fine those who drove anyway. This was all in effort to reduce smog and pollution from the city. Once the smog cleared they lifted the ban. Many counties along with Bogota, Columbia have participated in banning cars for a day or week to reduce it bad effects on nature.

Even the United States is getting in on the action. Over the last few years, citizens are buying fewer and fewer cars each year, suggesting Americans best car days are behind us. If this pattern persists it will have major implications on carbon emmision and the enviroment. People taking the bus or biking to work have played a huge role in car sales dropping. There has also been a drop in 16 - 39 year olds obtaining drivers licences. Instead, they prefer getting rides and car-pooling with friends.

As you can see limiting car usage has global effects on safety and the enviroment. America and many other cities and communities around the world realize car's effects and are moving on from them, and from what I see, im very excited.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
7DBD4EBDC0E6,"Phones and Driving

The use of phones has grown tremendously to the point that people feel as if they can't survive without them. It's bad to know that our phones are becoming more and more of our lives and that people can't take their attention off of them for minutes while they are on the road. I personally don't think people should be able to use phones while driving because it delays everything as in the way people drive how they are at stop lights and all of that. Many bad things have come from people driving and texting so I dont think it should happen that people can excess phones while driving.

There are many delays when people are on their phones. If they drive you can pretty much tell if they are on them because, it will show they will sit at the stop light longer even after the light turns green and they drive slower. You have to remember to when you are driving like this it puts others at risk of kids if they are playing and you don't see them because you are on the phone it will put them at danger if you do something. A lot of drivers that do this don't think of it as a risk because it benefits them but it truly is because, its putting every one in danger including them because their attention is altered and the person in front of them may make a sudden change.

I was looking at a document and it said that texting and driving is comparable to drinking under the influence if not worse and I could see that because when they are on the phone they swerve and slow down and their attention isn't on the road at all. People who are texting while driving are 23% more likely to crash their cars. This percentage is equivalent to that of the average person who has drunk four beers and then began to operate a car which is scary because, I am on the road pretty much everyday and to know that these people are out there too is terrible. If phones are worse than drinking I feel that it should be illegal to be on your phone while driving because, it is illegal to drink and drive so this should be too.

In conclusion, I don't agree with being on your phone while driving is right and it should be banned. A lot of bad outcomes can come from a person being on their phone. It's very sad to think about what could happen. People have kids and still drive with them for example my cousin does it and it's sad that she can put her selfish needs to the side for one minute to focus on the road so her and her baby can get to where they need to go safely. My mom always says I think about myself and others which is good because I always analyze everything for everyone and I want everyone to be good so if I need to get off my phone for a few mins for a safer drive I am fine with that.

I have always viewed my problems as a chance for me to do my best. Instead of being overwhelmed and defeated by them, I try to remain focused and look for solutions. By taking this approach, I have learned how to be resilient and determined, and am constantly striving to become better.

better relationship with family and friends and good life in general.

Positive attitude is more effective in the job, because we have to believe in our self for example; Generic_Name is working in a company they have a big project and everybody say This is too much we cant do this all this is wrong but Generic_Name say all is possible in a teamwork, is very effective if all the pieces are good nothing cant be wrong Generic_Name always have good attitude and is that why the boss always say go and ask for help to Generic_Name.

A person with positive attitude is a support, for example: Generic_Name have a big problem, but Generic_Name have a friend and her friend is her support, because with somebody is in problems need friends with good energy positive attitude.

Parents might not like having to pick there kid up everyday after school. Parents also might not like there kids being stressed over school work. Kids all ready have to stay at¬†school for 7hours a day if they stay after its like 9 hours a day. Also as you¬†get older you get tired easier so them 8th grade kids are going the go to sleep when they get home and forget about there homework and they might not even eat. I think parents would like to see there kids at the dinner tables and not sleep all day.

Now let me tell you how this all adds up. First you have to find a activity then you get cut from sports and you cant find the right club. Then you finally¬†find a club but turns out you dont like the club and you have to do it all year. Then you come home all stressed out because you dont like the club and have a lot of work to do and you tired. So then you get to sleepy so you take a nap but you sleep to long now you didnt finish the homework that you were going to turn in the next day. Now you have a bad grade and your mom is on your case about your work now your even more stressed. Then you quit the club because you so stressed out. Now when sols come you have a NHI in the grade book cause you didn't do the club.

84FC9651F650,"Hey, Mrs. Smith! Here's my essay on first impressions. I hope you don't mind if it's not perfect, I'm still learning how to write essays. üòÖ

First impressions are super important because they can shape how we behave and feel around someone. If someone has a good first impression of us, they might be more likely to trust us and want to be friends. On the other hand, if they have a bad first impression, they might not want to hang out with us or even talk to us. It's like, if someone is really mean to us at first, we might not want to give them a second chance. But, sometimes first impressions can be impossible to change. Like, if someone thinks we're weird or something, it might be hard to make them see that we're actually cool.

It's important to accept people for who they are, even if we don't like their first impression. Like, if someone is really shy and doesn't talk much, it's okay if we don't get to know them right away. We should give them some time and space to open up. And if someone is really different from us, like they have a different culture or something, we should try to learn about it and be respectful. It's not fair to judge someone based on one impression, because people can change and grow.

I know I've had some pretty bad first impressions with people, but then I got to know them better and realized they were actually pretty cool. Like, there's this one kid in my class who's always making jokes and stuff, but he's actually really funny and nice once you get to know him. So, it's important to give people a chance and not judge them too quickly.

In conclusion, first impressions are important, but they're not always accurate. We should try to accept people for who they are and give them a chance to show us their true personality. And, yeah, sometimes it's hard to change people's first impressions, but it's worth it to try.

BE6A28051A30,"Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it is important to understand its role in pursuing success. Failure is often seen as a negative thing, but it can actually be a valuable learning experience. When we fail, we are forced to examine our actions and make changes to improve in the future. This can lead to greater success in the long run.

Life can be a mean and nasty place, and criticism from others can be tough to handle. It is important to remember that not everyone will agree with us, and that is okay. We should take constructive criticism to heart and use it to improve ourselves. It is also important to surround ourselves with positive and supportive people who will encourage us to keep going.

Self-determination and self-worth are crucial in achieving success. We must believe in ourselves and our abilities, and have the drive to pursue our goals. It is important to remember that success is not just about external validation, but also about internal satisfaction. We must value our own worth and not let the opinions of others define us.

Starting a new job can be overwhelming and we may not be completely confident. It is important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and it is okay to ask for help. We should also take the time to learn and grow in our new role, and not be afraid to take risks. This can lead to greater success and a sense of accomplishment.

The relationship between failure and success is complex. Failure can lead to greater success, as it can teach us valuable lessons and help us grow. On the other hand, success can also lead to complacency and a lack of motivation to continue striving for greater things. It is important to remember that failure is not the end of the road, and that success is a journey, not a destination.

In conclusion, failure is an important part of pursuing success. We must learn from our mistakes and use them to improve in the future. Life can be tough, but it is important to surround ourselves with positive and supportive people. Self-determination and self-worth are crucial in achieving success.

DE962FEDCD9E,"Self-esteem is a crucial aspect of a person's mental and emotional well-being. It is the belief in oneself and one's abilities, and it plays a significant role in how individuals perceive themselves and the world around them. While some may argue that self-esteem is based on external factors such as appearance or social status, I believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. In this essay, I will provide evidence to support this claim and discuss how praising great students can help foster a positive learning environment and encourage students to reach their goals.

Firstly, achievement provides a sense of accomplishment and mastery over a particular task or subject. When students achieve something they set their minds to, they feel a sense of pride and satisfaction. This sense of accomplishment can be seen in the smile on a student's face when they solve a difficult problem or receive an A on a test. Achievement provides a sense of purpose and direction in life, and it helps students develop a strong work ethic and resilience.

Secondly, achievement is a tangible measure of one's abilities and potential. When students achieve something, they demonstrate that they possess the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed. This demonstration of competence can be seen in the form of a well-written essay, a successful presentation, or a well-executed experiment. Achievement provides evidence that students are capable of great things and that they have the potential to achieve their goals.

Furthermore, praising great students can help foster a positive learning environment and encourage students to reach their goals. When students are praised for their achievements, they feel valued and appreciated. This feeling of value can motivate students to continue working hard and striving for excellence. Praising great students also sets a positive example for other students to follow. When students see their peers being praised for their achievements, they are more likely to strive for greatness themselves.

In conclusion, I believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. Achievement provides a sense of accomplishment and mastery, a tangible measure of one's abilities, and a positive example for others to follow. Praising great students can help foster a positive learning environment and encourage students to reach their goals.

E03990305B4E,"The role a car plays in the life of an individual has made changes through out the years. There never was a significant meaning to having a car; it just meant having a vehicle that can get you from point A to point B. As the human society continues to progress with the creations of technology, the use of cars has diminished greatly in different parts of the world. Not being able to use a car seems like there is no bright side, but there are actually many advantages on limiting car usage.

The United States always had this recognition of being one of the world's prime car cultures. ""The first Model T cars were born in the U.S. It has also been the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized 'Mustang Sally."" President Barack Obama identifies in the article,

The End of Car Culture, his dreams for the U.S ""to curb the United State's geen house gass emissions will get a forturious assist from an incipent shift in American behavior."" Going back to the article as reference, studies show ""americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by... as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak... there was also a drop in percent of 16- to 39- year olds getting a license."" The cause of the downfall in car usage can be pointed towards a few factors; internet making telecommuting possible, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of cellphones and car-pooling apps. It is not because society assumes cars are becoming of no use, the role of technological improvements are making things a lot easier than how things were in the 1960's. The United states has the option of using cars or not, in other places like Paris, the option to drive has become a choice made out of a person's own power.

Paris, France is a location that anyone dreams of visiting. The city is beautiful but the levels of smog have made it impossible for people to enjoy the views of the city. According to the article,

Paris bans driving due to smog , ""it has been enforced to the citizens of a partial driving ban in order to clear the air... people were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine which is $31 in the United States."" The way things are organized in Paris goes by a person's license plate number. In correlation to the article, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifiying smog."" However, not all of the cars used in Paris, France were banned. Those cars that are plug-ins, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers were allowed to roam the street of Paris. A good majority, 67 percent, of vehicles in France are made up of diesel, and that kind of fuel were the ones to blame since gasoline was not in favor in a city like that one. In the same way, places like Bogota, Colombia, had similar situations as the peolpe that live in France.

In the country of Colombia there has been a day dediated to doing things with no car; it's a car-free day. In contrast to how banning driving is in Paris, Bogota, Colombia has everyone participate in this 24 hour event. If a person were to violate the rule they are to face $25 fines. The article,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, explains that ""millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during the car-free day."" Just like the goals in Paris, Colombia has goals to promote alternatice transportation and reduce smog. A businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, explains ""it's¬† good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" No one would everythink that driving is as stressful as going to work. When put into mind, things begin to make sense. The early mornings of road rage people encounter makes their entire day a little more stressful than what it should be. Driving is a wonderful advantage but there is always more than just a car. Colombia's main goal, as expressed in the article ""is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.""

In the end of it all cars have always been in the making; trying to find new ways to improve and modernize. Although cars may have had significant meanings in the older times, as society continues to prosper in technological making, cars are beginning to be identified as material objects that are not as important. They are just in use for people to get from one place to the next when other things are not working.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
C53073A5A9CB,"Hey, I'm like, totally stoked to be writing this essay! üòÉ As an 8th grader, I've been thinking a lot about how some people are always on the go, while others just chill at home. Like, what's up with that? ü§î

So, I decided to compare and contrast the qualities of active people versus idle people, and how it can affect their potential for success. üí™

First off, active people are totes more likely to be successful. They're always hustling, whether it's in school, sports, or their personal lives. They're like, always doing something, whether it's studying for a test or practicing their basketball skills. They're like, always on the move! üèÄüìö

On the other hand, idle people are, like, super chill. They just sit around and do nothing. They might watch TV or play video games, but they're not really doing anything productive. They're like, missing out on so much! üì∫üïπÔ∏è

But here's the thing: being idle can be okay sometimes. Like, sometimes you just need to chill and relax. It's important to take breaks and not be too hard on yourself. But, like, too much of a good thing can be bad. üò¥üëÄ

So, in conclusion, active people are more likely to be successful because they're always doing something. But, like, it's also important to take breaks and chill out sometimes. It's all about finding that balance, you know? üòéüëç

8A8B13591181,"While owning a car may seem like the most important possession a person can have, it is becoming more beneficial to find a way to live without them. Cities around the world are turning in their cars, even if just for a day, and finding that it brings plenty of advantages to make up for what could be seen by some as a troublesome lack of easy transportation. Both the environment and and the well being of the people are grateful for the new change, and examples of such will follow.

To begin, according to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, one can learn about Vauban, Germany, a place manifested so that residents of the upscale community must give up their cars. While residents are still permitted to own cars, they must be kept in large garages at the edges of the community. Here, the owner of the car must buy a space within the garage, along with a home in the residence. Parking on the streets is forbidden, along with driveways and home garages. The streets of the residency are completely free of cars, except for a few streets on one side of the community, and for where the tram to downtown runs through. Most of the citizens of Vauban choose not to own a car, or sold their car in order to move to the community, and find they are much more content in their lifestyle because of it. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, stated that she is ""much happier this way"", explaining that she was always tense while in possession of a car. This community was created as a prime example to showcase the advantages of limited (or forbidden) car usage, and it is now being used as the basis of the growing trend around the world, including America and more places in Europe, in which suburban life is being seperated from its former dependance on auto use.

Furthermore, the reduction of air pollution and smog has become a major advantage in the limitation of car usage. After suffering through days of near-record pollution, Paris, France had composed a temporary driving ban in an attempt to clear the air, according to Rober Duffner in ""Paris Bans Driving due to Smog"". The passage goes further to explain that the ban followed five days of smog that rivalled the likes of Beijing, China, which is widely recognized for being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Exceptions to the ban were made for hybrids and cars carrying three or more passengers, and public transportation was made to be free. Once the smog cleared enough, the ban was lifted and citizens were allowed back to the road, but the reduction of auto usage was what saved the air from becoming overly polluted. Moreover, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in a car-free day, entitled Day Without Cars, once a year to reduce smog in the cities, according to ""Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. Violators are charged with $25 fines, but, according to Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus, the people participate, and the turnouts are large. This day without cars, which has begun to spread to other Colombian cities, is a fantastic way to reduce both air pollution and stress, and is a part of a campaign to oversee the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which, according to Mayor Mockus, is the most of any city in Latin America.

In addition, ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal tells the reader of the new goals created to cut down on America's greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, the goals, set by President Obama, have been graciously aided by recent studies which show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and have been making less of an effort to get a license as the years go by. With transportation being the second largest source of the nation's carbon emissions, behind power plants, this pattern, if maintained, will most likely have majorly benificial impacts on the environment.

All in all, there are many advantages that could easily come with limiting car usage, including the reduction of smog and a more pleasent lifestyle for the citizens who decide to limit or cease their auto usage. While transportation issues may arise when people begin to give up their motorized vehicle, or if they decide to not purchase one in the first place, as many already have, a quick purchase of a bike or the use of public transit can solve at least some of them.

113000585851,"Dear Senator,

There has beeen some recent heat on the topic of the Electoral College. I believe that it is only fair to keep the Electoral College. Although some voters may be upset with the fact that they don't define who wins the presidential election, it is best that way. If there was no Electoral College people with no actual idea of whats going on would vote, and that could have a negative affect. Also if there was no Electoral College there would be an unfair amount of votes in larger states. The last reason is Swing States, which is also a very important part of the voting process.

First and Foremost, the Electoral College may make voters feel like they have no input on the election, but really they decide who the Electoral voters choose. Without Electoral voters, there would be indecisive people voting for a candidate they know nothing about. For example, many young voters base their votes off of popular opinion, not what they think is actually right. If there was no Electoral College, the Nation could be in a lot of trouble because many votes would be casted off of popular opinion. So it is good to have some control over what happens and who becomes president, but I think having the full decision to vote for whomever, and have it count, is overdoing it.

Secondly, I believe that having the Electoral College is great because, without it larger states would have more of a say on who becomes president. This would be very unfair to the smaller states for an obvious reason, population. Even though a few states might have a bigger population that doesn't particularly mean that everyone in the state will vote. There are still ""independent voters"". For example, as stated in paragraph twenty-one, the election voting in Florida was very close and relied a lot on popular votes. Florida ended up getting twenty-nine electoral votes, compared to Wyoming who only got three electoral votes. State size does matter because larger states will typically always get more attention from the presidential candidates than smalller ones.

Lastly, The Electoral College is a very important part of our voting process becaue of Swing States. As stated in paragraph twenty, voters in toss-up states are ""more likely to listen to the campaign and the competing candidates"". These voters know that their votes wont make much of an impression on the election, but pay the most attention anyways. People claim that the most involved voters should be able to decide the elections. Although they don't have much of a say it is nice to know that people do care about the elections and do pay close attention to what is going on.

To conclude my previously stated reasons, I believe that having the Electoral College is a crucial part of the system. Because without it the nation would have so many voters that only cast their votes based off of popular opinion. Also without it larger states would have more of an affect on the votes than the smaller states do. Finally, Swing States are a very important part of voting because voters who know what is going on and actually pay attention do have one of the biggest affects.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Driverless cars would not be a good thing because a computer does not react like a human.

Humans naturaly have a reflex that a computer doesn't, we see something run into the road and we know weather to slam on the breaks (in the case of a child) or run over it in hope you don't hit it (in the case of a squwarl).

A computer could mistake these suck objects and thus causing another problem of is it ""the driver or the manufacturer"" (10).

Also in the case where the car would control the speed of the car.

Say you were driving a woman to the hospidle because se is going into labor, or someone needs medical attenshion and you need to drive them there.

In cases such as these going the speed limit is not the best thing.

You would need to go over in order to save or help the person.

For reasones like this a computer as a driver would not be a good idea.

In the state of Indiana the manufacturing of car is one of the economical exports that we have.

If you were to take all those jobs and take them out to California to build driverless cars, that would hurt the economy of Indiada.

Also what about other formes of trancportation that require a driver?

The taxies of New York, or the local buses that run all over the country? what would happen to bus drivers jobs, would they all be replaced with driverless cars? For that reason of hurting the economy driverless cars would not benifit America.

Driverless cars also would restrict the freedoms of the individuwal.

Say you were of a drive and you wanted to go throught backroads to see the landscape, would the driverless car take you there or would it take you on the main highways? In these driverless cars how would the passanger be incontrol at all? Technology may be atvancing in many ways than one but I don't want the way I travel to be restricted.

Driverless cars would be horiable because computers can't react like a human can, we would loose jobs and it would effect the economy, and because they limmit the freedom of the passanger.

For all these reasons we should not have driverless cars.

More information about the ""Face on Mars"" is in the following statements.

It has been scientifically proven that the Face is nothing more than a rocky landform. Although it may seem to be formed my aliens, the Face truly is just a natural rock formation. There is no actual evidence of life on other planets. Why assume that just by a mesa? The Face is made up of shadows. You too can probably make shadows that look like something it is not.

NASA has taken photos at different pixel sizes. Not everyone agrees with NASA's statement because they truly believe that NASA is hiding information from them. Talk about the Face began after some people decided that it would be a ""good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Afterwards, many conversations and arguements were about the Face. It became a pop icon once it reached across the nation. Many people paid attention more to what they were watching rather than what they were told by NASA, the people with the facts.

Conspiracy theorists began saying that NASA was holding out on them by not saying the complete truth about their discovery. Much goes into a discovery that shouldn't go without apreciation. Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts. The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is just shadows that are made by indents on Mars.

173969D5E8D1,"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become mandatory in most of our lives. Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones Were founded in 1992. Since smartphones were created every year they get more modern. For example june 7, 2010 facetime was created. The smartphone is changing the human race in surprising ways.

Driving and using your cell phone at the same time is very dangerous. Most people think that they can drive so being on their phone while driving wont hurt anybody or anything, but anybody who agrees with this is wrong and is in danger every time he/ she pulls out a phone while the car is in drive. Also, if you use your cellular device and drive at the same time you always have someone else's life at stake. Even if you're in the car by yourself you can hurt someone else, imagine you have your head down in your phone while driving and you look up and you about to hit a car and swerve to the right and hit a whole family walking on the sidewalk. Then your in a bad situation just because you couldn't wait till you get home to text or look at your instagram feed. One little bad time to look at your phone and your hurting a family.

I believe that you shouldn't be allowed to use your phone while your car is in drive. In georgia they made a new law that you can't have your phone in your hand while on the road,not even to tap play and if you get caught the law enforcement will pull you over and give you a $50 fine. I believe it should be like this in every state , it the makes the community a lot safer. Did you know 11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. As of January 2019, three states -- Arizona, Montana, and Missouri -- insanely do not have laws against texting while driving.

According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers knows the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway. 21% of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones. The 2017 study published by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety Found that 87% of drivers view texting and driving as the most significant hazard on the road. In fact, drivers are more concerned about texting / distracted driving than they are about drunk driving. A single text can end many lives.

In conclusion, using your cellular device while driving is dangerous on all cases. Texting while driving causes 5 times as many accidents than drunk driving. A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year. I Think you can wait to answer that text.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Being in your own home can surround you with distractions and will effect the amount the student participates. Distractions like video games, pets, cell phones, and even food. All of these are monitored in a class room and can be controlled.

Also, cheating could be accessed very easily though online assignments. This is similar to my point on distractions because in school cheating can be monitored so much easier. There are some precautions and restrictions to make it difficult for the students to cheat but through the computer they can not fully put a stop to it. If the students are cheating and there is not anything stopping them they are not gaining any knowledge or benefiting from the course or subject but they will still be receiving credits for the class. Some schools implement web browser blocks so you can not research any information during an assignment and require you to have a web cam so they can watch you but there are to many faults in these systems that the online class gets taken advantage of.

Lastly, communication would be made extremely difficult through online learning. The teacher and student interaction would be poor. This would have a negative effect on the students progress and success in the class. People learn in so many different ways and rates that one teacher or a non responsive program would not be able to effectively teach a large class. Students would be left confused and unprepared if they did not understand a certain part of a lesson. The teacher would not be available to go in detail and a program could not provide more helpful information. The lack of interaction that you have in person or in a classroom would have a negative effect of the knowledge absorbed and the performance.

However, in some cases the distance learning from the home can be beneficial. For example, people in remote locations who cannot access public schooling could use this and people who struggle with anxiety could enroll and get an education through this program. This would be beneficial for people in situations like these listed.

Although, there are few cases where the online classes could trump classroom learning there is still too many cons out weighing the benefits from the program.

To be more specific, the distance learning and online schooling programs have too many flaws to be heavily depended on especially as your main source of education. Eventually, this could be a very successful thing for students all over, but until there is some refining it is not beneficial to the students. It is not worth it to be able to do your school from home if you are not getting the most out of it.¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9

I think that community service would be a good idea. It would help people out that are less fortunate then us. It would help elderly people or people that can't do much. It would also maybe help us learn about how lucky we actually are to have a house, and clothes, and food to eat everyday.

It would be a good idea but a lot of people wouldn't wanna do it. So if you made it small things or things that didn't take a lot of time to do then it would probably work. And maybe like each month if you got a certain amount of hours or did a certain amount of things then you could get a prize. I think more people would do that if they knew they could get a prize.

Plus you shouldn't tell the kids when they have to do it, you should let them pick because a lot of kids have sports like me. And when i get out of practice I'm tired so I would not wanna have to do community service. And a lot of kids are busy so letting them decide when to do it would be a good idea. And that would encourage more people to do it.

We could do such things as rake leaves, shovel snow, help out elderly people with needs, or even pick up trash on the road. We could even do things here in our school like help stack books in the library, help pick up trash in the hall ways, or even help clean up the lunch room on Fridays like some people do.

In conclusion I think it would be a good idea and many people would benefit from this. I think that it would also change our lives as well as many people that we would be helping. We would also be making our community a better place to live in and many people would be thankful for our help.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
75EB288E2375,"The articles explain that the limited use of cars or automobiles is to our advantage. Two reasons that support this theory is that one you won't have to stress about buying a car and making sure everyone has one, and second you will help to protect the environment from the harmful gases of automobiles.

The limitation on cars may have its advanatges because, among the billions of people on this earth many of them own cars. Many vehicles give off harmful pollution gases to the environment and can cause many endangering problems to people as well. Evidence from source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" can support the following... ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a parial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This evidnce supports the fact that there was enough smog in the air that led to the prohibition of cars for a limited time. This is to the people's advantage because they were now able to breathe fresh air instead of smog. Another piece of evidence also comes from source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensyfying smog...[The smog] rivaled with Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" This evidence shows that smog causes pollution which is harmful in many ways. It also shows just how much of a difference just five days of limitation on vehicles can help reduce pollution. So the sooner people can see what banning cars can do to their health and well-being then maybe they will see what the love and cherish so much, can actually be hurting them.

Car limitations may be the best thing yet for America and other places in the world. By banning cars we could reduce a lot of stress and the worry about the payments and supplying the vehicle with gas. Evidence that can support this comes from source 4: "" The End of Car Culture""¬† ""the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995....recession, because cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway."" This explains that many Americans cannot even afford cars. So they go about their days just fine taking public transportation or receivin rides from friends. So by banning cars we could actually reduce the stress of not having a car or making the payments on them... plus we would have better health. Out of the estimated 7 billion people on this earth, it is not guranteed that all of them around the ages of 15 and above are equipped with a a vehicel of their own. Evidence from Source 4: ""The End of Car Culture"" can support the following "" What most intrigues me is the rates of car ownership per househols and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" Thi just goes to show you that not only are cars bad for the enviornment and people's health but, they are bad financially for people to maintain and keep up. The automobile is what changed America back in the day. But it is causing some damae to us now.

Car limitations have some advanatges that are probably very beneifcial to us. We may think that cars are our only way of transportaion and that you need them to survive but, that is not necessarily true. Cars are great but up to a certain extent.       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
ED3AE3322B08,"Dear Senate,

It's offical, The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's really hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: ""Abolish the Electoral College.""

The Electoral College is a non-democraic method of selectiong a president that will be by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. According the the ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" article,"" the Elecoral College method is not democraic in a modern sense.....it is the electors who elect the president not the people."" So bascially we are voting for the electors and we keep our finger crossed that they vote for the president we want. It is unpractical that the people vote for the president they would like to govern their counrty and then the opposite party wins. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly ater Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College, won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct elecion to the kind we have now. The last election was yet another close one thanks to the Electoral College, which the popular vote winner lost the presidency. After all of this the Electoral College still has its defenders...

At the most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Candidates that don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.¬† During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.(Source 2)

The Elector Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. But other types of voters just like the ""play around"" according to article two.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apporionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution but is this system really the most logical one to use?(Source 3). True this system has worked for many years but it is time for a change. People are starting to think it is unfair and really poinless to even vote when the president they want will possibly not win anyway.

The single best argument against the Electoral College is what we might call the disater factor.( Source 1) The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. (Source 2) Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that popular vote would not have gone to Kennedy. (Source 3) In the same vein, ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. There are some reasons for retaining the Electoral College but it still lacks democratic pediree. And the people should have the right to vote on the president they think is the best for

OUR

country. After all its,""We the people"" not,"" We the electors"".

BA5DC45B0E3F,"In today's world, character is a difficult quality to define. Can it be measured? Is it based on a person's choices, or are we all pre-destined by life's influences? Irrespective of the answer, one cannot deny the role that both ‚Äúchoice‚Äù and external ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù have in shaping a person's character. 

For example, the choices a person makes with regard to their education and career can have a significant impact on their character. A person who chooses to forego higher education and instead pursue their passions despite it being considered unconventional by society and family, in turn demonstrates their strength of character, courage and conviction. Conversely, a person who chooses to stick to a socially accepted career path, for the purpose of stability, may be said to have a more pragmatic but less adventurous character. 

On the other hand, external experiences can have just as much influence over a person's character. Experiences ranging from loss, hardship, failure, tragedies, or rewards such as successes, successes, accolades, and other forms of achievement, can all leave an indelible impression and shape a person's character and outlook. For instance, overcoming adversity or tragedy can lead to a person's resilience and empathy, two qualities which can profoundly shape a person's character. Similarly, a person exposed to wealth and affluence may exhibit qualities of privilege, enabling them to view the world in a completely different way. 

In conclusion, our character is shaped by both our decisions and our life's influences. While our decisions give us a certain degree of control over our life's path, events and experiences will ultimately shape us, and our reactions to them, into who we are.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

Even though the Electoral College is a good way of selecting a president. This meathot has his flaws, under the electoral college system the people that vote are not voating for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. And I think that the people that vote shude vote directly for the candidate they have chousen.

This makes more sense that voting for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledge to the candidate.

I think at the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. Since the voter are not voting directly for their candidate of choise, I personaly dont think this is the best way to go. The popula elections provide a better way of voting for president. Since it means that the people that vote a voating directly to the candidarte and not the electors. The popular elections is a safer an more fair way to vote.

9551DA943B01,"First impressions are the initial thoughts and opinions that people have about someone or something. They are important because they often influence how people behave towards that person or thing in the future. In this essay, I will research why first impressions are important, why it is hard to change people's minds and the way they think about you, ways that first impressions can be changed, why it is often difficult to change a person's impression of you, how a person's first impression can affect their reputation, and summarize the importance of first impressions and why it can be hard to change them.

First impressions are important because they can greatly influence how people behave towards that person or thing in the future. For example, if someone has a negative first impression of a person, they may be less likely to interact with that person or give them opportunities. On the other hand, if someone has a positive first impression of a person, they may be more likely to interact with that person and give them opportunities. First impressions can also affect how people perceive a person's character, intelligence, and trustworthiness.

It is hard to change people's minds and the way they think about you because first impressions are often based on initial observations and assumptions. People tend to form opinions quickly and may not be open to changing their minds once they have formed an opinion. Additionally, people may be influenced by their past experiences and biases, which can make it difficult to change their perception of someone.

There are ways that first impressions can be changed. One way is to actively work on improving one's behavior and actions. For example, if someone has a negative first impression of a person because they perceive that person as untrustworthy, the person can work on being more transparent and honest in their actions. Another way to change first impressions is to actively seek out opportunities to interact with the person and demonstrate positive traits. For example, if someone has a negative first impression of a person because they perceive that person as lazy, the person can actively seek out opportunities to demonstrate their hard work and dedication.

It is often difficult to change a person's impression of you because first impressions are often based on initial observations and assumptions.

llama_70b_v1372,"I think that students should have the right to grade their teachers. It's important for teachers to know how they're doing and what they can do to improve. It's also important for students to have a say in their education and feel like their voices are being heard.

One reason why students should be able to grade their teachers is that it would help teachers to improve. If a teacher is doing something that's not helping their students learn, they should know about it so they can change it. For example, if a teacher is always talking too fast and their students can't understand them, the students should be able to tell them that so they can slow down. This would help the teacher to become a better teacher and the students to learn more.

Another reason is that it would make students feel more invested in their education. If students feel like they have a say in their education, they'll be more likely to care about it and try harder. For example, if a student knows that their teacher is willing to listen to their feedback and make changes based on it, they'll be more likely to pay attention in class and participate.

It's also important to note that students are the ones who spend the most time with their teachers, so they're in the best position to judge how well their teachers are doing. They see their teachers every day, so they're able to see how their teachers interact with them and how they teach. This means that their feedback would be valuable and accurate.

However, there are also some reasons why students should not be able to grade their teachers. One reason is that students might not be mature enough to give fair feedback. They might grade their teachers based on things that don't really matter, like how nice they are or how fun their classes are, instead of how well they're teaching. This wouldn't be fair to the teachers and wouldn't help them to improve.

Another reason is that students might have biases that would affect their feedback. For example, a student might grade their teacher poorly just because they don't like them, even if they're a good teacher. This wouldn't be fair to the teacher and wouldn't give an accurate picture of how well they're doing.

In conclusion, I believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers. It would help teachers to improve, make students feel more invested in their education, and give valuable feedback. However, it's also important to make sure that the feedback is fair and accurate, and that students are mature enough to give good feedback.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Some people believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers.

With its toxic chemicals, and the stress that goes along with driving ,it's no wonder why our vehicular casualty rate is so high. The answer seems to be clear,there are many advantages in reducing our car use. Not to mention the money saving opportunities and traffic reduction that come along with letting go of our beloved crutch.

The world has long bin involved in a ""love affair"" with its cars and other forms of motor transportation, and now in 2015 we are by far, paying the price.

The dangers to your personal health and the health of the environment are cringe worthy. France, being one of the most polluted ares in Europe. at one point had 147 micrograms of particulate matter in there air. As a result Pairs put a partial driving ban to clear the air and the results where drastic. In just one week the smog cleared up just enough to lift the ban. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up too 50 percent in some areas in the United states. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions. This is cold hard proof that cars are a major contribute to our carbon foot print.

Many other countries have taken the lead in ridding the world of this environmental burdon. One of the most major examples being a community in Vauban Germany. The inhabitants of this upscale community have simply given up there cars. The residents agree that the lack of cars have greatly reduced there stress. Similarly, in Bogota Colombia, they have created a set carfree day. This has encouraged other means of travel including biking, walking and skating. It's a fantastic way to lower stress and air pollution all at once. The word is now spreading through Colombia and 2 more cities have joined and municipal authorities from other countries are very excited about the event. It sparked a mass improvement leading too new sidewalks, a reduction in traffic, and more upscale businesses.

More and more people are startting to catch on. The amount of licenses registeres each year are going down drastically and people ""just dont see a need for a vehicle anymore."" A study last year showed the decress in young people driving is at 23 percent between2001 and 2009. People organize there social life or jobs around where they can take public transportation or a bike. The main point in it all is that a car is just another way to get where your going and most dont really care how they get there in the first place.

Vehicle ownership is proving to be impractical, harmful, and expensive. With the rise of pedestrian accsess, bikeing, commercial and public transportation the over use of cars is becoming obselete. We need to improve our safety and lower our emissions to keep the planet and ourselves healthy.

I am writing to you today on the subject of community service. I do not support this requirement, not because i think it is bad, but the time it would take would be too much for some students. Some students are already very busy, and adding community service projects would just make it busier, and harder on them. Some students play sports, and have practices every night, others have band rehearsals. On top of all that, they all have homework, putting required community service projects on top of all that would confuse us students, we would have trouble focussing on our academics if we have to worry about getting so many things done. I myself am in many extracurricular activities, i play many sports, i play in the band, and i sing in the choir, i have a sports practice every night, and i have homework to do after that. To me, requiring community service would set me over the limit. I myself am already extremely busy every night, and having to worry about getting my community service projects done would be too much for me to handle. i also have many friends that play many sports, and other things.

Right now, the cost of this program is just too much. Consumer PCs are not equipped to run it, which is a huge limiting factor. Next is the set up. You can't just have a single PC running it, you would need multiple due to how many kids there would be in one class. Finally, there would be so much work needed to help code in such a complex lesson for classes. Making lessons for school is tough and boring work now, imagine having to make every possible outcome for one lesson every time you wanted to teach. It would be extremely difficult.

Now don't get me wrong, this technology could be used to great extent in other fields, I just believe that now is not a good time to implement that into classrooms everywhere. It would be better to test it on a smaller scale before releasing the program. Perhaps you could test it inside of one school, or inside of one class to see how effective this would even be at getting these bored students engaged again. Because in the end, that's what its about, keeping the students engaged.

If they want to use this technology in the class, they really have to zero it in as to what it will be used for. Dr. Huang said that the program can be used to detect when a student is becoming bored or confused with a lesson, and the lesson can modify itself to help like a human instructor. But thats it, we can just have a human instructor! There's no need for that right now.

They are making it scientifically productive as the text states, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth"" this means that Venus was holding life, in the text is says ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and productive?"" so this shows that scientists are very well trying there best, and devoting hours into figuring out venus. Although many space shuttles without humans have landed on Venus, they have all burned within 2 hours, and been completely abolished! Venus can bring us many things to history along with knowledge... if there was life there, how did they live, how did they thrive, what caused Venus to not continue thriving? These questions will all be answered one day. NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus as stated in the text... NASA is testing differnet conditions doing simulations, there are more fields of technology they are looking back at! Devices that were first envisioned in the 1800s, and they played a role in the 1940s.

In conclusion, striving to meet Venus has its values, not only the insights, but human curiosity will lead them into intimidating endeavors. Travel on earth and beyon should not be limited by dangers or doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination along with innovation as the text states.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

It would help students learn better without the distractions of the classroom like friends and it would help calm people down to do more work because they won't be having any social anxiety problems because there is no social aspects. And with doing schooling from home they can finish their work with greater success because they have all of the tools at their fingertips and they aren't slowed down by the rate at which the teachers teach. While yes there are distractions inside the houses of the students like TV's, video games, their phones, and so on. It has be said by a multitude of professors¬†that taking a break from and hour of work and doing something for a little bit is helpful and can reduce the pressure of work, which in turn will make the students work better. It also can be of benefit because now students cannot be late to class resulting in missing classwork and it also means that going to the restroom doesn't take up precious¬†class time for them to do their work. While some electives like Art, Cooking classes, Wood shop, etc. would be a little bit harder to do, they still could assign projects that they have to show via video conferences, as well as being able to hold classes with video conferences.

While yes there is somethings that could go wrong like internet outage, students not doing the work cause no one is there to watch, and so on. The benefits greatly out way the the downsides, students not doing the work is something that still happens even in school, and internet outages happen all the time due to over stressing the wifi that schools have, and using technology for uses other than school all happen already and we are inside of the school building. Also with going to school their is a much higher chance of students and teachers becoming sick and having to miss school therefor missing work and becoming behind in class. With working at home both teachers and students will be safe from any potential health hazards. And even if a teacher or student is sick they still can work on all of their work from the comfort of their home without endangering the rest of the school.

In conclusion to all that is stated having classes from home via online or video conferencing is a much better solution then to coming in to school everyday.

ADFE2CDB6FF1,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that attending classes from home has numerous benefits that could be implemented by our school. While some may argue that in-person classes are necessary for a student's social and emotional development, I believe that the benefits of remote learning far outweigh any potential drawbacks.

Firstly, attending classes from home allows for a more flexible schedule. This means that students can attend classes at a time that works best for them, whether that be early in the morning or later in the evening. This flexibility can be especially beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as jobs or family responsibilities.

Secondly, remote learning can provide a more personalized learning experience. With virtual classes, students can learn at their own pace and receive individualized attention from their teachers. This can be especially beneficial for students who struggle in a traditional classroom setting or who have learning disabilities.

Thirdly, attending classes from home can help to reduce stress and anxiety. With virtual classes, students do not have to worry about the social pressures of attending school in person. This can be especially beneficial for students who struggle with social anxiety or who have been bullied in the past.

Finally, remote learning can help to reduce the spread of illness. With virtual classes, students do not have to worry about coming into contact with sick students or teachers. This can be especially beneficial during flu season or during a pandemic.

In conclusion, I believe that attending classes from home has numerous benefits that could be implemented by our school. While some may argue that in-person classes are necessary for a student's social and emotional development, I believe that the benefits of remote learning far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Our school should consider implementing virtual classes as a permanent option for students.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,7

Each of these fields has its unique methods and tools used to study and investigate the world around us. In this essay, we will explore the different topics studied in science, the methods and tools used to study them, and how science impacts people's day-to-day lives.

Biology is the study of living organisms, their structure, function, and evolution. Biologists use various tools and methods to study living organisms, such as microscopes, DNA sequencing, and experiments. Chemistry is the study of matter and its interactions with energy and forces. Chemists use various tools and methods to study matter, such as spectroscopy, chromatography, and synthesis. Physics is the study of the natural world and its interactions with matter and energy. Physicists use various tools and methods to study the natural world, such as experiments, simulations, and mathematical models. Astronomy is the study of the universe and its celestial objects. Astronomers use various tools and methods to study the universe, such as telescopes, spectroscopy, and simulations.

Science has a significant impact on people's day-to-day lives. For example, medical research has led to the development of new treatments and cures for diseases. Advances in technology have led to the creation of new devices and machines that make our lives easier and more efficient. Science has also led to the development of new materials and products that are used in everyday life, such as smartphones, cars, and computers.

Becoming a science expert requires a significant amount of time and effort. It typically takes at least four years to earn a bachelor's degree in a science-related field. After completing a bachelor's degree, individuals may pursue further education, such as a master's or doctoral degree, to become even more specialized in their field.

Scientific notation is a way of expressing very large or very small numbers using exponents. For example, the number 100,000,000,000 can be expressed in scientific notation as 1 x 10^18.

Just eleven years ago the iPhone did not exist, and yet now we have access to 3-d printers, life-saving medical advancments, and...the Facial Action Coding System?

That's right: this new technology, sometimes refered to simply as FACS and developed by Professor Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, has the incredible ability to read each and every emotion displayed on a person's face.

For instance, the invention identified da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" as being ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.""

While this demonstration of its ability is certainly impressive, we should instead think about the potential that this machine has to be a useful tool elsewhere: such as in the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System could be utilized brilliantly to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, a valuable idea that could change the way a school is run.

First of all, teachers could use this tool to test how their students react to certain lessons, topics, and concepts.

By using the FACS to gauge the class, they could identify how to modify lesson plans for future units and for the years to come.

As Dr. Huang states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'""

The teacher could access and interpret these results, or the computer itself could ""modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

The emotional information of these students could provide valuable information and instruction that would in turn give a student more confidence and a better undeerstanding of the topic at hand.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System could be used to help pupils measure the effectiveness of not only lessons, but homework assignments as well.

From a student's perpective, homework is the dreaded and unforgiving punishment that one always has to look forward to when one gets home.

If the FACS was used to measure the reactions of kids to certain assignments, the new technology could modify these assignments to better fit the needs of each individual student.

The same topics would still be taught, but not every individual learns the same way, so by using this emotions-reading innovation each student could learn and develop better connections with their current subject material.

Lastly, there are some who might say that the FACS would be useless in helping the learning proccess of a child.

Naysayers could claim that this type of instruction would never work in a classroom because a computer can't provide the same type of personal connection that a teacher can develop with a student.

However, this is exactly what the purpose of the Facial Action Coding System should be; to personally instruct a student based on that child's specific learning needs.

The computer technology itself may not be able to directly teach a new topic, but it can certainly help the proccess by identifying what methods work and which ones do not in a classroom.

In conclusion, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is an incredibly valuable tool.

This innovation can pave the way for the future of instruction, setting up a template for teaching for years to come.

Not only could the FACS be used to help teachers modify the way that they present their information in a classroom, the Facial Action Coding System could be used as an additional item to help students with their homework.

While some might say it's too impersonal to be effective, this new technology could truly be the most personal and individual type of instruction that the world has at its fingertips.

In the end, Dr. Huang said it best; ""'Most human connection is nonverbal, including emotional communication...so computers need to understand that, too.""   ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
0AA2CC0ED760,"Dear Principal,

Students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school, to be used during lunch periods and or free time. Cell phone usage has increased in the last five to ten years and is an important gadget for everyday life. People have social lives in school and cell phones are a very important way to communicate socially as well as in emergencies. Cell phones may be a distraction and can disrupt the learning environment of the class that is why it should be used during lunch hours. you may agree or disagree with my view on usage of cell phones in school , but most of the students at school agree with me. Also cell phone usage is not harmful towards the education of a student if used during parts of school time where no one is teaching.

Many people including you may think that there are so many negative point in cell phone usage during lunch but actually it really is not. If you think about it lunch is used to socialize and so is free time. So during the period of lunch, kids who are sick or on vacation can communicate with friends at school at that time, also if you are planning to go somewhere and you want tell your family beforehand you can give them a call or send a text, or if you just want to talk to someone in a different school you can if cell phone usage is allowed. there might be negatives to, but that can be easily turned positive.

Cell phones also can be disruptive during class, and we all know that if cell phones are allowed to be used there must be some rules and regulations and I have come up with some. First cell phones should not be used during class time. All phones should be placed on silent and any cell phone should not interfere with the learning environment during any class. If any of these rules are violated you may come up with your own consequences and enforce them. So please take this letter into consideration and hopefully you will listen to the voice of many kids and allow cell phone usage during lunch hours or free time.

llama_70b_v11047,"I think that students would greatly benefit from the option to attend classes from home through distance learning. There are several reasons why this is the case.

Firstly, distance learning provides students with greater flexibility and autonomy over their learning schedule. Many students have family or work commitments that make it difficult for them to attend traditional classes. With distance learning, they can complete their coursework at a time that suits them best, without having to compromise on their other responsibilities.

Secondly, distance learning allows students to learn in a comfortable and familiar environment. For some students, traditional classrooms can be intimidating or stressful, especially for those who struggle with social anxiety or other mental health issues. By attending classes from home, students can learn in a setting that they feel most comfortable in, which can help them better focus and retain information.

Thirdly, distance learning can be particularly beneficial for students who live in remote or rural areas, where access to traditional schools may be limited. With distance learning, these students can still receive a quality education without having to travel long distances or relocate to a different area.

Finally, distance learning can be more cost-effective for students, as they can save money on transportation and other expenses associated with attending traditional classes.

Of course, there are also potential drawbacks to distance learning, such as the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. However, with the use of video conferencing and other online tools, students can still engage with their teachers and classmates in real-time, and build meaningful relationships with them.

Overall, I believe that distance learning is a valuable option for students, as it provides greater flexibility, comfort, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. With the advancement of technology, I believe that distance learning will become an increasingly popular choice for students in the future.",1,llama_70b_v1,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

That ""star"" is actually Venus. It's so close to Earth that we can actually see it. This intrugues many astronomers and other scientists because it triggers their curiosity. It brings much interest to many people such as the author of this passage. The author of this article suggest that studying Venus is a worth persuit despite the dangers it presents.

Although there are many dangers to studying Venus, there is also a plus side to it. If scientists can build a machine that allows us to get closer to objects on Venus, we could take them back to Earth (paragraph 7). If we could do this, it would help us gain more knowledge on the atmosphere and ground conditions of the planet and help scientists learn how to get humans closer to possibly getting to Venus one day. Human curiosity will likely lure us into many equally intimidating endeavors. For example, in the text it even talks about how far we have come with computers. Knowing this, we should take advantage of our curiosity. imagination, and innovation. This would allow all people to have a better insight of Earth's twin planet, Venus.

In conclusion, scientists have come a long way from the very beginning. Astronomers are inventing marvelous machines that last up to 3 weeks even in horrific weather condition simulators.

The cars still require human assitstance in difficult situations that the driver can't handle. But is it a good idea? Can we rely on computers to do something that can be dangerous? The answer is no.

Humans have faults. So do computers. A computers doesn't have the traits it needs to be able to drive someone. Not to mention, the whole process of making an almost driverless car is expensive. There simply isn't enough money to manufacter that many cars to drag people around.

Another issue is the driving itself. The cars they are testing today do not have certain abilities that humans do, such as parking, driving in difficult traffic, or going around accidents. Of curse they have sensors to alert the driver. But how alert will they be? A car can drive itself for most of the time, so why pay attention? It could be very dangerous if the human at the wheel isn't alert. Accidents will be prone to happen, and there may even be more accidents than we have now.

A present problem that is also important is traffic law. Trafic laws are written to make the assumption that a safe human driver is in control at all times and is keeping themselves and the pasengers safe. Places such as California, Nevada, florida, and the District of Colombia even outlawed the testing of computer driven cars. This proves as a giant red flag of if we should have computer driven cars or not. The manufacturers assume the laws will be changed in the future. But if there is an accident, is the driver or creator of fault? The creator of course. There's no doubt that in advertising the car, the manufacturers promised safety and reliability. But that didn't happen, and the driver wasn't at fault. It was the computer for not doing what it was supposed to do.

In conclusion, driverless cars controlled by computers is a bad idea. It is expensive, dangerous, unreliable, and shouldn't be tested for.       ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
83AE9B85F6FD,"The Benefits of Online Schooling

From lack of transportation, disabilities or feeling unsafe, many students are forced to stay home and miss out on valuable learning opportunities. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it revokes the need for transportation routes, allows students with injuries or disabilities to participate and allows students to feel safe while learning.

Many areas and school districts are fortunate enough to provide school parking and bus routes for their students. However, many times students need to make an extraneous effort simply to get transportation to school. Many students in my school district need to be driven to their nearest bus stop to even be able to ride for an hour to attend their local high school. Inclement weather or lack of a ride forces many of my school mates to miss class. These absences can be counteracted with the introduction of online classes. Students will benefit from online courses and curriculum without having to worry about having their transportation needs met. Students will be able to participate in an online classroom and engage with others without having to step out of their own home. Weather or lack of a ride forces many bright students to miss out on critical learning opportunities because of circumstantial needs. These aforementioned situations are common around the country and the introduction of online classes will alleviate these unfortunate absences.

Many schools outside of the country don't provide transportation services similar to the US. Students in Germany take the metro to get to school and many other students are forced to ride trains or local buses to their high schools. This may cause many students to feel unsafe and administer a feeling of fear with going to school. In many cases, girls feel unsafe to ride local buses and trains alone due to fear of sexual assault or kidnap. Rape and sexual assault are horrid things to think about but are often times reality for many females (and males) on public transportation. Online schooling offers a way for students to take classes online without having to worry about these issues. It gives students a chance to learn without worrying about their safety and the safety of others.

Teenagers with disabilities or critical injuries will benefit from online schooling because it gives them a chance to participate in an everyday classroom setting without worrying about commute in between classes and bullying from others. I am so thankful that I am fortunate enough to attend such an inclusive and disability friendly school, however, it is important to recognize that not all schools are like this. Bullying is a major issue within the public school system and many times students with disabilities become easy targets. These students are deserving of the same educational opportunities as everybody else and online classes offer that platform. Adding on, online classes revoke the need for commute between classes. There are times in which students in wheelchairs have trouble getting to class due to the overcrowded hallways and bustling of students. Schools with two to more stories also pose a problem of commute if the elevator breaks. These cases are solved with online schooling because students will no longer have to face these issues. Online classes will benefit teenagers with disabilities because they alleviate the potential threat of bullying and the need for commute between classes.

Online schooling is a powerful and new technological advance that needs to be addressed. It will aid students with transportation needs, revoke unsafe feelings and aid students with disabilities. Others may argue that although being able to attend online classes provides a platform that solves transportation needs, it poses the threat of students falling behind due to lack of a physical teacher. Although this is a reasonable¬†concern, there is no need to worry. Students will be able to work with teachers online and there will still be teacher guidance within these classes. Online classes still have a grade book¬†and many times, these classes offer live calls/chats with the teachers. Students will be able to work on their own time and still maintain grades. Online schooling is a benefit to students everywhere. It grants students unimaginable opportunities because it helps those with tranportation¬†needs, aids with providing a feeling of safety and improves conditions for students with disabilities.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3
7BBCDFAA20C3,"A common phrase teachers enjoy using is ""Ask three before me"". This phrase is the same way with receiving advice. Asking others before the final decision is an important choice to make. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, so there are more options when asking for opinions, advice will be different from one person to another, and learning plays a big role for making better choices.

First off, there are more options when seeking opinions. For example; more people, more choices. If there is a situation of being unsure of what option to take, there are many peers to go to for advice, opening more options.

as well as more options, there is also no absolute wrong or right answer. People automatically believe that there is only one right choice to make, but in most cases that is not true because of the many paths people can choose to go along. Seeing others' views can also help when making better choices. When asking for advice, others will most likely have a different picture in mind than others. To sum it up, more choices will be available when asking others for opinions.

Secondly, advice will vary from one person to another. The type of advice will be different depending on the person. Going to the right peer for advice is extremely important, rather than going to a bunch of random people for opinions. Another important factor of advice is that it is for consideration. Advice is not a requirement. At the end of the day, it is still the persons decision to make, whether or not they'll make the right choice or not. Most importantly, advice can help in daily lives. using others advice will not only help in the moment, but also in the future. Overall, advice will vary, depending on the person.

Lastly, learning is a big part of receiving opinions from others when seeking advice. Hearing what others have to say is important for learning good choices. Sometimes, it is hard to learn from the past without someones advice or opinion. as well as that, people are most definitely capable of learning from their previous mistakes. After receiving opinions and thoughts from others, people can learn what they did differently in the past, and correct it. the last big part of the learning section is that we can take others' opinions and learn a life lesson from them. having other opinions is important when realizing past mistakes. In the end, learning will always be a big role in making a better choice.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions will help people make better choices. There are more options to choose from, advice to take, and lessons to learn from. In the future, we should always ask others for their opinion on the choices we make, depending on the situation. receiving advice is extremely important for making better choices than before. We can learn from our mistakes from the past by hearing what others have to say. We should always speak to more than one person for advice.   ¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,7

this is your fellow student STUDENT_NAME and i am asking if all of 8A should perform community service because it will be a great way to earn point on our scholarships and since it is the last semester i think that we all should do it and it all so teaches us how to help others but some students don't wanna do it because they say that's they don't wana spend there pressures time doing it or they have to much stuff to do or maybe there sell fish but some people do wana do it. we need more people to help our world .i think that you should reward the people that do the community service a party because we don't have to do it and plus we need more people in my community service project which is helping find lost dogs and helping the shelter kids with a can food drive and a clothing drive for them because they don't have a lot to begin with . i think it would be a very important roll .so may you please make an anousment tomorrow reforming to it that's all i wanted to ask. have a nice day!

A055576C0F9E,"My name is Generic_Name. I am going to take a position about self-reliance, whether or not about if should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters. I honestly think that seek guidance from experts is better, because you can ask them about how they did to accomplish their goals and also they have more experience about life.

First, guidance from experts it can be much better, because experts can give more options, more ideas. Also you can ask them about what you need in life to be success. Also ask them about their life, how they did to accomplish their goals. Because if we are in any situation that we know we could not do it alone , we should ask them about any idea that they will give to us.

Second, those people they know almost everything about life, they could tell you whats steps you need to follow to achieve. As we know, billionaires people worked hard to be success, even if they failed something, even if life make them week, they never give up. they keep trying and trying until they make their dreams comes truth. thats why seek guidance is important for someone that want a better life.

Finally, in life we need help, even if we say that we dont need we need it. Because we can not do everything by our self. Thats why we should ask for help with people that can teach us about life. People that will give us tips to be success in life, because they have more experience and also because they know almost about everything.

Sincerely,

97AD49AE2944,"Could you imagine only having one person to ask all your advice and questions to? I don't think I could ever imagine that because I believe that seeking multiple opinions for advice can best help a person to make the best choice.

When I get multiple opinions I can get a different point of view on my choices, I can make sure the choice I am making is the best choice by learning from other people, and it makes me more open minded to things I haven't tired before. I do think that you also shouldn't just get your opinion from anyone, especially in today's society with social media, but I do think that having multiple opinions to come back to is truly important.

When I get multiple opinions for advice I can get a different outlook and perspective of my own opinion at hand. I think that if I only asked the same person for advice I would become small minded and my actions would reflect that. My choices would always be influenced by that person and I would lack understanding of others. It also makes me realize things I never knew. For example, when I was doing course selections for high school this year I did not know what science class to take. The county and my science teacher do not support taking biology in freshman year; I, however, asked a friend of mine in high school what it was like since she was taking the class freshman year. She told me that it was not impossible, but just a lot of work you need to be committed to do. I am glad that I got another opinion from her because It helps me to realize that it isn't an impossible course to take which my teacher made me believe. I think getting different advice also gives you a diverse point of view of people and their lives. Another example I have is about my grandma. My grandparents grew up during a war and have different opinions on things than others. One thing my grandma hates to do is waste food. Always growing up I knew that I shouldn't waste food and if I was ever getting rid of old food, I should do it when grandma's not home. While at school though I notice that there are people who waste food and it's normal for them. The different opinions of people affect their values and lifestyle and I think it is important to understand them.

Getting multiple opinions can help you to verify your choice is the best one. When I'm making a difficult choice I usually seek advice from those close to me. For example, when I was deciding whether or not to apply to TJ my mom's opinion was absolutely yes. I felt that this was my only choice until I told my grandma. My grandma told me that when my mom had went to TJ she had constantly been stressed. My grandma said that she did not want to push me to go to TJ and only go If I wanted to. Having more than my mom's advice was useful when I did end up deciding to apply because it made me aware of the choice I was making. When you get multiple opinions it bring up things you may have overlooked. When a doctor has a patient who has an issue that they are not sure what it is or the best way to treat them, they'll get a second opinion.

Getting a second opinion from another doctor can help get the patient the best treatment for their particular situation or condition. One person alone could look over minor details that another person would not. My last point is that you may find the answer you were truly looking for. When my mom was looking into getting new floors, she did not just get one opinion. She went around and got different advice on the type of wood, style and color. She got multiple opinions until she got the choice that she truly loved and was happy with. I believe that getting different opinions can help to solidify the choice you are making as the best one you could choose.

Getting more than one opinion makes you more open minded to things you haven't tried before. An example I have is when I went shopping with my friends. While we were shopping we picked out outfits for each other. I got to try on stuff I never would have chosen on my own or with my sister. I found things I absolutely¬†loved that I would not have tried without their advice. When you get different opinions you also widen your option of choices to choose from. Five years ago when my family was getting my current dog, we went looking on pet websites. There was a pet store we always went to and decided to maybe get a puppy from there. It wasn't until we found out from our friends who had got a puppy from there that many dogs from that store get sick. It was basically a puppy mill. My mom went and found reviews for the store online. She found a review that said a certain breeding place in Maryland was the place to go instead. Taking that lady's advice we drove down to Maryland and got my dog who is still with me today. She is one of the best choices I have ever made and i'm grateful that we found her. I don't think that we would have went to this specific breeder without the advice from reviews and our friends. Getting different opinions can affect even more simple things in daily life. My example is ordering off a menu. As I get older, instead of just ordering the things my parents tell me to get, I may ask the waiter or a person who goes there often for their opinion on the best stuff there. This gets me to try new things and makes my meals more fun. Getting different opinions gives you more variety in life based on others' life experience.

All in all, I still think that getting multiple opinions on different advice can help someone to make the best choice possible. When I seek different opinions I can get a different view on the topic, it makes me sure my choice is the best one by learning from others' stories and opinions. It also makes me more prone to trying new things. I think that you should always get advice from different people because they all have different experiences in life. I know that even in the future I will still want to have different opinions to be able to reflect and learn from.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

He tells us that for decades we have been wanting to find out more about Venus but its just complicated the temperature and eveyrhting about it. he thinks that it is important to learn more about the planet so that later in life we could send people and build things there for example the hovering vechiles he talked about.

The author suggests that studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it present because out of all the other planet in the solar sydtem Venus is the that is more like earth. It talks about how dangerous it is how the machines that they send to Venus dont last long because of things are in Venus. Obvisouly he or she thinks that its worth it because the author tells us how ""researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" He says that ""our travels on earth and beyond shouldnt be limited by dangers and doubts but should expand to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

The author had said that most likely probably at one point Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various of life, just like Earth. I mean in my opinion that would be smart to learn more about the planet because we never know the world might come to its end and we need to be prepared to move in somewhere new. It has some features that are analogous to those on Earth, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as velleys, mountains and craters that furthermore Venus might be our nearest option for planetary visits.

The autor want or tells us that NASA has one particulary idea for sending humans to study venus.

Walking or riding bike is the cleanest way to do all these things at once. The more people that are not using cars, the more accidents will be prevented. And there is no limit to how many people you can walk with. There's no cost to walk, you just do it. It's something the whole family can do together and enjoy the journey somewhere rather than being on their devices. In addition, fuel is not emmiting forom your body into the atmosphere rupturing the Ozone creating all this Global Warming. Creating a world where transportation vehicles are obsolete will nt only benefit the people of this world, but the planet itself, and for the future generations.

Accidents would be almost nonexistent if we were to gert rid of motherized vehicles. In the article, ""in German suburb, life goes on without cars"" the author talks about how there are already cities in the world that have not banned cars, but choose not to use them. The people in those areas are close to no accidents at all. If there are no cars in the road then how can there be a car accident? The way the Germans started to remove cars forom the road is by removing parking lots. There are only two anywhere in that suburb and they are so inconvient.

Any doctor in the world no matter how young, or where they live will tell their patients that exercise is the only way to stay healthy, energized, and feeling young throughout their life. Without cars getting forom one place to another will require another means for transportation. Now either wait for the bus and be late or wake up a little earlier and walk or ride your bike. It's cheap and effective not only for you but the environment.

Fuel creates a gas that later rips open holes in the Ozone layer. Creating Global Warming which then in turn leads to higher taxes to allow for more money to be used in research to save it. Or you can take action now and save up for a bike rather than a car. It takes less management and doesnt take fuel. Just good old man power. It's tragic in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", ""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue."" this world is what we are leaving our children and their children to live in. Make sure you leave it better than when you came.

In the four articles they all talk about the negative in driving rather than the positive. The reason is because there are more negatives to the industrialization of a car rather than just going back to the way our ancestors used to be. Even our young as our vary own parents are amazed at how much damage this generation is doing to themselves and everything around them. It is the result of inventions like the automobile. Vehicles are efficient in some way, but you might prefer to take a bit more time here and there to allow that you can be there when your children have children.",0,train_essays,,2
F531D21A72F6,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that mistakes and failures are valuable learning experiences that can help us grow as individuals and reach our goals. When we make mistakes, it is important to stay positive and motivated in order to overcome the challenges and learn from them.

One of the most important things we can do when we encounter mistakes and failures is to stay positive. It is easy to get discouraged when things don't go as planned, but it is important to remember that mistakes are a natural part of the learning process. When we stay positive, we are more likely to approach the situation with an open mind and a willingness to learn. This can help us to identify the root cause of the problem and come up with solutions to overcome it.

Another key aspect of using mistakes and failures as learning experiences is staying motivated. When we are motivated to learn and grow, we are more likely to put in the effort to overcome challenges and make the most of our mistakes. This can be especially important when we are working towards a goal, as it can help us to stay focused and committed to our objectives.

I have encountered many mistakes and failures in my life, and each one has helped me to become a better person. For example, when I was in the fifth grade, I struggled with math. I found it difficult to understand the concepts and struggled to keep up with my classmates. However, instead of giving up and accepting my limitations, I sought help from my teacher and a tutor. With their guidance, I was able to improve my understanding of math and eventually catch up with my classmates. This experience taught me the importance of seeking help when I need it and never giving up on my goals.

Another example of a failure that helped me to grow as a person was when I applied for a scholarship to a summer camp. I worked hard on my application, but when I received the news that I had not been selected, I was disappointed and felt like I had failed. However, instead of giving up, I decided to use the experience as an opportunity to learn and improve. I sought feedback from my teachers and mentors, and used their suggestions to improve my application for the next year. In the end, my hard work paid off and I was selected for the scholarship the following year. This experience taught me the importance of using failures as a chance to learn and grow, and to never give up on my goals.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,6
B49D86AC2062,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm? its a 50% chance you will be successful,reason for this is that some people give up too easily,some people get tired of failing and failing again. You dont need to fail many times before you get successful.

Some people never put in work to be successful as they are today some just became successful out the cut. Right now the world we live in you dont really need to put in alot of effort,there are many ways of being successful for example we have social media! Social media now has a big impact in the world we live in.

Scientists are perfect examples of this statement. A scientist can start an experiment and fail over and over again till they get they expected the results. Students can fail a test over and over again but whiles he's failing hes learning from his mistakes to pass his test.

Working on something new or getting used to something new,you wont get it right the first time you would mess up or fail but once you keep getting used to it you learn from your mistake which helps you to become successful.

7A143C2BC7F9,"Cars are not always convienent. I've been asked to inform citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage. The main advantages of limiting car usage are decrese of pollution, less stress, and promotion of alternative transportaion.

First of all, one main advantage of limiting car usage is decrease of pollution. In the article 'Paris bans driving due to smog' by Robert Duffer he says ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The pollution had gotten out of control, and had to be decreased. Duffer also states ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog . . ."" As a result of the ban, pollution decreased. Limiting car usage can decrease pollution.

In addition, another main advantage of limiting car usage is less stress. In the passage 'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota' by Andrew Selsky, Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress . . ."" Also in the article 'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars' by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a media trainer and mother of two says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Limiting car usage can cause less stress.

Lastly, another main advantage of limiting car usage is the oppurtunity to promote alternative transportation. Selsky continues and says ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation . . ."" The author goes on to say "" The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota"" Their attempt for promotion of alternative transportation was a success, even with violators that faced a $25 fine. Limiting car usage can help the promotion of alternative transportation.

In conclusion, I was asked to inform citizens about the advantages of limiting car usages. The main advantages of limiting car usage are decrease of pollution, less stress, and promortion of alternative transportation. Limiting car usage is very beneficial.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
9C488536A51B,"The world of technology is changing everyday thanks to scientist around the world. These scientist create new ways of live and helping. Scientist have now created a technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" which enables people to find out what emotions others have. People are debating on whether or not we shout use this facial system and I believe we should, here are my reasons on why.

""The facial expresions for each emotion are universal,"" according to professor Dr. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute. What he mean is that there are a lot of emotions in this world and several expressions can be used for the same emotion. If we're using the same expression for several different emotions how will we know how someone feels. With the new emotio software we can tell what emotions or mixed emotions someone has. This would be helpful in a classroom because ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts."" If a computer can recognize that then it could help can the lesson into something more effective for students. Some students aren't going to come right out and admit they're bored or confused, they sit in the chairs the whole class period not admitting to either of those emotions. If we had computers that can recognize emotions then there would be no students sitting in class dumbfounded or bored out of their minds.

There has been many times where students zoned out because they were too bored to pay attention to the teacher. Not many teachers can tell when a student is bored unless they zone out of a disscusion or presentation. So if we had facial systems then we could have a computer readjust the disscusion to make it more entertain. We could also find out if someone is bored or confused ourselves by if there's a fake sideways smile or if our ""frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises our eyebrows (paragraph two)"", showing our confusion.

The world could make a difference in the classroom if we got the ""Facial Action Coding System"" in all classrooms. No more confused students, no more being bored. This is why I believe having facial reading technology in the classroom would be of value for many people. ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
D3D61E214627,"Dear Principal:

Recently you have stated that you are considering two policies when it comes to cell phones in our school. You believe that either us students can bring our cell phones to school and use them during our lunch and other free periods, as long as they are turned off during class time, or we are simply not allowed to have them at all. I believe that we should be allowed to bring our cell phones to school and use them during our lunch periods and free periods, for these three reasons.

First off, you have to consider who this rule affects. We are teenagers. Teenagers love their technology and their cell phones. I saw a comic once that said, ""Teenagers: the only species of animal on Earth with a cell phone directly wired to their nervous system."" We will be happier if we get to have use of our cell phones. If we are happier, this could lead to better grades, too. You may be worried about us using them during class, but if you had us keep them in our lockers until our free period, you wouldn't have to worry.

Next, we could call our parents much easier. I have to call my mom all the time and tell her that track practice has been extended another hour, or that she has to come pick me up because play rehearsal is canceled. I don't call her just for my extra-curricular activities, but also to ask her if she could bring in the lunch I forget occasionally. If cell phones were allowed in school, it would just make our whole parent-child communication easier.

Lastly, it would make it easier to talk with our friends. If I can't find my friend during lunch, I can just shoot off a quick text to her and ask her where she is instead of wandering the school, looking for her. Or, if she wants to tell me a secret about the boy she finds cute, she could just text it to me instead of whispering it and having everyone around us go, ""What? What are you telling her? Tell me!"" As well, one of my best friends moved a year ago and now lives in Orange County, California. Its hard to find times to talk, because when I'm getting up she's asleep, when I'm out of school she's in, and when I'm done with dinner she is still in her after school activities. But if I could text her during my lunch period, it would be much easier to stay in touch with her.

Therefore, For these three reasons- us students wanting to use our phones, communicating with our parents, and talking with our friends- I hope you can see what the benefits are of letting us use our cell phones in school during our lunch and free periods. Can you see that there would be no real benefits of taking away our cell phones? It will not help us.

4EE3AC599905,"You hear it all, throughout breaking news; to protesters trying to make a difference in our world. Pollution is dangerous and people don't fully understand the costly effects to our everyday living. Transportation is a way of means by transitioning from one place to another. The most popular way of transportation is the vehicle. A fast and easy way to get to your destination with just a turn of the key, or in this case now-a-days, the click of a button.

Acres of land being towed to create bigger roads, or streets because of the vast majority of people using cars to get around. With each car means more gas or diesel, more gas equals more money, and more pollution. Our atmosphere can only take so much from the faulty mistakes we choose to do everyday. Places like Paris and suburbs in Germany are becoming more aware of how much cars can effect our Earth.¬† After days of near record pollution Paris decided to enforce a 'partial driving ban' to clear some of the air in the global city. The way they enforced this was motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home. The same would apply for the odd numbered license plates the following day. After this, smog and congestion decreased by 60 percent in the capital of France. Other places like Bogota, Columbia is having 'car free day' where millions of people would enjoy their day outside hiking, biking, and taking buses for work during the day. These decisions and actions cleared the streets in Bogota and avoided jams, leaving the people to have a nice day enjoying the outdoors. Carlos Arturo says ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

This doesn't mean give up cars all in all. Rather, limit the use of driving your car. America's love affair with vehicles seem to be dulling down. After 2005, the number of miles driven started to decrease. Part of the explanation to this lies in the recession, because tight budget Americans could'nt afford new cars, and the unemployed were'nt going to work. Sociologists believe if these patterns of decreasing numbers of car owners and people driving-- that it will have beneficial outcomes for carbon emissions and the enviroment. On the opposing side this has a negative effect for the car industries.

The positive effects will benifit future generations to come, with clean air to breathe and a fresh start. By limiting car usage there would be less traffic jams, more people getting in touch with their surroundings and even losing 3 to 5 pounds while they're at it. Transportation is a way of means by transitioning from one place to another, it doesn't always have to be a vehicle with so many other options you can choose from. Make a difference in the world, one less car at a time.        ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

You are considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a B average. My views on this possible change is that I think that the students should have at least a B average to participate in outer school activities such as sports. I say this because if a student wants to be a part of our school and wants to support our school, then they should have reasonable grades. In my house hold my brother and I are not allowed to get grades lower than a B. Students who want to do sports and activities should strive to make good grades. If you change the policy, then students may take education serious and start trying to achieve the grades to participate in sports. For example, if I did not have a goal or an expectation to reach, then I do not think my grades would be what they are today.

There is also one downfall for changing the policy. If you make the policy stricter than some students may not want to do sports and some students may become over weight. I hope you take my letter into great consideration and change the school policy so that students must have a B average to continue participating in sport activities.

8AD96DB8DD9F,"As any student can attest, the value of knowledge is immense. Knowledge increases our understanding of the world and our ability to navigate it. However, for me, imagination has proven to be even more valuable. It provides an invaluable resource when seeking to understand something or solve a problem.

Take reading books for example. While knowledge has helped me to reiterate factual information about a certain subject, it doesn't always provide insight into more complex ideas or provide a deeper level of understanding. It is only through imagination that I can truly engage and explore an idea. It is my imagination that helps me to open up possibilities, to connect ideas, to think outside the box, and to see the bigger picture or benefit. 

This same benefit of imagination carries over to my studies and learning. When going over a particularly difficult subject, I often find myself drawing upon my imagination for inspiration. Taking a step back and looking at the assignment in a new light or in a different way can often lead me down some interesting paths that I would have otherwise missed. Imagination opens up the ability to apply the knowledge I have acquired in creative and innovative ways.

The power of imagination cannot be overstated. It is the force that guides our learning process and allows us to form meaningful relationships with the material we are studying. Imagination allows us to go beyond the facts and move into understanding. That is why I believe that imagination is far more important than knowledge.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Write an essay exploring the idea that imagination is more important than knowledge.

First, driverless car world be good for make a beter safe cars. At the start the car may not seem safe at first,but that why the we can just keep making them.

Next, technologey well get beter. Your world today is constedly evoling, we got the hoverbored, Iphone7 Ps4&Xbox1,just a lot of new things all together,so why can't we have driverless cars? I think people asked that same question that why in 2013 the BMW annouced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". The BMW company is readey to move on with the world and with new technology,why not follow in their footsteps.

Lastly, it a great way to get new driver ready for the rode. I now some people lean beter though audio and that what you can get though driverless cars. In the article they said something about google talking to you when yoy need to take control sometime.

I'm aware that you are questioning weather to make community service for the students at this school mandatory or not. When making your decision, it's important to remember that either way, someone will not be happy. Still, you must make a choice. I have my own opinion on the matter, and I'd like to share it with you before you decide weather to implement this rule or not.

At the current time, many of my fellow students perform community service regularly. The help the people and the world around them. However, other students oppose community service. This isn't because they want to make the world a better place, I'm sure we all want that, but it's a matter of time. The teens at this school, and everywhere else, would much rather do something else that the enjoy more. If they have free time, they aren't going to think to themselves, ""Well I have nothing to do for the next two hours. I'll go help out at the animal shelter!"" To me, this is a disappointment.

Implementing this rule would have a very positive effect on the students here at this school. It would encourage teens to help out their community. You'd be teaching them to donate their time to make the world better. Even after they've left this school, they'd continue to help people. This rule will teach the students to help people, making better people for the future. Think of the rule as training wheels on a bike. We'll need them to start, but eventually we won't. One thing to remember is that everyone wouldn't be happy instantly. Many students would moan and groan, but that would only last a few weeks, maybe a month. A month of complaining for a lifetime of compassion seems like a good deal doesn't it?

Despite my opinion, the choice is yours. Still, I strongly advise you to review what I've said and take it into account. I know you will make the best decision.

008B503940C9,"The face was not created by aliens on mars. The things that make it appear as a face are the shadows and the quality of which the picture was taken. The Face is just a rock formation, the fact that the shadows make it look like a face is simply just a coincidence.

If you look at the picture of the Face, you can see the black shadows on the figure, if you were to remove those shadows, it would most likely not look like a face anymore. The passage says ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadowss that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The passage also says ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Key word, illusion.

The original picture shown in the passage wasn't taken at a very high quality. The passage states ""And so on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web servers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This paragraph clarifies that the low quality original picture, along with the shadows, is what made it appear as a face. The Face is just a rock formation that looks like a face, nothing more than that.

All in all, the Face was not made by aliens and it is just a rock formation with a cool looking shadow. Though these alien theories are fun to believe in, the alien theory of this case is false.             ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
CD7476870567,"Have you ever thought of limiting your car usage or just stop driving period? Well you might. Today the average joe driving to work filling the air with pollution, but tommorw he could be riding a bike or any type of public transportation. Limiting your car usage is very important, you could save the world and it's pretty efficient.

To begin, the earth is filled with pollution, but scientist have been trying to find a solution and I think we just found it. In ""German suburb, life goes on without cars"" Elisabeth Rosenthal writes about a small upscale community called Vauban, Germany where the residents are suburban pioneers. What made them pioneers was that they had given up their cars. Places like Vauban are becoming a trend in Europe, the U.S, and elsewhere to seperate subrban life from auto use as a component of a movement stated in the text as ""Smart Planning."" Also in Paris a law was passed, banning all cars for a couple days as presented in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Rober Duffer states that ""Congestion was down 60 percent...after five-days of intesifying smog."" This idea to solve the worlds pollution problem is working.

Furthermore, this idea is also efficient. The idea need you to reduce your car usage and revert to other methods of travel, like bikes, skateboards, and public transportation. For example in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" Andrew Selsky writes ""millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" this event has going on for a while it's creating a revolution. This event has ""seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths."" What about America? Well recent studies suggest thet Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by as stated in another Elisabeth Rosenthal article ""The end of car culture"". Also the article says ""If the pattern persists...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Only the future will tell where this solution is headed.

In conclusion to, the fact that an idea like this has been around for years and the amount of progress it has is amazing. The polution and green house problems are going out the window and were to blame for it.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
6B5FA24D86FC,"Dear Principal,

As a student, of course, I would not agree with the ""no cell phone policy."" Students are always on there phone's, and quite recently, there have been several incidents regarding a cell phone. examples like: texting in class, the phones going off in class and being a disruption. I do understand your concern for a change. IF you do allow policy 1 (allow the students to bring the phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.) I believe there should be some modifications involved.

I am in agreement to both policies, but I am more along the lines of policy one. Policy one is stating that the use of cell phones are okay to be using in school to a minimum. I am concerned that students would take advantage of this offer, so minor consequences should be involved, example: referral. Another concern I have is if the students forget or do not have time to turn off and back on there cell phones between passing periods. I am not concerned about the lunch period however, you have about thirty minutes to make sure your cell phone is turned OFF before entering a classroom.

Technology is at it's greatest in this century, there is practically every device you could think of. Including a device that will ruin reception in the classroom. If the student's phone is not turned off before entering the classroom, it would be no use to use, the device would cut all reception. I do believe this should be placed in every classroom. This will cut all worries of your phone going off in class or a disruption from a text.

Although it may lower all those causes, it will also lower the amount of referrals being given out to the students who do chose to text in class and get caught. As for the students who do have there phone's out and get caught with them, a referral should be given.

I do not think phone's should be allowed during passing periods. You will have at least five minutes to turn your phone on, send a text or two, and turn it back on, and still be on time to class. I think it will cut into passing time. You will see a trend of students being late to there class because they are caught up in sending a text rather than being focused to get to class on time.

With a few perfecting modifications, I do in fact believe this policy will be do-able. I am in full agreement with the policy, with the changes applied. Phones should be located on the student incase of any emergency, they will be able to contact parent/guardian or 911. Regardless, I do NOT agree with policy 2 in ANY way.

Sincerely,

321FA7E39731,"I vote yes that we should keep the electoral college in. Its easy to do because you don't have to count¬† them up yourself. I facts that these four guys even like it (Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,and Bob Dole).

Do you know over 60% of voters would prefer voteing direct election? We need more people to vote the more voters the better it will look,we don't need to beat aound the tree. This make people feel better to vote then doing it another way. So want u like you vote to go right in so you know your vote count?

The only con of doing this is we don't know who did it. You want think that really matter but it does because some can cheat for somebody. The state legislatures been picking electors since 1960. In Kennedy days when he was running he got cheated out his vote,so he lost but they done fixed all that things going well.

This is five reasons the keep the method of voting like that.#1 fact there is a certainty of outcome by that i mean it show the popular votes. In 2012 Obama received 61.7% vote and Romney popualr vote was 51.3%.#2 is he/she have to be everybody president. He/she can't play sides like her cant just do the most for the south havt to be fair fot all of them.#3 swing states by sayig that the winner-take-all. So whoever win they take it all the awarding and everything else.#4 big states with big states the elsctoral collegethe balance all it out by the popualr votes. So it compare as a small states so u bout say its even. Last #5 it can stop and avoid run-offs when Nixon and Clinton was running it was a tied at 43%.

So do you understand where i'm coming from with this. So keep it easy just let the electoral college stay around. If it was left up to you will you keep it around because i know i will. Thats how i feel bout it even know it want never mean nothing.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
8452DCB2606B,"Air polution, no money, and death, Oh my! Everywhere you go there are going to be cars. One of the most helpful and loving inventions of our time, it gets us from place to place in a short amount of time. But is getting to where you need to go faster really worth it? Money, safety, and protection to our environment all play huge roles when it comes to cars. The population of our world grows every year, which means more cars... Which means more air polution, more deaths, more of spending your money.

Owning a car also comes a lot of things. Money for gas, money for parts that stop working, etc. With gas prices up and down all the time, we find ourselves spending way too much money just to fill up our vehicle. You would be amazed at how much more money you would have if you weren't spending on gas and other things your car needs. It also requires no excercise at all, which is really a disadvantage to our health. Imagine what a simple difference can make. If we all walked or biked to where we needed to go, we're doing something great for our bodies and our environment. Not only is it jeopordizing our health, but our own environment's, too! Every single car and every single drive is polluting our air. Do we really want to end up like Beijing, China? As of now, they are known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. What about safety? Car crashes are one of the most common deaths. Such as two major factors, texting while drving and driving under the influence. No matter what state you're in, when you get behind that wheel you hold a big responsibility. So is putting your life on the line really worth it?

By limiting car usage, we can make a difference throughout the world. We can lower stress, death rate, air pollution, spendings, and so much more. If ONE day of the Day Without Cars in Columbia made a difference, imagine what a whole year, or years, could make. There are so many better options to get to where you need to go other than cars, such as bikes. So what if you don't get there as fast as you would in a car? The point is, you're still getting there. You're also not putting you and other's lives on the line.

A44F6859B4D8,"Do you think that we should have school activites? I think we should because it could possible benefit kid in learning. Which means helping kids with better learning that is gong to benefit them by getting up and doing an activity that might help refresh their minds instead of the kid siting in class all day learning about something that might not be instresting to them and they might start to day dream and them not learning anything. I think the school should have activities for students.

firstly, It would benefit a childs learning by refreshing their minds. According to a studies done by Virginia Techs mental studies, states that 74% of students fall asleep or day dream and stop listening and the other 26% of students listen and learn because they are involed in activities that help refresh there minds and givings them time to thing. What this means is that 74% of student stop listening do to being board or just no intrested but the other 26% is in a club or sport that helps that student refresh their mind and helps them think so they are ready for classes and other work that is needed to be done.

secondly, depeneding on the activity it could help build a skill in a student. according to sports news website on collage sports, suggests that 25% of sports players in collage sports that train hard and keep lead to building skills that could help down the road and the other 75% of collage players that dont train hard and just sit around learn how to succed through failer. This means that the collage students that try their best are the one mostly building skills that will help them succed and the other 75% who dont try learn skills through not putting more work into it knowing what they need to try to improve on to become better.

thirdly, trying something new could help find things you might like. according to a studies done at a Virgina univitsy, suggest that 83% of the kid in school that had join club or sports had found a hobby that they enjoy doing and the other 17% of the students that took a club or a sport didn't or could find an intrest in that subject of activities. this mean that students found new hobby that enjoy to do in school when they have tine to do it and the students that didn't find a hobby that they dont enjoy probably dropped out of the club or the sport they were in.

the other point of view, It would be another thing added to a students list and another thing they would have to stress about. According Anderson shores a mental health studies doctor, states that 65% of students that have something else to add to their scedules stresses them do to having a bussy scedule already and the 35% percent of the other students do get stressed out do to not having a bussy scedule or they have good time management. This means that the students that have bussy scedules and cant add this to their scedules so they get stressed and dont know what to do, do to the fact of not being able to find time for it, and the other 35% has time for it so they can add it to their scedules. However this is true but let me tell you why this isnt the case for all students. According to a studies done on time managment, states that 80% of students could manage their time so they could do these activity and the other 20% said the reason they couldn't was do to not properly setting up a good scedule. Basically this means that 80% had the time for it and the other 20% of students couldn't because they didn't set a scedule up properly or just didnt set one up.

To sum it up, there should be activitys it help the student you the reader better learn and buil skill maybe even find a hobby that you like. I think the people that go against this shouldn't but that my opinion, and the reason I think they shouldn't is because it helps benefit learning it help the student refresh so they don't fall alsleep in class o start day dreaming because if they stop listening how are they going to learn. you the reader could do something about this you talk to other students or teachers and get their take on it.

A4C45995B765,"In my own opinion I think driverless cars is a good and more effective idea than how we drive today. Driverless cars will make roads more safe for the driver, pedestrians, and other drivers on the road. Driverless cars is re-inventing how we've been driving for decades. The cars will use less gass and be more economy safe and they meet more people's needs unlike any bus or taxi ever could.

Study shows that a driverless car is less hazardous than any human driving. With a driverless car you don't have to worry about human mistakes, such as, someone picking up the phone and takings their eyes off the road; or someone putting on making up, brushing/combing their hair, or even eating while only keeping one hand attended to the wheel. A driverless car will alert the driver when there is danger ahead and will even come to a complete stop if necessary. Driverless cars won't run red lights, go over the speed limit, or even get out of control as a drunk driver would. Driverless cars is one of the many invention leading into the new world.

Cars that you won't have to drive is a good idea. I think they should be allowed in more states as long as they've been tested and proven to be safe. Driverless cars are hazardous free and economically beneficial, they would fundamentally change the world.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
607520b5,"In the United States we have been voting for president for many decades. But now there are protest against the process of electing a president. Many argue that the electoral college should be abolished and others feel that we should elect by popular vote. I strongly believe that we should change to popular vote because the electors could defy peoples will, they are unfair to voters, and people arent necessarily voting for their president.

To begin with, the electors have the power to defy peoples will. State legislators are responsible for picking electors and those electors can defy the will of people. ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their partys candidate and cast a deciding for whomever they please."" said Bradford Plumer.This is not right because the legislatures are picking electors that are using their powers for the worst.

Next,the electoral college is unfair to the voters. "" Because of the winnertakesall system in each state,candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" said Plumer. For example , during the 2000 campaign only 17 states didnt see the candidates all, that includes Rhode Island and South Carolina. Electoral colleges are not being fair to the states and their voters.

Lastly, the election process should be changed to popular vote because voters are necessarily voting for the president. Most people think that when they go to vote for their president that their votes are what decides the final outcome, but thats not true!.Its the electoral college that decides that. Some people dont vote for that reason , because they dont think that their vote will change anything. And in the end it does not seem very fair that are votes count by very little.

In conclusion, the way we elect are president every four years should be changed. It should go based on popular vote not on electoral college because elector could defy people, they are unfair to voters , and people arent necessarily voting for their president. For all the reason people should be able to vote and they will know that their vote will be counted.",0,train_essays,,5
633086DD8FB9,"The author supports his idea in studying Venus in many ways. Exploring Venus can lead up to many ways to improvise. If we study Venus we can learn more about the planet, such as, if it was once an earth like planet . It could also help us even save the Earth in the long run. My final reason why we should explore Venus is because it can lead us in exploring other planets.

First of all exploring Venus has a tough task, but we can learn a lot about the planet if we do explore it. We could even find out if it was once an earth like planet. We could discover new oils or new rocks. If we do discover new oil we could even put a mining system on Venus and have more oils. Exploring Venus can even help us find new minerals as well. We could discover many new things if we explore Venus ,dispite it having challenges.

Second of all Venus could have been an earth like planet."" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system"" If this was true we could make more and more explorations and maybe even find out why it heated up so much and if we find everything out it could help us maybe even save earth one day when the sun expands more. It can help us save our planet .

Third of all If we decide to explore Venus we would have to improvise all of our machinery to sustain that heat on Venus. The heat on Venus averages to 800 degrees fahrenheit and also the atmospheric perssure is 90 times greater than what we expierence here on our own planet. We would have to make our machines and robots heat resistant. These innovations could even help us explore other planets. It would make the innovations easier if we want to explore colder planets in the future. This can spark an exploration of many other plantes. It could even help us reach other galexies and explore there. Exploring Venus can help us invent and Innovate many of our technology and it can end up helping us explore the whole solar system.

In conclusion exploring Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers would help us out a lot. As i explaned in the paragraphs above, it can help us improve and succeed. We would earn so much more about the planet, such as if it were actually a earth like planet . We could also discover many new things such as oils and minerals. Last of all it could help us in exploring other planets. It can help our innovations get easier so we could explore colder planets too. This is why exploring Venus would help us , even though it has lots of risks it could still help us out in the future.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
CE19B516A167,"effects of adding an additional 1.5 hours to the school day on student learning and grades.

It is widely accepted that students need more time to learn and succeed academically. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards adding extra time to the school day, with some schools even extending the day by up to 1.5 hours. The purpose of this essay is to explore the evidence supporting the idea that providing extra time for learning helps students succeed academically, and to examine a personal anecdote illustrating how student performance is affected when there is not enough time to complete their classwork.

One of the most significant pieces of evidence supporting the idea that providing extra time for learning helps students succeed academically is a study conducted by the RAND Corporation in 2011. The study found that adding an additional 90 minutes to the school day led to a significant improvement in student achievement, particularly for low-income students. The study also found that the benefits of the additional time were most pronounced in subjects such as math and science, where students were able to spend more time practicing and applying new concepts.

Another piece of evidence supporting the idea that providing extra time for learning helps students succeed academically is the success of educational systems around the world that incorporate longer school days. For example, in Finland, students attend school for only 6 hours a day, but they consistently rank among the top performers in international tests. This success is attributed to the fact that Finnish students have access to a wide range of extracurricular activities and opportunities for hands-on learning, which helps to develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

A personal anecdote illustrating how student performance is affected when there is not enough time to complete their classwork is my own experience with a particularly challenging math class. In this class, the teacher would often assign complex problems that required students to spend several hours working on them outside of class. However, many students, including myself, did not have the time or resources to complete these assignments to the best of their ability. As a result, I often found myself struggling to keep up with the course material and my grades began to suffer.

In conclusion, the evidence supporting the idea that providing extra time for learning helps students succeed academically is compelling. By adding an additional 1.5 hours to the school day, students would have more time",1,llammistral7binstruct,,5
a2586b3a,"Dear State Senator of Florida, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College has been a huge part of America since our founding fathers, who established this process. This process helps keep America in order in and in line. Where would our country be without it? We would be lost and confused with no direction to follow. The Electoral College helps keep America's voting process organized, which is key to a well functioning country. Which is why I believe that we should absolutely keep the Electoral College so that our voting process stays organized and because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning.

I believe we should keep the Electoral College because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning. Our founding fathers were the ones the establish the Electoral College which means it has been around since the beginning of our country. We should not change this tradition of America because it has seemed to kept us running smoothly for this long so why would we want to change that for no reason? If we stopped this tradition and changed it to all popular vote from citizens we would be hurting America in a huge way. It would completely change our ways of thinking, living, and running of America. Yes, a lot has changed in America since our founding fathers and yes change is sometimes for the better in our country because things are obviously different now then what they were 200 years ago but change would not be for the better in this situation. Let's say your grandmother, Mr. Senator, has had a peach cobbler recipe in your family for ages and it just takes your breath away with all the flavor and its divine taste, but this recipe is very old. If your grandmother's old recipe taste so delicious you would not want to change one thing about that recipe. Well same with the Electoral College. Its extremely old but it has also kept our country running well and has not failed us yet so we should not change this process just like you would not want to change your grandmothers peach cobbler recipe. This is why I think we should keep the Electoral College because it has kept us going since the beginning and you do not change something just because it is old or thought of being outdated.

Voting for someone to be the head and leader of an organization is an extremely big deal, especially when that organization is a country with laws, citizens, and many other important topics. America needs to have a president willing to stand up for what is right, be there for his people, and run America in a smooth and organized fashion. If the elections were based upon popular vote then imagine what could happen, someone running for president could act like a person who is willing to take on the huge responsibility and stand up for what is right, but when everyone votes for him and they get into office then they turn into a total coward and someone not determined enough to take on the responsibility or take on America. With Electoral College those running for president are also being voted on by Congress and qualified citizens. This makes things run much more smoothly because citizens are still getting to put there two cents in but only if they are qualified which is much more reasonable. Citizens are a huge part of America, they have a lot to do with America running smoothly or not, which is why they should have a say in who runs their country, but no so much of a say that its unorganized and completely on their own opinion. I mean lets face it, us citizens have our flaws and dont always make the best decisions or have the best opinions. Having qualified citizens voting and Congress members voting make it much more understandable. Most Congress members will have been in Office for a very long time which makes them wiser and better to understand the whole voting process, the way America runs, and laws. Most will be able to pick out the better qualities for president out of each of the members running for president. This is why I belive we should keep the Electoral College because it keeps voting organized.

The Electoral College is what keeps our voting process in order. When something gets old you do not throw it away if it still is of good use for you and the Electoral College is definetly still in good shape and is doing our country well so we should not change it because it has kept our country functioning from the beginning and so our voting process stays organized.",0,train_essays,,6

I think that you shouldn't make it a mandatory thing. If kids wanted to volunteer they would. I think everyone should do something to help the community, but making someone do something they really don't care about will just make them mad and or dislike you. I know not everyone will like what you do and roles would be roles. But still. Maybe if we had a bunch of fun volunteering projects kids could do through school it would make it easier for them to see volunteering doesn't have to be just like picking up trash (which is a good thing but honestly no fun) you could go to a pet shelter and play with the animals. Or I always that it would be fun to train service dogs for the blind or something like that. Or go to a soup kitchen and feed the homeless, that's what I do. I don't know, I don't think the principal would change his mind about roles for the school by one latter from a student but it's just my opinion on community projects. Thanks for reading my letter!

F5E3CF7E54B6,"CELL PHONE USAGE POLICY PAPER

I believe policy number one is better. But there are some flaws with it though. It would be better to allow students to have some cell phone usage in a day. Why would you take phones out of schools anyway?

If you completely eliminate cell phone usage then the trouble will definitely shoot into the sky. Students will want to have their cell phones and since they have been banned, then students will start to sneak them. Students have to have there cell phones and will start to get very angry at the schools and stop cooperating well.

If you limit cell phone usage the trouble will go down. some students may still get in trouble, but definitely not as many. The question is: Why use our phones in class if we can use them at lunch and other free time? Why get in trouble for using it now when i can use it later for free?

If you leave the policy the same then students will get worse and worse about sneaking phones. Then teachers will get worse and worse and worse about catching cell phone users. Nothing but the trouble rate will go up.

Using policy number two or leaving it the same will make the trouble rate worse because of sneaking cell phones. Policy number one on the other hand, will cause trouble rates to go down because students will get some usage of cell phones everyday. Why go through more trouble to make the trouble even worse? You should definitely choose policy one so that you have a happy staff and happy students.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
144E2BFD59A3,"Have you ever been in a situation where you dont have any idea what to do and you ask one of your friends for help? or did not tell anyone and it backfired? Asking a friend or a trusted adult for help is a good way to get advice, but what if their was a was to make it a amazing way to get advice, would you take it? People now and days dont take into consideration that they have so many people to talk to and share their opinions with. Seeking multiple opinions is a extraordinary was to get advice. Because some people know more about the topic than others, one persons point of view might be biased, and others could possibly have more wisdom than you.

First, some people know more about the topic than others. The more people you ask the more precise¬†your answer will be. If you only ask one person for their opinion it is the only stand you will hear, but if you ask 3 or more people for their opinion you get to hear multiple people share their views about the topic. As well as that, If you ask people to give you their opinions and the people on one side of¬†the argument gets three votes and the other side gets zero you should most likely go with the first choice. Most people agree with that topic, there is a Spanish proverb that states ""If three people call you a donkey you are probably a donkey,but you can change the way you act or in this case change the people you ask and you will not¬†look like a donkey anymore, you might still be a donkey on the inside but on the outside you are not.""Furthermore, Other peoples experience might be better than yours, so if someone was in your situation before they will know what to do and help you. Because they know firsthand what it is to be in that situation. Some people might say that it will be hard to find someone who is in the same shoes as you. To that I would say their are more people than you think who have gone through what you have, but they may have not told many people yet. So when you have a situation, seeking others opinions is a great way to get multiple peoples advice.

Second, When seeking advice it is crucial that you make sure their or your points of view on the situation are not biased. As a example, If someone has a biased point of view on a topic they will only tell you what they think is right and not tell you the other side of the story,and you dont ask anyone else about your situation you only have that one biased piece of information. This could cause you to make the wrong decision, but if you ask multiple¬†people for their advice you will get a clue as to who is actually right in the situation. Expanding on that,When asking for opinions on a topic make sure that you ask someone you trust or you know will give you the right answers¬†for you personally. Some examples of people you could ask are your friends,family,doctor,coach,teacher,and many more. If you ask these people, you know that they will give you the best advise, Because they only want the best from you. In addition, If you have a biased point of view on a topic you need to let that go. Because, it will cloud your head and you will not be able to take in the advice people are giving you. This happens because if you think that your view is the best or superior to another and someone contradicts that, you will not take in the facts they are telling you. If you want to get multiple opinions from people make sure your mindset is not biased. So when finding opinions its essential to make sure that you dont go out and get biased information.

Third,When finding multiple opinions for advice it is very important that you ask someone with a lot of wisdom for advice on your topic. Adding on to that, someone who is older or who has been here longer might know more than a younger person with not as much experience dealing with the real world. A senior citizen might have some experience dealing¬†with many situations that you are going thought. Because they already went thought the hardships of life and could help you out tremendously, but some people might not know the answer fully. They will give you all of the information they know, but you have to ask more people for advice in order to get your full answer. Consequently, Someone wiser will give you a more truthful and in depth answer, they know that there are both sides to every problem and will tell you the right one. Wise people are people who are not selfish, they just want to make life easier for you because they most likely experienced what you are experiencing now. Furthermore,Somebody who is smart might not be the best person to ask, sure they are smart but they have not gone thought the things wise and elderly people have experienced. You can be smart but you cant know everything. Sometimes you have to go and ask for advice. Many people ask one person who is wise or smart for advice, but you need to know that the more people you ask for advice the better. Because some people only have half the story to get the full advice and make the best decision possible you, you half to get multiple sources. I hear people say that you know whats best for your body and that might be true, but sometimes you have to accept the fact that other people have more wisdom or knowledge than your and they would know what the best course of action is. Also people who have already been in this situation know about it, and you need to ask them for advice, not just wing it and go with what your gut tells you.

Finally,To the question I had in the beginning""Have you ever been in a situation where you you dont have any idea what to do and you ask one of your friends for help?"" I would say yes but after I figured out that you need to get multiple peoples advice I would always ask 3 or more people to give me their opinion. Because people are better in one skill of life not in another, a Persons views are sometimes biased, and People have more wisdom than others. After this you need to learn to ask multiple people for advice in order to make better choices.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

C1EAD0C50570,"Participating in extracurricular activities at school can bring a lot of benefits to students. From physical and mental health to social interaction and improved academic performance, there are countless advantages to taking part in one of the many activities available. 

Physical health can be improved through extracurricular activities, as the focus on regular exercise can help reduce stress levels and build strength. With mental health, activities like debate clubs, team sports, and drama can help students work through emotions they experience and learn vital life skills.

Social interaction is an important part of everyday life and school is no exception. Extracurricular activities can help students build meaningful relationships that may last far beyond high school. Team sports teach the importance of working together, theater trains individuals to work through their fears in a safe environment, and clubs give students the chance to share their interests. 

Finally, extracurricular activities are a great way to improve academic performance. Whether students are rehearsing lines for a play or supporting their team in a basketball game, the daily commitment of practicing skills or discussing relevant issues can help concentrate and sharpen their minds. In addition, leadership development from extracurricular activities can give students an edge when it comes to college applications.

In conclusion, the benefits of extracurricular activities are essential for students in many aspects of life.

1C7FDCD3337C,"Dear Senator,

What do you think about descarding electorial voting?,do you feel that it would be best to keep it this way,or do you think there should be a change? What you think i dont know. But

In my opinion i recomend that the electorial voting should not be changed.

One of my main reasons for this is electorial voting has mostlikely been going on for decades,and why would you deside to change this now? This act could possibly throw some important things off track. For example if you were to go fourth with this act you could possibly risk people selecting the wrong president and his electors,which then could risk people to lose there jobs,homes,end up homeless,etc this could be avoided if you keep things how they are and not end up messing things up changing electoral voting.

Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,and Bob Dole feel differently with my reason,they all feel that you should abolishe the electoral voting,they thaat sence Al Gore lost the presedency but won the popular vote they think that people are being cheated out of there vote and its not fair. I disagree with them because the senators have a say in who is going to win the election and be president all at the end,so why worry.

In conclusion people should not worry about what happens with the House Of Represintative,or the election,i'd tell folks to leave that up to the senator to decide because there people like us,and im sure they wouldent want someone causing trouble in presedency.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
A2E1F55E3696,"Do you ever wish that you could have the chance to do a fun activity during or after school? Some schools are making students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe students should have to do an extracurricular activity because it can start new friendships, and in could be fun.

Doing extracurricular activities can start new friendships. If you find someone with the same interest as you, then you two may become friends. It can be hard for people to meet new friends, but if you find someone with a similar interest then it could be easier to become friends with them. Secondly you guys could do activities together. If you two were to both to play an instrument, then you could practice together. Doing an extracurricular activity could give you topics to talk about with friends. If your at lunch one day and you run out of things to talk about, your extracurricular activity could be a good topic. If you miss out on an opportunity for an extracurricular activity, then you could be missing out on an amazing friendship

Participating in extracurricular activities could be fun. first off there are field trips. Why wouldn't you want to skip a day of school and hang out with friends on a fun field trip? Also you get to do something you enjoy. It can give you a little extra time doing what you love. Lastly it can open up new opportunities. Things like band and orchestra may have festivals or auditions that you could do. Extracurricular activities can give you lots of chances to have fun, and enjoy school a little more.

However, some people may say that students will lose interest. They say picking the wrong topic could lead to a year of being board. This could make students dislike the class or not want to go to it. Although, most students say that they enjoy their extracurricular activity, and even if its not their favorite class, they don't dread going to it. For example if a student liked science class more than yearbook, that doesn't mean that the student doesn't want to go to school. But if a student really didn't like the class, then they would know in the future not to pick it again. It would at the least give a student direction on if they would want to do that activity again. Even though people say that kids will lose interest in the activity they choose, students will always be able to get something out of it.

Having to do an extracurricular activity could lead to new friendships and a year of fun. Being able to experience a extracurricular activity can be a great way to open yourself up to new things, and try different activities. You'll never know what you missed out on if you don't take an extracurricular activity.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,5
C9574F58662A,"TEXTING AND DRIVING

In the state of Georgia, anyone behind the wheel of a motor vehicle cannot hold or even touch a cellphone. The driver can be sitting still at a red light or even stopped in traffic, the driver cannot touch a cellphone. The first time a Georgia driver is caught on a cellphone, they could receive a fine of fifty dollars, and one point assigned against the driver's license. A driver may have headsets and earpieces for communication purposes only. Not for listening to music or other entertainment. In Georgia, it is already against the law to wear both headphones in while driving, although a driver may have one earpiece in, both are not allowed.

National Highway Transportation Safety Administration concluded that texting and driving is six times more dangerous than driving while intoxicated. Each day, roughly nine people are killed in crashes caused by distracted driving.

About 3,285 deaths a year are caused by distracted driving. Texting while driving distracts the driver by taking the eyes off the road, making drunk driving less dangerous because you have your eyes on the road at more times than looking at the phone. Over 94 percent of Georgia drivers support the hands free law. In 2017 there 39,773 gun related deaths in the U.S, in comparison an estimated 391,000 drivers were injured by distracted driving in 2017.

In 2013, ten percent of all drivers' ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. Texting and driving is more common with teens than adults. Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field. Texting and driving isn't just dangerous for you and everyone on the road but it's banned in most states. All it takes is that ""just once ""time for you to hurt yourself or someone else. Most people think they can pay attention to the road and do something else at the same time. In every article you'll see there's no comparing texting while driving to anything else. In most states the penalty can be jail time for multiple offenders, you wouldn't drive while blindfolded so for the safety for you, or whoever you may be with don't text and drive.

046A86DE2898,"Have your parents ever forced you to do a sport? You usually end up not having fun. If you're doing activities against your will, why would you want to bring that to school? Extra curricular activities shouldn't¬†be enforced because it interferes with the parents' schedule, it takes away the students' factor of choice, and it prevents teachers from going home at their typical time.

To start off, enforcing after school activities isn't a great idea because it can interfere with parents' schedules. For example, parents might not be able to pick up their kids late, possibly due to the fact that they need someone to help out with their younger children. If kids are held after school, the parents will need to rearrange their schedule in order to be there for their kids. In addition, this policy could prevent the parents from being able to pick their kids up. depending on how late the extracurricular activities run, parents could be busy with other things, such as grocery shopping, by the time their kid gets out of school. Also, some parents depend on public transportation. If there isn't a conveniently scheduled bus, the child won't have a way to get home. These scenarios demonstrate how enforcing clubs, sports, or groups can intervene with parents' schedules.

Secondly, having extracurricular activities after school as a priority isn't a good idea because it takes away the student's factor of choice. Adding on, children won't be as independent as they would have been, which will effect them later in life. If they don't build their individuality now, then they could possibly have trouble with it in years to come. In addition, students could feel controlled. If these policies are made, kids could feel like they don't have a say in what goes on in their space of education. Also, children will have to schedule their outside life around after school. They might be put in a position where they have to let go of activities they're passionate in, simply to not get in trouble at school. These three examples show why extracurricular policies will take away a child's choice.

Lastly, making extracurricular¬†activities a necessity isn't an great decision because it forces teachers to stay later. To start, teachers have a life after school, and staying later than normal could interfere on that. Also, educators might have to complete chores, such as buying groceries, before a certain time each day. Having them stay late could throw off their whole routine. Lastly, many teachers have kids of their own. Depending on their age(s), they will get dismissed from school at different times. This is why necasary extracurricular activities will affect a teacher's schedule.

As shown in these paragraphs, enforcing extracurricular activities can affect the parents' everyday plan, prevent kids from making their own choices, and interfere with teachers' after school life. Holding back students affects more than just the kids. It affects everyone involved, and more. With these explanations, hopefully you won't be forced to play a sport or join a group again.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
E9E68651B168,"Hey, I'm like totally against the idea of extending school hours. I mean, I know some people might think it's a good idea to get more learning in, but I think it would be super lame.

First of all, let's talk about how it would be harder for students to pay attention. Like, I already have trouble focusing in class sometimes, and if we had to be there even longer, I don't know how I would make it through. My brain would start to like, mush, or something. And who wants to be in a classroom for even longer when you're already feeling drained? Not me, that's for sure.

And don't even get me started on how students would disrespect their teachers even more. I mean, I know some kids can be pretty rambunctious, but if we had to be in school longer, they would probably get even more rowdy. And I don't think teachers would be able to handle it. They already have a lot of work to do, and adding more hours to their day would be like, super unfair.

But you know what's even worse? The uprising among students. Like, if we had to be in school longer, there would probably be a ton of complaining and stuff. And honestly, I don't think it would be worth it. I mean, I'd rather have more free time to do things I actually enjoy, like playing video games or hanging out with my friends.

So, here's what I think we should do instead. Instead of making school hours longer, let's make the additional hours optional after-school activities. That way, students can choose to go to things like sports, clubs, or even just hang out in the library and read. It would be way more fun and engaging than just sitting in a classroom all day.

Plus, think about how much more flexible it would be for students. Like, if they want to learn more about a certain subject, they could go to a club or activity that focuses on that. Or, if they just want to relax and do nothing, they could hang out in the library. It would be like, totally up to them.

So, there you have it. That's my argument against extending school hours.",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

ac0526d7,"Dear, State Senator I have recently read articles about the electoral vote system currently in place in the united states.

The electoral vote system elects other people, called electors, to vote for the people. They basically vote for president, if you and many others vote for himher. I believe the electoral vote system is glitchy, outdated, and confusing to some.

The electoral vote system can be manipulated and unfair. The electors can be choosen by state conventions, state central committees, and the candidates running for president. If the president can choose his electors, could'nt he replace the original electors for new ones that will guarantee a vote for him. The peoples vote would'nt matter. This situation happened in the twothousand election when George W. Bush won the election with more individual votes than electoral votes. This violates our constitution which states, the government is controlled by the people and allows for change if enough people in the US want it. If you've ever noticed that during the presidential election, candidates don't come to certain states. In the electoral system, each state has a winnertakeall system. When the state goes over their electoral votes, the winner with the most electoral votes takes all of them, while the electoral votes of the opponent gets no votes toward him. This can cause mayhem, the noncounted votes can make a big difference in the election. In nineteenseventy six their would have been a tie if 9,246 voters in Hawaii and Ohio voted the opposing side. The elections come close and without the popular vote which accounts for millions of people in America, we may have had better elections with less debates. The electoral college contains 538 electors, out of those 538 their only 270 are mandatory to vote. Each elector equals each member in your states House Of representatives and add two for the senate. California has a population of 35 million and wyoming has a population of 500,000. Wyoming having 5 electors and california having 55. This doese'nt make sense because if a state may have a higher population than wyoming but yet still have less electors. The system is very confusing in these ways causing some to vote for the wrong candidate and others thinking they are voting for the right candidate they believe is true.

The electoral votes are'nt the worst because we are still showing our democracy, showing off Americas greatnest in its government. The electoral vote crisis in twothousand rarely happens. This situation has'nt happened since eighteeneighty eight, its a rare occurance. Electoral votes also make the playing field even. If we had popular votes in place, then wouldnt the presidents have a landslide if they went to all the biggest populated states. The electoral votes can allow ties and close elections to happen instead of land slides in many elections.

The electoral votes should be replaced. Even so they even out the playing field and the occurrence of rigged electoral votes happen, it still doese'nt make up for the both elections lost in eighteeneighty eight and two thousand. If we dont change the electoral votes soon, the occurance of electoral vote sabotage will occur more often causing an unfair government to be in place.",0,train_essays,,2

Making Mona Lisa Smile is written by Nick D'Alto,and it points out the fact how computers can tell how emotions by calculation. A technology known as the facial action coding system enables computers to indentify human emotions. Some of the advantages of the computers is that it can observe, calculate and identify the human muscles.

One way the computers can identify how emotions is by observing the 44 major muscles bone in human. Creating a 3-D model of the face the computers has been able to observe this muscles and where they are located in the body and their movement, in paragraph one the text states that ""

the process begins when the computers constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. without observation of this mucles movement in the body the computer wouldn't be able to indentify the muscles that actually produce this emotions. Therefore they also need to calculate like humans.

in anothert different way the computers have been able to calculate this bones that makes this emotions in the body through the producers. The producers observes the way human tell emotions by calculation, on paragraph five the text states that "" in fact we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply looking on her face. Calculation is one important thing the computers need to do for better result without them calculating like humans they would probably give us wrong result, and they can do this by observation of the bones shape. whereby can tell emotions.

Way other way computers would provide specific answer like angry, happy... is by knowing the parts of the body to identify the positions of the bone. Emotions as we know can be told by looking at the face at an individual face, on paragraph 7 it says ""while looking at the mirror: raise your lips at the cornersof your mouth, then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling (""cow's-feet) at the corner of your eyes, holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up. toward your eyes"" basically the computer has to identify parts of your body to detects the bones which can produce excellent result.

llama_70b_v1327,"Zoos have been a place of wonder and fascination for many people, especially children, for a long time. They provide an opportunity to see animals up close and learn about their behavior, habitat, and conservation status. However, the role of zoos in conservation and education has been a topic of debate. Some argue that zoos are necessary for the protection and preservation of endangered species, while others believe that they are unethical and serve no educational purpose. In my opinion, zoos are important for conservation and education, but they need to be improved and managed properly.

Firstly, zoos play a vital role in the conservation of endangered species. They help to protect animals from habitat loss, poaching, and other human activities that threaten their survival. For example, zoos participate in breeding programs for endangered species, such as the giant panda, the snow leopard, and the black-footed ferret. These programs help to increase the population of these species and reduce the risk of extinction. Additionally, zoos provide a safe place for animals to live and thrive, especially for those that are injured or orphaned in the wild.

Secondly, zoos serve as an important tool for education. They provide an opportunity for people, especially children, to learn about different species, their habitats, and their behavior. Zoos offer educational programs, guided tours, and interactive exhibits that help to educate visitors about the importance of conservation and the need to protect wildlife. For example, the Bronx Zoo in New York City has a program called "" Congo Gorilla Forest"" which teaches visitors about the gorillas' habitat, behavior, and conservation status.

However, it is important to note that not all zoos are created equal. Some zoos still engage in unethical practices such as keeping animals in small enclosures, using them for entertainment purposes, and not providing adequate care. These practices need to stop, and zoos need to be improved and managed properly. For example, zoos should provide large, naturalistic enclosures that mimic the animals' wild habitat, and they should employ qualified staff to ensure the animals' well-being.

In conclusion, zoos play a vital role in conservation and education, but they need to be improved and managed properly. They provide a safe place for endangered species to live and thrive, and they offer an opportunity for people to learn about different species and the importance of conservation. By supporting zoos that are committed to animal welfare and conservation, we can help to ensure the protection and preservation of our planet's biodiversity.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The role of zoos in conservation and education has been a topic of debate.

F680F4460788,"Dear state senator,

My letter is in regards to changing the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. I believe that we, the people, should have the opportunity to choose whom we wish to become President.

The reason why people go out to vote, is because they have a specific person in mind. Although throughout election time, many people are brought to different conclusions that one candidate is better then the other, or they both have their flaws yet, they strongly represent one thing the other candidate dispises. Either way, there are those types of people who just cannot decide. They may be left undecided, and have changed their minds by the time it's ready to vote. It's a big deal for people to go out and take action. So what would make the electoral college change one view of voting? Its the fact that we aren't really voting for our president. We are voting for our electors of the state, to vote for our president. And on top of that, there are still many people out there who don't have a clue that their actually voting for someone in our state to decide for us. Although the electoral college does help make the presidential election less complicated, it's the mere fact that WE aren't making much of a difference.

The electoral college doesn't only have a few minor set backs, but it could tarnish out dreams of who we wanted to be president by way more than we could've expected. When it comes to voting for electors, its a difficult thing when it comes to how many electors represent which political party. Democrat, or Republican. Say one wanted the one candidate running for president to win, and he/she were Republican. That person would go out and cast a vote for a slate of however many of republican electors there are for that state. The part that gets a lot of people is that there could be fewer Republican electors then there are Democrat electors. Say one still wanted the Republican candidate to win and they voted in their residential state which was Nevada. IF Nevada had 4 Republican electors then that meant anyone who voted for the Democrat electoral wasn't chipping in much to the election. In the end, all the electors votes are counted for each side, and because Nevada had only two dedicated Democrats, the chances of the Democrat candidate having less electoral votes then the Republican candidate, has increased. If this problem happenes for several other states, then the chances double, even triple.

If this doesn't make you think that the electoral college should go, then think again. The electoral college is definitely unfair to voters. Any chance of unfaithful electors, could happen. It could make one feel betrayed that they voted foe a specific elector to do one job. Which was to help select the president the voter wanted. Whats the point in putting your trust in someone who could just easily turn around and NOT vote who you wanted? There is no point. But that's what we're doing when we vote. We are making it an option for that to happen. So why not vote by popular vote? Why not avoid all the issues the electoral college can cause for us? We should be lucky that back in '00, that was the biggest election crisis and it COULD'VE been worse.

In conclusion, we the people, should have the opportunity to vote and actually have our vote counted. Because every state doesnt't have the sam eamount of people in each, the chances of there being a tie in the presidential election, is slightly unlikely. Other then there being a tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the votes add up tp 538; an even number. We shouldn;t put ourselves through this, and truth be told, the election is confusing as it is. I say, we should get rid of the electoral college. It's not needed, and a pain.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†       ¬†¬†¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

For example, there was a time when I was told by a teacher to try a new method in reading that I come up with because she said thats something to make you remember what youve just learned ,and ever since then I have always been open to new things and ideas when it comes to coming up with a new way of learning. Therefore, I always try to incourage others to do the same because its something that strenghtings you, opens the mind, and makes you a smarter individual.

Using your mind in diffrent ways stimulates students brains and Creates new pathways for information to be shared. This is a way to get a better understanding of ways you can look at certain situations as a student. For instance, you might not like the way things are going in class but if you were to sit and think of better ways to handle the problem it will show you that thinking in diffrent ways can make a problem a blessing you just have to be willing to put forth the effort. trying is better than not trying and that can make a big diffrence in your life and how you live it. It takes being diverse on how you think to become a great student.

Students creating their own project for their summer break is one of the best things you can get a student to do because they have to think and use diffrent ideas to complete a assignment that they choose. Its important to understand the importance of this because it will give them something to do to remember what they learned from school in the past year while they are on summer break, so they can't forget any information that is needed for years to come. Also will be alot easier for them to accomplish things in the future due to working in the summer nights through school and this will highly benefit the students and their future. Thats the reason I think this will be beneficial to anyone who attempts.

Another reason is that it will prepare the students for a heavy work load in years to come. For example, being in highschool and later going on to college is not just a walk in the park its hard days and long nights to accomplish something bigger. Students doing this at a young age will have them ready for the highschool and college lifestyle. Also will give them something they can never loose and thats the dicipline you get from doing obstacles like this because it keeps you from getting distracted and helps you focus harder on the project and they all starts with you aswell so its the dicipline you aquire from doing things like that.

In conclusion, students are required to design their own project they are to complete over the course of summer and create it by themselves. I agree with this because it can give the students important qualities that they only can get from doing something like a self made project and can benefit them for their future. Doing certain things in life are only to help you learn and grow and doing a project like this will help you be able to multitask and do things a different way then you see everyone else doing. Therefore students designing their own projects can help and benefit them to be a better individuals in the future.   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3
D5202DF530D1,"I feel like people making their own decisions will be a lot better for that person. But seeking guidance is that bad either for someone to make their own decisions says to someone else that they know what they are doing and can build something great with how their working and planning for the future.

Although seeking guidance is the worst thing to do, i feel like people making decisions for themselves is better.

For example if i were to go to someone for guidance or for something more and they give me some sort of guidance or idea and it turn out bad for me. Than i would never be able to go another person for guidance and ideas and i would most likely turn to myself. Then theres the problem that the reason that i went to seek guidance was because i couldn't make a decision for myself and now since I'm self reliant it will be hard for me to make my own decisions.

Now if i didn't go to the authorities and experts and made the decision for myself but it still ended up being bad outcome. It still would have been a lot better for me so that i can use the experience of making my own decision to help make better one in the future.

Now if you go to the authorities and experts to seek guidance and it it come out great and now your life is going great. Until the time to make your own decision it will be even harder to make then the time you went for guidance. That you yourself will fell behind and lose whatever chance that you had because you never made a decisions for yourself and thats problem some people have because they have been going to someone else to make your life decisions.

In conclusion to go somewhere to seek guidance isn't bad it's what comes out of it to help you if it turns out bad or good it will effect your decision making to be better and worst. In my opinion making your own decision will be better then any expert ideas because it help yo in your life and what comes after every decision you make for better or worst.",0,original_moth,"Task:

B34118DCC728,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke joins the Seagoing Cowboy program.

In this story it talks about what Luke does on his journey so, this is what were are going to talk about.

In paragraph 1 it says Luke's friend Don Reist invited Luke to go with him to the Seagoing Cowboy program and Luke did not turn the offer down because that was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In paragraph 4 it said that

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which ment he could be drafted for military service.

""When my drafy board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.""

By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

In paragraph 5 there were some reasons he should join the Seagoing Cowboys, and it said ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says.

""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,""

he says. ""So was taking a Gondala ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

In paragraph 7 the way Luke's claim supported the outcome of the story.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea.

On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.

One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside.

Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive.

But he could not work for a couple days because of cracked ribs.

My conclusion of the story is in paragraph 9 when it says, But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

It opened up the world to him.

""I am grateful for the opportunity,"" he says.

""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
319B2511943D,"Have you ever thought your choice wasn't the best? Not feeling like your did the right thing can cause a lot of anxiety. So, a way to release yourself from that endless regret is asking for other people's opinions. Asking other people for their opinion can help you make a better decision because others can point out certain things you missed and it causes you less anxiety.

To begin, people think differently, so they can point out things you may have missed. They can prove a point that you didn't even know existed in the situation. For example, if I was stuck trying to figure out if I should get the gray or white sweatpants for when I go horseback riding. So, I ask a friend which color I should get, and they point out that the white sweatpants would probably get dirty and disgusting, so I should just get the gray ones instead. Right there is a prime example of something I didn't even think about and in the end they ended up helping me make the right decision.

Lastly, it causes less anxiety for you to feel like you made absolute best decision. Feeling like you've made the wrong decision can cause a lot of stress and anxiety for a person. Almost enough to swallow you whole! That's why asking for another opinion is beneficial for you and your anxiety. Having a second opinion really does help!

In conclusion, seeking other people's opinions help big time in the long run. Asking for others opinions release a lot of weight off your shoulders. Multiple opinions help someone make a better choice because it causes less anxiety and other people can point out somethings you didn't notice. So next time your in a slump make sure to ask for another opinion.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
76652F60F5D1,"Dear Principle,

I do not think that all students should be required to perform community service. I do not agree with this requirement because not all kids have time in their regular day to perform community services. Some students have after school sports that take up much of their time. Other students already have things at home they need to take care of. Some could have to watch younger brothers and sisters while their parents work, or watch pets while the parents work. Some students even are already starting jobs young to raise a little extra money to help out their family. I know that many students already have families, if not their own, with children that they babysit for money while the family's parents work. Community service would be a great thing to do for the students that have time for it out of their daily schedule, but for others, it just could not be possible. It is always nice to perform community service to help out, but sometimes there are other commitments that children have, and they can't just drop all of their commitments for this. That would be irresponsible, and I'm sure you want all of your students to be responsible in their commitments and outside of school activities or jobs. I'm sure their parents wouldn't allow them to break other commitments as well. So in the end, I think community service would be a great thing to volunteer, but should not be placed upon us as a requirement. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Sincerely,

Student.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
95BB6960C1FC,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that all students should be required to have a certain amount of community service. This could consist of helping out teachers after school, picking up trash at local parks, and even helping out with non-profit community events. However, the key to this institution would be that the students don't get paid.

In these times, I personally think that kids have too much money. Whether it comes from an allowance, or a gift, the students get too much undeserved money. I do understand that some kids work for there money, but they need to learn what service is, and the other kind of payment that you get from it. I myself have participated in many service projects, and over the years I have found that I get a sense of accomplishment that you get with nothing else that you do. This is what I mean by the ""other"" kind of payment. When you get money, even if you have worked for it, you just are happy about the profit that you have gained, and all you think about is what you could possibly spend it on. By doing service, you feel that you have helped someone with something that they could not have done without you. This could help to increase thoughts of self-worth, and self-esteem. Then that could lead to better concentration, and better focus on school work, and the things that are most important in life.

Service could also provide a good distraction from other things. If students have something good to do, and they realize that it makes them feel good about themselves, they will most likely stay away from other things. For instance drugs, parties that may have bad activities, and other dishonorable endeavors. In fact, service can almost be like a drug itself. Although a good drug, it can give you a high of self-confidence. This can then lead to an addiction where the victim would continue wanting to do it so that they could feel that way again. In all, service can act as a good distraction from other harmful things.

Another reason that service is good is because it will teach students skills that they may need later in life. For instance, I have participated in many service projects regarding service including building shelves in a concession stand, painting, building fences, and even bridges. All of these are skills that I may use, and maybe even need later in life. There is no doubt that service can teach students life skills, and lessons.

In all I think that service is a very important part of the growth, and development of not only our local school students, but of this entire nation. Service can lead to success in many fields, and we need to experience it to become successful, honest, and independent adults.

240804F8C4B8,"Phones & Driving

Cell phones have been a big common factor among people. Now and days people depend on cell phones more than anything else. Cell phones have also advanced over the years with companies coming out with new smartphones and new technology. With the new smartphones there has been more distractions to people such as driving while texting. That's why people shouldnt operate a phone while driving.

Texting while operating an automobile has shown to be dangerous and hazardous to the person driving and the people around them. This is causing a significant amount of accidents and deaths. According to the text ""Using a cell phone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on U.S. roads.""(NHTSA ). This statement it proving that being distracted by a smartphone can be dangerous and cause large amounts of accidents and deaths. When operating a vehicle people are allowed to use devices as long as they are hands free meaning that the device you are using must be voice activated so that both hands can be on the wheel at all times , but it is still proven to be a distraction to drivers. According to a psychology lecturer at the University of Sussex in England Graham Hole ""Talking on your phone while driving even if you use hands free connection is still dangerous.""because any conversation on the phone can be a distraction to the person surroundings.

This new generation of people and all the new smartphones and gadgets are causing people to be more dependent on cell phones than anything else. Everyday people walk around with their heads in there phones not paying attention to where their going. Now that people use vehicles for everyday use its is easy for them to get side track and use their phones while driving. With the new features on the updated smartphones you can do video calls and voice automated things on your phone. With these new features on smartphones people are more prone to using their phones while driving causing a higher risk of death and accidents.

Everyday someone is involved in a car accident because they were on there phone, texting while driving is the leading cause of death. There was a 7 year old boy named Xzavier Davis - Bilbo who was crossing the street and he was hit by a car and not only was he hit but the car dragged him 20 feet . The driver was texting on the phone when she hit 7 year old Xzavier . He spent months in the ICU and he is now paralyzed because of this. When people text and drive they put everybody around them in danger not just the people in the car with them.

In conclusion phones are a very distracting factor when driving and dangerous. Anything such as a hands-free device still shouldn't be allowed because it is still a distraction. These problems are injuring and killing people. People should not text and drive.                                                              ",0,persuade_corpus,,5

We need to change it from the Electoral college to the most popular vote for the president of th Unitd States of America. Because whats the point of all of our parents and alot of other adults of voting if we can't even get what we want but no it's all up to the electors and congress, ect. like for real what is the point in voting if it isn't a fair shot.

Now that I've read it we don't even vote for the prsident we vote for the slate of electorswho in turn elect the president. Whom are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depnds on the state sometimes state conventions sometimes the stateparty's centeral committee sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for ? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate? Sometimes.

At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. And dont likethat because the what the heck is happening if were not acktually voting for the president and just the electors. Like for real then whats the point of voting if were not getting what we want. When the goverment is all about giveing the people what they want.

7380E424BD2D,"There are several advantages of limiting car usage. First and foremost, limitations will seriously reduce the emission of greenhouse gas and the production of smog caused by diesel fumes. Beautiful cities are being polluted as we speak, and that is something that could be so simply reduced. Limitations on cars will make the air cleaner.

If car usage is limited, as it has been some places, it shows to make the surrounding ares calmer. In places such as Vuban, Germany, where cars are almost completely gone, residents say they are much happier and less stressed out (Rosenthal, 2009-New York Times). Rush hours and traffic jams will be reduced, leaving more time to make cities beautiful again. Bike paths are being reconstructed in many places, in attempt to make as little imapct on the world as possible. Try a week without using a car. Use other commute options to get where you need to go. People see that they are less relient on using car commute (Rosenthal, 2013-New York Times).

Alternative transportation is encouraged. In places all over the world, people are stepping up and making a change in the way they transport themselves. Sidwalks are being remade in order to accomidate walking pedestrians (Selsky, 2002). Shopping centeres and diners are being located in closer ares, making it easier to walk or bike to them. Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company expressed his wishes for transportation by saying he wishes cities to have ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety,"" (Rosenthal, 2013).

Instead of spending so much time with car developments, limiting car usage would mean more time to other ares of development. David Goldberg of Transportation for America made and fantastic point by saying, ""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" (Rosenthal, 2009). Instead of spending so much time creating things that will ruin the world, why not use that time instead to try and better it? Construct something useful. People are doing it all over, and it's proving to work very well.

All in all, having a limitation on car use will be much easier and helpful than people realize. The more we actively work on changing the world from preventable harm, the better our surroundings will be. Even if a car is driven on occasion, it will reduce the greenhouse gas dramatically, making a positive effect on the way people live.

falcon_180b_v1_830,"I believe that arts education is essential for a well-rounded education. It provides students with the opportunity to develop their creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. The arts also help students to express themselves and build their confidence.

One reason why arts education is important is that it encourages students to think outside the box. When students are exposed to different forms of art, they are challenged to think in new and innovative ways. For example, when students are asked to create a piece of art, they must think about the colors, shapes, and textures they want to use. This encourages them to be creative and think critically about their work.

Another reason why arts education is important is that it can help students to develop important life skills. For example, when students participate in a drama class, they learn how to work in a team, communicate effectively, and manage their time. These skills are important for success in school and in the workplace.

Arts education also provides students with a way to express themselves. When students are given the opportunity to create art, they are able to express their thoughts and feelings in a way that is not possible through traditional academic subjects. This can be especially important for students who struggle with traditional subjects and need an outlet to express themselves.

In conclusion, arts education is essential for a well-rounded education. It provides students with the opportunity to develop their creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. The arts also help students to express themselves and build their confidence. Therefore, it is important that arts education is included in the curriculum of all schools.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Many people believe that arts education is essential for a well-rounded education, while others think that it should be optional.

DC011CC0196C,"Can a student taking online classes at home receive the same education as students in school? I feel that online classes can benefit students because they can work at their own pace. I also think that taking classes online will help students become more independent. However, I believe that going to school helps students become more social. Students taking online classes at home have more flexibility in there schedule than students that go to school.

Taking online classes gives students the opportunity to work at their own pace. All students work at different paces depending on their skill level in that class. Some students struggle in school because the teacher is going to fast, while other students are ahead of everybody and have to wait for people to finish. Online classes will also let students be more flexible with their schedules. Most students don't like waking up at six in the morning everyday to get ready for school and catch the bus, being able to attend class from home will let students get more sleep and in most cases have the ability to start when they want to.

Another benefit is that students will become more independent. Most students are used to being in a class where the teacher tells you everything to do. When taking an online class students will adapt to the new situation and be more self-reliable. Students will also have to get used to not having 30 classmates to help you out. At first this will be difficult for most students because a lot of the time students will rely on their classmates for assistance or answers, but it will help make them much more independent and intelligent.

Although there are many benefits towards taking online classes at home, I think that going to school will help students become more social. Going to school gives students the opportunity to meet new people and to see friends. I feel that taking classes from home will distance students from their friends. I also think that going to school will helps students experience new things. There are so many sports, clubs, and groups that are available at school that help students do things they enjoy and find new friends.

I believe taking online classes is the better option for getting a good education. I think most students will enjoy it because they get to work at their own pace and become more independent and self-reliable. Although going to school will help students stay in touch with their friends, taking online classes will help improve their education.

20D81D1BE1A6,"Yes, the use of Facial Action Codying Stystem would be very useful for students in the classroom. Not only can this technology detect when a student is confused or bored, but it can change the lesson to grab the students' attention again, or to explain it in an another way. Along with this, this technology could introduce a lot more job intrest, hobby intrest, or just pure intrest among students. Lastly, this technology would be beneficial to students because it would give us a reason to be taught about the science of emotion, we could learn and go more into depth about our basic human body and mind and how easy emotions can show.

This technology can change lessons for kids who aren't understanding, or are just completley bored of the material being shown. This can greatly change a students grades from bad to good, along with make them look forward to coming to your class or school in general. From paragraph 6 the author stated, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Ending the conversation with, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor."" Another point which dosn't relate to the fact of changing around lessons for a student would be also in paragraph 6,""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This technology can overall make a students lesson, web browsing, and understanding of materal a lot easier and it could greatly improve their work.

Secondly, the FACS can show students a different range of technology that is fairly new. It could show some kids something they may be passionate for but never knew of, it could be a possible job intrest, a new hobby interest, anything at all. The people using this technology are doing so many things, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;"" So they're not only using 3-D software but also, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements."" The people who are specializing in doing this kind of technology, are branching out in very large, and impactful ways. Many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school and they don't hear of it. They can never find it.

Lastly, having this technology in our school would give us a reason to talk about the basic science of emotion. We can learn about our human bodies and why emotion is displayed so easily, and how it's displayed as well. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" Our faces can move in multiple ways depending on the emotion we feel, as shown in paragraphs 7-8. Why does it do this? This technology can give us a valid reason to talk about the science of emotion more, and we can learn more about this as students or even as teachers.

Finally, either it be the fact that a lesson can be changed based off of if a student is bored or confused. Or that having this technology can show students a wider range of possible job choices, hobby choices, or just learning more about something out of pure intrest. Or lastly, because having this technology around us gives us a reason to talk about the science of emotion in depth. This technology could be extreamly useful, and impactful on students, if the software being used is good and has been shown to be correct. This could be a very good thing to have in schools that our students can use and to possibly even learn about. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

E2F767441B44,"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that committing to a career at a young age can have both advantages and disadvantages. While it is true that starting early can benefit future jobs, there are also reasons why people think that high school students aren't ready to commit to a career. In this essay, I will explore these arguments and discuss the confidence boost that students receive when they start early.

One advantage of committing to a career at a young age is that it can provide a clear direction for future education and job opportunities. When students know what they want to do, they can tailor their coursework and extracurricular activities to better prepare themselves for their desired career path. This can lead to more relevant and valuable education, as well as a greater likelihood of landing a job in their chosen field.

Additionally, starting early can provide students with a competitive edge in the job market. Employers often look for candidates who have relevant experience and a clear understanding of the industry they are applying for. By committing to a career at a young age and gaining experience through internships or other opportunities, students can demonstrate their dedication and knowledge to potential employers, making them more likely to be hired.

However, there are also reasons why people think that high school students aren't ready to commit to a career. One argument is that students may not have had enough life experience to fully understand the demands and responsibilities of a particular career. Additionally, some students may not have had the opportunity to explore different career paths or gain a broad understanding of the world before making a decision.

Despite these concerns, I believe that high school students are capable of committing to a career. While it is true that students may not have had as much life experience as adults, they can still gain valuable insights and knowledge through internships, volunteer work, and other opportunities. Additionally, many high school students are highly motivated and dedicated to their chosen career path, and with the right support and guidance, they can make informed decisions about their future.

In conclusion, committing to a career at a young age can have both advantages and disadvantages. While it can provide a clear direction for future education and job opportunities, it is also important to consider the potential drawbacks, such as a lack of life experience or a limited understanding of different career paths.

86E1F1C251F8,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author reveals that, in the near future, automatic cars that remain capable of running without a human driver are very possible. Although the author presents some negatives of these driverless cars, the positives most definitely overtake the negatives. Driverless cars are an amazing, technologically advanced, useful invention than any user would benefit greatly from. Every type of user, whether it be someone who uses itonce a month or every day, would benefit from attaining a driverless, automatic car. They are coming soon, in the very near future, and there are many good things that society should look forward to whenever they become a reality.

Driverless cars seemed to be such a futuristic idea until automobile companies began creating automatic systems within cars. Although these cars still require a human driver, they are very close to getting to the point where a driver is not necessary. In the article, the author states that cars already made, ""...alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This statement reveals that although the automatic components are very useful and beneficial, the cars still, at this point, require a driver. However, sensors that have been advanced within the last ten years can almost individually run the car. The author states that even though the progress of sensors that can lock the brakes, accelarate the vehicle, and steer the car has been very substantial, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" By stating this, the author opens readers up to the fact that different sensors are being created in order to complete the different tasks and skills that driving requires. Soon enough, within only some years, a few companies have stated that they believe they will have a completely driverless car completed by the year 2020. These completely automatic cars will help and assist users by allowing for better transportation and accounting for more accurate driving techniques.

The invention of these driverless cars will not only assist users of the technological advancement, but will also help to save the environment. The cars that Google cofounder Sergey Brin, ""forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" When the author states this fact, readers can understand that these driverless cars would ultimately change the entire world. By using less fuel, there are less toxic fumes going into the air. Currently, air pollution is a large issue in today's society as a whole. If these driverless cars are invented in the short time that they are predicted to arrive, the world could take a complete turn towards a better ecosystem.

Ultimately, driverless cars seem to be a very positive oncoming invention. As they are already more than halfway towards becoming an actual item, many companies are working extremely hard to bring this idea fully to life. The benefits of more efficient public transportation and easier assistance remain very important and useful to the people of today's society. The fact that these public transportation driverless cars would be better for the ecosystem and allow for less air pollution is yet another reason in which they would benefit greatly everyone and the entire world, in the long run. Driverless cars are not something that people should be afraid of; they are simply just technology being taken to the next level. As many people, such as Sergey Brin, foresee, driverless cars would benefit and take over many daily tasks, help the environment, and solve issues for public transportation.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
233F592248DF,"Cell Phones and Vehicles

In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones at all while in a vehicle. I think this, because even with these new cell phone laws some people still use their cell phones while driving. So with these laws it should make the chance of accidents less possible, and police can write tickets so people are less likely to do it again. Now, all new cars are able to have bluetooth and touch screen and unless you have a very old car that shouldn't be an issue anymore.

However, the reality is, most of the drivers are still using cell phones while driving and I guess it's not that easy for the police to catch them.

With bluetooth you just swipe to pick up a phone call and automatically connect to your car nowadays. Many people tend to think it's not a big deal to just swipe -it takes only a second. I do think so as well. That one second could cost you a life or somebody's life.

What can stop drivers' using cell phones while driving?

The simplest but most difficult is each driver has a strong will not to touch the phone during driving. Police can set more camera (not only at the traffic lights but on normal roads) so that cameras can catch drivers who are using the phones. Once ""Restriction on cell phones while driving"" law becomes nationwide, cell phones should be made to get disabled near the driving seat once car starts moving.

I will follow the law once I start driving and hope all the drivers consider about the risk of using the cell phone while driving.          ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
AC3111702C95,"Hey, so for this essay, I gotta talk about first impressions and how they work in society. Like, have you ever met someone and they totally gave you a bad vibe, but then you get to know them and they're actually cool? That's what I'm gonna write about.

So, first impressions are like, super important, right? Like, they can make or break how people see you. If you walk into a room and people think you're weird or whatever, it can be hard to change their minds. But, on the other hand, if you come in all confident and stuff, they might think you're cool and wanna be your friend. It's like, the old saying goes, ""You never get a second chance to make a first impression.""

But, here's the thing, sometimes people can change their minds about you. Like, if you have a bad first impression with someone, but then you start talking to them and you're like, really funny or nice, they might start to see you in a different light. It's like, they might not judge you based on one little thing you did or said.

One example of this is when I first met my best friend in school. I was like, totally nervous and didn't know what to say, but then we started talking about music and we realized we had like, all the same favorite bands. So, even though I gave her a bad first impression, we were able to change it and become really close friends.

Another thing that can help change a negative first impression is if you're able to show people that you're not what they think you are. Like, if you're in a group and someone thinks you're the quiet one, but then you start talking and you're like, really loud and funny, they might start to think you're cooler than they thought.

But, sometimes it's not easy to change a first impression. Like, if someone thinks you're a jerk or something, it might be hard to change their mind. In that case, you might just have to prove it to them over time. Like, you could show them that you're nice and stuff by being friendly and stuff.

So, in conclusion, first impressions are important,",1,llama2_chat,Task: Examine how the concept of first impressions is viewed in society and analyze ways in which an individual can change a negative first impression. Consider case examples and include a conclusion.,7
6186246910E1,"Hey, so like, I know this might be a pretty controversial topic, but I think students should be able to graduate in three years instead of four. I mean, think about it, four years is a looong time to be in school, especially when you're like, 13 or 14 years old.

First of all, let's talk about the benefits of graduating early. For one thing, it would save families a ton of money on tuition fees. My parents are always stressing about how expensive college is, and I'm like, ""Dude, if we could just graduate early, we could save so much money!"" And think about it, if we're done with school earlier, we could start working or pursuing our passions sooner. That would be like, super cool.

Another thing is, when you're in school for four years, you can get a little bit burnt out. Like, I know I'm only in 8th grade right now, but I'm already feeling the stress of school. If we could graduate early, we could take a break and focus on other things we're interested in, like sports or music or volunteering. That would be way more fulfilling than just sitting in a classroom all day.

And let's not forget about the academic benefits. When you graduate early, you can start college earlier too. That means you can get a head start on your degree and finish it faster. That's like, a total win-win situation. Plus, you'll have more time to focus on your studies and get better grades.

Now, I know some people might be like, ""But what about the social aspect of school? Won't you miss out on all the fun stuff?"" And yeah, I get that. But think about it, if we graduate early, we can still hang out with our friends and have fun, we just won't have to do it in the context of school. We can like, create our own fun stuff and make our own memories.

Student would be more efficient in order to accomplish what the project should be and what the project should actually look like to the teacher.

However to some students it may be better to design a project based off of how they would want the project to look and how they want their project setup instead of what teacher would want. This would give the teacher the opportunity to see what the student is capable of doing on their own. This option would represent what the students have actually learned over their break. It also will reflect how the students take it upon themselves to show what they know in a creative way based off of the projects topic.

However, student-designed projects would lead to some students not putting as much effort and creativity in their projects. Students will do the bare-minimum when they have the option to take it upon themselves to do an assignment for school. Some students may take it upon themselves to go above and beyond for their student-designed project. However some students may take advantage and use it as an opportunity to be lazy and unproductive on this assignment.

Students would not have as much motivation if they have the option to take it upon themselves to create a project over their summer break. If this assignment was left up to students to design their own projects some would not take it as serious as should and some would. The students who won't take it as serious as they should would have an unorganized project or they just wouldn't do the project at all.

A benefit of summer projects being teacher-designed would be the fact that all students had one layout or structure for how their projects are supposed to be. It would be easier for the teachers to grade and look over all projects efficiently. It would also be easier for the students to follow an assigned rubric or setup for a project. Instead of designing it on their own

Teacher-designed project would be easier for students because they know what the teacher expects their project to be like in order to get a good grade on it. This will make the students projects way more neat and organized.

Think, can cars really drive on their own, and what if the cars crashes who's at fault?

The idea of self driving cars scare many that maybe why it's actually illegal to even test computer-driven cars, stated in passage 9. This is because it isn't a hundred percent safe, though Google has cars that have been driven for a million miles without a crash, stated in passage 2. I think it would make a big change if cars could drive themselves. There would probably still be car accidents, but there would be as many.

Self driving cars would have many pros because there could be less texting and driving, which means less accidents. There would also be less drunk drivers which mean leass accidents, and there could also be less people dying. This would be a deal breaker for parents they could actuallly monator where their kids go. There could be less accidents among teens and in general.

Technology that can recognize emotions in a class room could be used to help students who are bored or confused. The ability to tell when someone is bored or lost is a very valuable tool for a teacher. This would change everything about how we learn. That is the problem. We could change a system that has put people on the moon.

The school system we have right now works to educate people very well. Changing our system in such an extreme manor would have equally extreme consequences. We may fail to educate the generation this is tried on, or we may fail to make people as strong as they are now.

Another problem is privacy. This technology would take away any hope of hiding ones feelings. If I am angry at a classmate and this technology tells the teacher, then everyone could be forced into a situation no one wants to be in. We have the freedom of speech and the right to remain silent. This technology would force us to share more than we might want. This could destroy relationships within schools hamper eduaction.

Another factor that must be considered is cost. How much would it be for one student to have one? Howmuch for all the students? Many schools struggle to provide learning materials and having risky technology that costs so much could limit a tight budget even more.

DCCDEC3F06CB,"Imagine a world where emotional reading is performed by robots, and raw human emotion is simply binary code. This could be a reality if the classroom is converted into such a world. The use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable, due to the lack of the software's ability to decipher verbal emotion, the ability of humans to naturally perform the same techniques as the software, and the cost effectiveness of this kind of software within a classroom setting.

The first reason why the use of the FACS within the classroom would not be valuable is due to the inability of the software to understand verbal emotion. When a student is confused and or emotional about a topic, often they will express this through verbal communication. The FACS is not able to register this kind of emotion, at least not this early in it's development. As cited in paragraph six of the article, "" 'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers will need to understand that, too.' "" This statement also brings about the issue of emotional expression not on the face, including body language and stature. These reasons defend the idea that FACS is not a valuable software for the classroom.

FACS also is not valuable because it is not diverse enough in its usage nor its abilities. Teachers and peers can easily spot emotions just as easily, and often more accurately, than this machine. As cited in paragraph five of the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day."" This would lead this invention's discovery to be unneeded and unneccesary, unless in it's applications of the distinguishment of the emotions of century old art pieces.

The software itself would not be cost effective, with the extravagance of it's research. As cited in paragraph one, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam."" This two Professers are of very renowned within the hierarchy of education, and the software itself is a product of the two researchers. This would lead one to believe that the software would not be cost-effective, especially within a state-funded school district.

To synthesize, the Facial Action Coding System would not be a valuable tool within the classroom because it lacks the ability to de-code other sensory based emotional expressions, can be replaced by humans, and is far too expesive. Although the software is useful, it is not practical nor diverse enough to be used within the classroom. If the FACS could be more efficient, especially with it's purpose, it might be a candidate for a positve addition to the classroom, but presently, it serves no new purpose.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

When you want to make a decision on something it can sometimes be hard to pick what you want to do especially if you have multiple options. When you go to others though you can get advice from them such as what you might want to do for a project of even something with school. So others options can help you decide what you want to do and, when you get their options too you can come up with something more interesting.

Let's say I am writing a paper it's better to go to someone and get help and get options on if my idea is interesting or not. When you go to people for options like that they tell you based on what they think if your paper is interesting, then after you go to that person you can also go to someone else and get their feedback as well. When it comes to doing all of that you can figure out what you want to do or your paper and you have feedback from multiple people to help you figure things out to write a good paper.

Now let's say you are doing a project and let's say you are in science and you are doing a project and you can ether do it on metamorphic rocks or you can do a projects about poultion. When you do this project you can go to people and ask on if they like the idea and figure out on how you make your project interesting and they can you give you ideas based off what they are saying you should do. Then once you are done getting all your feedback you can go home and firgure out on what you would want to do like you could go home and make a project about polluion and put water in a container and put trash and oils in it to show it being pullited. And that could be your feedback from your friends to figure out your project.

Now let's say you have an outfit picked out but you don't know how it looks so you can ask someone or multiple people their opion on what they think about it. When you ask people about what they think it can help you because you can then find other things to be able to fix it. When you ask for other peoples opions they truly do matter because they can help you.

So therefore peoples opions are a very important thing because getting diffrent opions on things can impact and help you. Because if you don't have feedback you wouldn't get as many good ideas, or help on things. Also sometimes opions are the things that help you most because they give you better ideas or ways of thinking about something.

9C76CF46D791,"As an 8th grader, I believe that education in high school is incredibly important for setting a strong foundation for a student's future career path. However, I also think that it's not a good idea for students to commit to a specific career too early on in their high school years.

Research has shown that students who are passionate about their studies and have a clear direction in mind for their future tend to perform better academically and have higher graduation rates. On the other hand, students who are unsure of their career goals may struggle to stay motivated and engaged in their schoolwork. This can lead to lower grades and a higher risk of dropping out of school altogether.

But here's the thing: high school is a crucial time for exploration and discovery. Students should be encouraged to try out different subjects, clubs, and activities to find what truly interests them. By doing so, they can gain valuable skills and experiences that will help them identify their strengths and passions.

Moreover, committing to a career too early on can have negative effects on a student's mental and physical health. For example, if a student decides to pursue a career in a particular field, they may feel pressured to sacrifice their social life, hobbies, and other interests to focus solely on their studies. This can lead to burnout, stress, and a general sense of unhappiness.

Furthermore, high school is a time of immense change and growth, both physically and emotionally. Students are developing their identities, building relationships, and learning how to navigate the complexities of adolescence. Rushing into a career decision can hinder this process and limit their potential for personal growth.

So, what can we do to prevent high school students from committing to a specific career too early on? Firstly, schools can provide more resources and support for students to explore their interests and passions. This can include guest speakers, internships, and mentorship programs. Secondly, parents and guardians can encourage their children to take risks, try new things, and not be afraid to change their minds.

The schools in places that have already implemented distance learning have made their students more productive. In Europe, countries such as Switzerland have a general happiness rate of 90% versus the US, which has a general happiness rate of 72%. School takes up 7 hours, a good portion of a regular person's day. Without that 7 hours spent in a classroom, students have more time to get tasks done. The more time to get tasks done, the more their productivity increases and their contributions to society as a whole increase. Students in these places have been inventing potential cures for diseases that have been incurable since the birth of the human race. Having this time would allow people to fix the world's problems, such as world hunger, war, and mass genocides.

Not only does distance learning increase productivity, but it decreases the teacher and student mayhem in classrooms. According to Professor Generic_Name, a college professor at the University of Virginia, ""I love most of my students, but some of them are just so chaotic, they disrupt the learning experience of everyone else."" As he said, some students are so unruly that they turn a classroom into their personal chaos playground. Distance learning would make it so that everyone could learn without needless distractions of others not wanting to learn. Having teachers who teach different ways is much appreciated, except for when they don't teach. Students all over the United States claim to have at least one teacher in their schedule who doesn't actually teach the material. A teacher at Generic_School, Generic_Name, gives students work and then looks at her phone the rest of the class, although she is helpful if you ask her. The separation of students from the physical school would give teachers like these who are actually helpful when you ask them by themselves the opportunity to truly teach the material to their students.

As these teachers have received this opportunity, the world is moving forward; distance learning will help move the world forward together. As UN president Generic_Name said"" The world is more united because of technology."" As we improve technology such as would allow for distance learning, world peace becomes a distinct possibility. News spread across the world in an instant, anyone can talk to anyone anywhere, and different communities can share their ideas. Distance learning, by separating us from school, would put us in touch with the world. This could be opportunities to enjoy nature, talk to somebody from another part of the world, and much more. According to Professor Generic_Name of the College of Indiana, ""Distance learning is the further development of technology, and of that our unification."" As technology develops, the world will be able to work together more. The world will move into the future and solve its problems together as a whole, instead of a bunch of separate countries.

The world that is moving into the future must look into its past and question, 'How can we be more productive, have less disorder in the classroom, and unite?' This, distance learning, is the answer. Distance learning is not just a question of where classes take place, but of our future. The path to unity is through distance learning. The world is going through some trying times as of right now, so uniting is the only option for the survival of the plantet and the human race.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3
021B23C3C2C6,"Research has shown that many students have had the option to take online school, but have struggled with it for multiple reasons. Although some people agree that online school is beneficial for students, most would disagree that the negative effects outweigh the positive effects on this issue because students need face to face interaction with one another, having access to the teacher first hand is more efficient than not, and being in a classroom environment is better than a home environment.

First, having face to face interaction with other students helps build social skills. Gaining social skills is a skill everyone needs in the real world. Schools helps to teach this skill efficiently. For example, students need to be able to make eye contact when talking to someone. At school there a many times when a student is forced to make eye contact,¬†whether it's when another classmate or teacher is talking to them, or the student must make a presentation in front of the class. This skill is needed in real life for things such as job interviews or just simply having a conversation with someone. Another example, would be public speaking. Students everywhere struggle with public speaking for the simple fact that they are not made to do it. Online school makes this even worse, with the fact that there is no way to public speak with online school. Teachers grade public speaking on presentations and oral exams in the classroom. Practicing this will improve student's grades. It also improves one's social skills whether the student has to make a speech in front of many other people, or just carrying a conversation with a group of people. Public speaking helps to build confidence and leadership in a student's life and is crucial for the real world. To close, a students social skills are built upon in school and a classroom environment, online school does not teach or help this skill in any way.

Next, having access to the teacher is more efficient than not for multiple reasons. For example, sometimes a question or direction on an assignment is unclear. A student taking online school will struggle because they do not have access to the teacher to explain in more detail what they want the student to do. Teachers explain more in depth what they want the student to do, and are more helpful this way. Having the teacher's assistance first hand helps the student know exactly what to do and know exactly what the teacher wants. Another example would be if the student needs one on one help. Often times students struggle and need one on one help with the teacher. Online school cannot offer tutoring or the kind of guidance a student in this situation needs. Having the teacher on hand helps calm anxiety, frustration, and struggle the student may have. Sometimes it just takes the teacher explaining it one more time for the student to catch on. If a student in this situation is taking online school, it may cause more anxiety, struggle, and frustration and could cause the student to give up. It's easier, more reliable, and more efficient for a student when they have the help of the teacher in person.

Furthermore, being in a classroom environment is better than a home environment. Being in the classroom improves so many things for a student. For example, at home there are so many distractions for a student, but being in the classroom helps keep the student on track and focused. At home there are things such as electronics and chores that could be used as excuses to get away from school work. In the classroom the student has very limited to no access at all to these things. The classroom environment pushes the student to work and accomplish everything they are required to do. The teacher helps with this in the sense that they may ban electronics and other distractions until the student's work is done. Another example that the classroom is better than a home environment is having a time structure that keeps the student on task. At home the student may sleep in or decide to put off their school work. At school the student has a time they need to arrive at school and get started on their work. There are also deadlines that keep the student on track and motivating them to do the work they need to do. Schedules are an important part of a student's school life because it keeps them focused on the task at hand, and motivating them to work at what they need to do. When the students work at school rather than home, they are motivated and kept on track to reach their goal.

To conclude, most agree that online school is not beneficial because the student learns social skills needed for real life in school, having the teacher in person and on hand is much more effective than not, and a classroom environment pushes and motivates the student more than a home environment. As time goes on and online school gains more popularity, students will lose some of the basic skills needed for real life that they would have learned at school. We need to take action now more than ever, and enforce school over online school for the well being of students.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9
EEEEC24C9AE7,"Sure, I'll give it a try! Here's my essay on Ralph Waldo Emerson:

Ralph Waldo Emerson was a famous American essayist, lecturer, and poet who lived in the 19th century. He is known for his inspiring and thought-provoking writings that encourage individuals to think for themselves and live a meaningful life. Through his essays and lectures, Emerson conveyed a message that is still relevant in modern society.

In his text, Emerson emphasizes the importance of individualism and self-reliance. He believes that people should not conform to societal norms and expectations, but rather, they should follow their own path and pursue their passions. This message is particularly relevant in today's world where people are often pressured to choose a single profession and stick to it for the rest of their lives. Emerson argues that this narrow focus can lead to stagnation and a lack of growth, both personally and professionally.

Moreover, Emerson's message applies to the impact of people on their communities. When individuals focus on only one profession, they can become isolated and disconnected from the world around them. This can lead to a lack of diversity and innovation in various fields, as well as a lack of empathy and understanding among people. On the other hand, when people are free to pursue their passions and interests, they are more likely to contribute positively to their communities and make a meaningful impact.

In conclusion, Emerson's message encourages people to approach learning and new opportunities with an open mind and a willingness to take risks. By embracing individualism and self-reliance, people can grow and develop in ways that are authentic and fulfilling. While it can be challenging to balance the demands of society with personal aspirations, the benefits of following one's own path far outweigh the risks. As Emerson himself said, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.""

Overall, Emerson's message is a powerful reminder that life is not a predetermined path, but rather a journey that we must navigate ourselves. By embracing our unique talents and passions, we can make",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

There are all kinds of different places you go when you are a Seagoing Cowboy. There are also some jobs you have to do like cleaning out the stables and feeding the animals, but it is a lot of fun.

The text states "" He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" It will make you feel free being on a boat. The Part that is the best is getting to see all the wounderful sights. You could go to China, Italy, Greece, and other places. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you can exlpore different places of the world. You get to meet different people and see how their coulture is different.

The second best thing is all the free time you have after the animals get droped off. The text states, "" The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time."" There are all kinds of games you can play, so you will not be bored.

It is fun getting to interact with people from different cultures. It is also really cool to be on a boat with your friends and animals. All you have to do is clean out the animals housing area and give them food and water. You also get to interact with the animals when you feed and water them.

ce58dd81,"Cars are like beneficial disadvantages they allow you to arrive at your destination in a short amount of time, but they add to the world's pollution growing issue. Individuals in every single part of the world own cars and millions of cars are on our streets and highways daily. Whether it is to comute to work or visit a friend in the next town over, individuals are constantly on the road. While cars do simplify our lives today, in the near future cars will become a burden, due to the amount of pollution they produce and the stress they cause upon individuals. Limiting car usage in all parts of the world will bring more joy and persistent smiles.

Cars play a dramatic role in the amount of pollution that is in our air today. Which is also essential for our survival. Limiting car usage will decrease the amount of pollution we have today and the disgusting greenhouse gas emissions. ""Up to 50 percent"" of green house gas emissions alone are caused by carintense areas in the United States acknowledged by Elisabeth Rosenthal, in the article "" In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars "". Furthermore, in the capital of France due to ""intensifying smog 60 percent"" of the individuals were in a severe traffic jam explained by Robert Duffer, in "" "". The smog was caused by cold nights and warm days and the warmer layer of air imprisoning car emissions and pollution pollution being caused by over usage of cars, meaning car usage should be limited if not halted all at once.

Individuals participating in events like Carfree day and living in towns like Vauban tend to be a lot more joyful and enthusiastic. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said by an individual named Heidrun Walter, who moved to Vauban for a more jubilating experience. Cars add stress due to having to be stuck in agonising traffic and having to pay for ridiculous gas prices. Also, by limiting car usage you'll witness and hear more individuals enjoying themselves walking the street, and ""the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drowning out the occasional distant motor."" described by Robert Duffer, in "" In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars "". Evenmore so, by abandoning your vehicle at home you won't have to deal with enebidable traffic and ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" brought up by Andrew Selsky, in source 3 "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "". Carless stress less.

Before saying cars are benefitial think of all the disadvanteges that they hold. All the disadvanteges out weigh the advantages. Pollution no matter how big or small is a humungous issue that can be prevented little by little by limiting car usage. Also, limited smiles will become persistent smiles if you limit car usage across the nation. More smiles and less cars is the way to go.",0,train_essays,,7
B482A00A85FC,"It is so hard to believe that our world today has come to cars that can drive themselves, or drive around for us humans. The future is here and it's time to quit holding these new inventions off and time to start accepting that the worlds technology today is limitless. People in our world today are becoming so intellegent that they can invent anything they set thier minds to.

First of all, if these car companies have been working on cars that can drive themselves since the 1900's, why should they stop now? Is giving up really worth throwing away 70+ years of hard work and dedication towards inventing smart cars that can drive themselves? NO, don't give up, continue to strive for a better and also safer future for the world today and generations to come.

Additionally, not only are these cars really cool and mind blowing, but very helpful to certain people. Imagine someone who has no arms, legs or even a disability that keeps them from driving and thier dream is to be able to drive a car one day, or even just to be able to sit in the drivers seat of an actual moving vehical. Well, with these new cars, their dreams can come true.

Finally, safety is the major key for these vehicals. No one is going to want to buy these vehicals or even be in one, if they aren't safe. As soon as companies make sure that these vehicals are 100% safe for families to be in and drive without the risk of a bad injury, there is no doubt that people will be all over these new cars.

The worlds future holds many more great inventions that either haven't been thought of, or are being carefully worked on and studied right now. There is no doubt that these cars are the next big thing. So many people will be inspired to create more things if they know someone could create a safe vehical to drive itself, then they can create an invention even better.",0,persuade_corpus,,7
41CE9804B226,"Teachers and students believe that it was a not really good idea to take and teach classes online because is more difficult to teach and teachers need to do more work ,for the students and that some students don't doing anything if we take classes online and not all the students have computer or internet thas why i'm thinking that is not a really good idea the classes online it was difficult for everyone when think in the positive and negative things and we can see that is not a easy idea and have more negative thing is a more difficult way than go to the school and take classes in school like always because online is more difficult and more expensive because we need to buy computer if the school don't have and we need to put internet if we don't have too so in my opinion classes online is a more difficult way.

First, one reason is that l think that is more difficult for the teachers if they need to teach the classes online because they need to do more work than they did in the school. For example, if the students have classes online the teachers have the responsabilitie to every day teach the classes for many students and put differences themes and homeworks for seventh differences classes and they really not if the students stay really understand every theme because is more difficult to not if the all students understand thas why l think is more difficult take and teach classes online and sometimes the teachers can do to much in her houses because they have thinks to do some teachers have daugters or sons to take care and is more difficult to do everthing in home.

Additionally, some students don't have computer and it was a problem if the classes are online and sometimes some school bring computers for the students but it does matter because is a really big responsibility to have a computer that is not yours. For example, most the students don't have internet in her houses to take classes online thas why when we have only the option to take classes only some students prefer no continue studie anymore in the school because it was difficult and no all the paents have the money for buy a computer or put internet in her house and more difficulty when parents have more than one child that need to studied online and what happen with the little childs that don't have idea to use a computer and his parents don't have the time to help his son. is many devanges that we have if we take classes online.

However, no everyone agrees with this position some people claim that take classes online is more easy and better than take in school because we are in home we not have the neccesary to wake up early every single morning and we more comfort if we stay all day in home we no need to expensive money in food because we be stay all the day in home. but thas the only good way that we have to take classes in home, so for me l think some students don't do anything if take classes online because don't have the responsibility to do his works and homeworks or is possible too that the many students decide no continue studie because have classes online and if more easy for they stop continue with classes online his parents sometimes don't have the time for always help when we don't understand something and we never see the teachers and we have seventh differences teachers so thas difficult for take classes online.

ln conclucion, we can see that are many reasons that is difficulty to take classes online the online good way that we have is that we can be stay in home,but in my conclution is more difficult to take classes online because is difficult for the teacher becauses they need to put and do everthing online, and for the students because is difficult too and expensive for students and parents and some parents don't have the time to see if his son stay doing everthing that the teacher put because they don't have contact with the teacher and some person can' use computers too thas a way that we need to think that some students, teachers, and parents can use this thinks like computer or phones so is more easy to go and take classes normal in schoool this is my conclucion and maybe many students can be agree or desagree with my opinion but thas what i think.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
llama_70b_v1757,"I think meditation and mindfulness practices should not be included in schools. The first reason is that it's a waste of time. We should be focusing on learning and not sitting around doing nothing. It's not gonna help us pass our tests or get good grades. Also, it's not fair to those who don't want to participate. Some people might feel uncomfortable or just plain bored. It's not right to force them to do something they don't want to.

Another reason is that it's not proven to work. There's no concrete evidence that it helps with stress or concentration. It's just a bunch of hippy-dippy nonsense. We should be focusing on real ways to improve our mental health, like counseling or therapy. That stuff is proven to work.

In addition, it's a distraction. If we're meditating, we're not paying attention to what we're supposed to be learning. We're not gonna be able to focus on our schoolwork if we're constantly being told to breathe deeply and clear our minds. It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.

Furthermore, it's not fair to the teachers. They have enough to worry about, trying to teach us and prepare us for exams. They don't need the extra stress of trying to get us to sit still and quiet for 10 minutes a day. It's not their job to be our personal yoga instructors.

In conclusion, meditation and mindfulness practices have no place in schools. It's a waste of time, it's not proven to work, it's a distraction, and it's not fair to the teachers. We should be focusing on real ways to improve our mental health and academic performance, not sitting around doing nothing.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Some schools have implemented meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day.

B1EFFE527751,"All teachers and principals know that students use their cell phones during class even though it's not permitted. Why keep it a secret any longer? I think that the principal should choose policy A because the parent might need to get a-hold of the student during school for something extremely important, the student will most likely use their cell phone less during class from using it in their free periods, and there is no use not letting the student use their cell phone during a free period if they're not doing anything to begin with. These are some reasons why I think the principal should go with policy A.

First, the parent might need to get a-hold of the student during school for something extremely important. Something could have come up like a death or odd news. Another example would be that the student could have left something at home and they decide to text one of their parents to bring it to school for them. One more example would be that there is an unexpected club meeting of some sort that came up that day, so the student should be able to text one of their parents during the free period to let them know that they will be home late and give them a heads up notice. This is one reason why I think the principal should go with policy A.

Second, by letting students use their phones during lunch and free periods, that would give them the chance to just do something for fun and to get using their phones out of their system. It would let them have their time with there phone, so they wouldn't use it during class. It this manner, it is being both fair to the teacher, and fair to the student. Everybody gets their way. Yes, I think it is incredibly rude for a student to use their phone instead of listening to the teacher, but I also think it is unfair for the student to not have any person freedom during class. This is another reason why I think the principal should go with policy A.

Last but not least, I think that the principal should go with policy A because if the student has a free period, and they can do absolutely anything they want to, why not let them use their phones? There's no real harm in it. If they had a free period and had nothing to do because they forgot their book or already finished their homework, whatever the case me be, they should be able to use their phones to text or to just have fun. This is my last reason why I think the principal should go with policy A.

To sum up, I think the principal should go with policy A because the parent may need to get a-hold with the student for something extremely important, the student will most likely use their cell phone less during class from using it in their free periods, and there is no use not letting the student use their cell phone during a free period if they're not doing anything to begin with.

Asking for advice is always a great idea if you are stuck with a decision.

first of all, you have a better chance of making the better decision when asking others for advice on your decision. When you only ask one person you only have one piece of advice but when you ask multiple people you have multiple ideas like if you ask three people fro advice and one person says one¬†thing and then the other two have the same idea then you would go with the two people¬†with the same¬†idea because they have the advice that the majority agreed on. you also get way more support when asking multiple people because they all want to help out with the¬†decisions you make.

Its very nice to help people who get stuck or fall and can't get up and you would help them they would think wow what a very nice kid. I have to say I have done it before help someone up when they have fallen. They have looked at me with a great big smile and thanked me. I just love seeing big smiles on peoples faces, it brightens my day and makes me feel like I have done something right for once.

Its so easy to through something away weather than littering. I mean come on it is not that hard to get up and through away your garbage and if your to lazy to do that well then I would say wow that is just not good. Your to lazy to through something away but your not lazy when it comes to going somewhere with friends or texting. When you get a texts your like oh someone wants to talk to me I better respond.

9B45D0A9E4C0,"Do you think that drivers should or shouldn't be able to use their phone in the car? I think that drivers should not use their phone in the car. A lot of people get into accidents and some leads to death just because your texting or doing other things on your phone. We all know that cellphones can be really distracting but putting them away can save a lot of lives. Not having your phone out is the same as not having accidents.

One reason why you should not have cell phones is because a lot things can happen which is bad. For example You can be arguing with somebody on the phone and not see that the light turned red and keep going and a truck come and hit you. Arguing while texting can get you into a really bad situation also. While texting you will take your eyes off the road and just like that somebody can cross the street or you can run into something. If the call or text is urgent just pull the car over so you can reply or answer and nobody gets hurt.

Cell Phones are really distractive in way that you think you can drive and text but really you are in a bad crash. Your brain can tell you to do one thing at a time and when you try and do both, you panic and that can cause a crash. Both driving and texting needs concentrations so when you try to focus on both your mind gets overwhelmed and you crash. Once you get in the car just put the phone away and out of sight. Focusing on the road is the main key on the road than texting.

Texting while driving is very dangerous. You need your hands for texting so that requires you to take your hand of the wheel and the car can not be controlled. Not having a controlled car can lead to accidents. Being distracted is the main point by how dangerous texting and driving is. Texting and driving is so dangerous that is way more severe than a drunk driver.

Finally, with proven facts, texting and driving is the most dangerous thing to do. There is so many lives getting costed just so you can send a message. Texting and driving is also against the law so unless you wanna pay, put the phone away. Put the phones away because you can hit anybody loved ones and actually kill them and you wouldn't want the same to happen to you. Putting the phones away is saving one life at a time.

falcon_180b_v1_805,"I am a grade 12 student, and I would like to present my opinion on the implementation of policies that allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. In my personal opinion, I believe that this practice should not be implemented in schools.

Firstly, I think that students should have the responsibility to manage their own grades and attendance. If parents are always monitoring their children, it might make it difficult for students to learn how to be accountable for their own actions. As grade 12 students, we are almost adults and should be responsible for our own academic performance.

Secondly, I think that this practice might create unnecessary pressure on students. If parents are constantly checking their children's grades, students might feel stressed and pressured to perform well. This pressure might have a negative impact on their mental health and could lead to anxiety and depression.

Lastly, I believe that students should have some privacy when it comes to their academic performance. It is important for students to learn how to manage their own grades and attendance without the constant monitoring of their parents. If parents are always watching their children, it might make it difficult for students to learn how to be independent.

In conclusion, I do not support the implementation of policies that allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. Students should be responsible for their own academic performance and should have the privacy to manage their own grades and attendance. It is important for students to learn how to be independent and accountable for their own actions.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Some schools have implemented policies that allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online.

8B2CB9C1F189,"Ever think of just staying home one day and not deal with school for once, well you can. Some school offer learning distance to attend classes from home, by online or a video conferencing. This is a good thing to students if they have health problems, can get a better sleeping schedule, and students will feel safer at home then school. But some people will say that¬†staying home will make them lazier and not do the work, but that's not the case here. We want the students to focus on their goal and if this is the way then let it be.

There are a lot of kids that have health problem that need to be check every couple of hours or need to take pills every couple of hours a day, if not check they could be in trouble and send to the hostile. At home the parents can help them to remember to take there pills or do their daily check up at home or to the doctor office. Appointments is another problem that we all face and hate. There are times when you can't get the time you want, so you will not miss any school hours, that doesn't work all the time. But when you are taking online classes you don't need to worry about that, you can just take the class later that day or take your computer to the appointment since they take forever to finish and work on it there.

Sleep is very important to health, because it will make you feel ready to do stuff and help you focus on your work better. When you tell your kids to go to bed or your kids are old enough to go to bed all by them self, half the time they don't go to sleep right away. They might be on their phone all night or they have a sleeping problem that takes time to fall asleep. When this happens they don't want to get up in the morning, late or miss to the school bus and fall asleep in class. Taking online classes from home will let you pick the time you want to do the classes, so that you will have energy to finish them easier¬†and not past out ever second of the day.

What is the most important thing in the world, yourself, your life, your kids, or family? It can be anything, but when you are a mother or father¬†your kids safely is more important then your own. School should be a fun time, learning cool stuff you didn't even know about and a safe place to feel comfortable of being yourself, not being scared to go to school because another kid is bullying you, or a teacher is sexual to you. Parents will do anything to protect their kids. So when your kid is not feeling safe in school, the best thing the parent or kid will think about is take online school, if the problem at school is too much to deal with. They will feel more clam, comfortable and safer taking the online classes at home.

Therefore, those are the reasons why online classes are benefit for people that are too sick to go to school, a better sleeping schedule and most importantly being safe.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
9E54D33AF6CD,"Many students everyday struggle to find the motivation to get out of bed and go to school. But, what if there was a way for students to receive the education they need, while still in the comfort of their home. Some schools are now offering distant learning so students can attend class at home. Distant learning is a great option to offer because it fits into the students schedule, it is more comfortable, and there is no transportation needed.

For both college and high school¬†students, timing is everything. As an employed junior in high school¬†I can understand the struggles of simply running out of time due to school. Many students have other events to attend such as practice for a sport, a club, volunteer work, and other time consuming activities. It can be hard to fit these things into one's schedule after an eight to ten hour school day. For this reason, distant learning is a great option. It allows students to work at their own pace and still have time to do other activities. For many students it can be hard to balance life and getting their education all at once. For example, my mother was a college student and was still able to balance having four kids, going to work eight hour shifts, an earning her bachelors degree all thanks to distant learning. Being unable to attend day-time classes can be a struggle, but because of online school busy students are not excluded from learning.

Many students battle personal issues day to day and struggle to still get up the next morning to go to school. Being in an unfamiliar environment every day for hours can be uncomfortable and make one anxious. For example, a friend of mine struggled with social anxiety. This mental issue caused her to have days where she would not go to school because her anxiety held her back like a boulder on a sheet of paper. This resulted in her not knowing information and consequently receiving low grades. If she had the option of distant learning it would have helped her to be able to learn while still overcoming her anxiety all in her own comfort. Unfortunately, many students world wide are bullied. Bullying causes them to not want to come to school and makes them constantly uncomfortable when they are in school. For this reason, distant learning would be beneficial. Students can still learn while comfortable and safe in their own home.

Most high school¬†students take the school bus as everyday transportation. But, some days students oversleep and for that reason they miss the bus and are unable to get to school to learn. For example, a friend of mine has to be at his bus stop at six in the morning. The days he misses the bus are the days he is unable to get his education. Transportation tends to be a barrier when it comes to being able to learn everyday. Having access online can allow students to still be educated without being physically present. Some college students have particular colleges they would like to attend, but are unable to because of the distance. There are many people who drive hours a day to learn and sometimes are tardy or miss the class. Having distant learning as an option can benefit many students who simply can not be physically present everyday.

Yes, being physically present is important and may have social benefits; however, having class at ones fingertips can be very beneficial. Students will not be excluded from learning because they were late, did not complete an assignment in a timely manner, or were uncomfortable in school. Having distant learning as an option can benefit many future graduates by allowing them to learn even through everyday struggles.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

9664D9C4C5F9,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that giving students the choice to elect whether to take a music, drama, or art class is an important aspect of education. This choice allows students to explore their interests and talents, and can have a positive impact on their academic performance and overall well-being.

Firstly, allowing students to choose their own elective classes gives them the opportunity to pursue their interests and passions. Music, drama, and art are all creative and expressive fields that can provide students with a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. By giving students the chance to choose their own classes, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated to learn, which can lead to better academic performance.

Secondly, elective classes can also have a positive impact on a student's overall well-being. Participating in creative activities has been shown to reduce stress and improve mental health. By giving students the choice to take a music, drama, or art class, they are more likely to find an activity that they enjoy and that helps them to relax and unwind.

Finally, elective classes can also help students to develop important skills that are not typically taught in core subjects. For example, music classes can help students to develop their listening skills and their ability to work in a group, while drama classes can help them to develop their communication skills and their ability to think critically. By giving students the choice to take an elective class, they are more likely to find an activity that will help them to develop these skills and prepare them for success in the future.

In conclusion, I believe that giving students the choice to elect whether to take a music, drama, or art class is an important aspect of education. By allowing students to pursue their interests and passions, reduce stress, and develop important skills, we can help them to succeed academically and personally. As an eighth-grade student, I urge my school to consider implementing this policy and giving students the opportunity to choose their own elective classes.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,7
CAC6822F740C,"Hey, Mrs. Johnson!  I'm here to write about whether or not cell phones should be allowed in classrooms.  I know, I know, it's a controversial topic, but hear me out.

First of all, let's talk about the pros of having cell phones in classrooms.  One of the biggest advantages is that they can be super helpful for learning. Like, you can look up stuff on the internet, or use apps to help you study for tests.  And, like, you can use them to take notes, which is way easier than writing everything down by hand.  Plus, you can play educational games on them, which can make learning more fun. 

But,  there are also some cons to having cell phones in classrooms.  For one thing, they can be super distracting.  Like, you can get sucked into social media or games, and forget what you're supposed to be learning.  And, like, it's not fair to the kids who don't have cell phones, 'cause they get left behind.  Plus, there's the risk of cyberbullying or, like, getting hacked or something. 

So,  I think the decision to allow cell phones in classrooms should be based on the teacher's discretion.  Like, if they think it'll help the students learn, they should let them use them.  But,  if they think it'll be too distracting, they should probably ban them. 

In conclusion,  cell phones can be useful in classrooms, but they can also be distracting.  It's up to the teachers to decide what's best for their students.  And,  I'm gonna go finish my math homework now. 

I hope that makes sense, Mrs. Johnson! *nervous smile",1,llama2_chat,Task: Evaluate the pros and cons of allowing cell phones to be used in classrooms.,0
789FBEBEAA5A,"I think students should not be required to take an extracurricular activity for multiple reasons. My reasons are that teachers assign too much homework, it's not ""extra""-curricular if it's required, and students shouldn't be required to stay at school after dismissal.

First, teachers assign too much homework. Often I have to work all the way from when I get home to dinner, and then from after dinner to bedtime, just to finish all the homework that teachers give me. If I had to do after-school stuff on top of that, every day, I would never have time to finish anything, let alone do anything fun.

Next, it's not ""extra""-curricular if it's required. The term ""extracurricular"" literally means ""beyond the curriculum"". If students are required to do extracurricular activities, then the activities become part of the curriculum, and are therefore no longer ""extra""-curricular.

Finally, students shouldn't be required to stay at school after dismissal. If students just want to go home after the end of a long day, they shouldn't be required to stay after school if they haven't done anything wrong. If students are required to stay after school, then either detention isn't punishment, or extracurricular activites are punishment.

Therefore, I think students should not be required to take an extracurricular activity after school because teachers assign too much homework, it's not ""extra""-curricular if it's required, and students shouldn't be required to stay at school after dismissal.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
02322AA38631,"Dear Principle

I think that it is not right to require a B grade average to participate in sports.

Not all of the kids are capable of getting a B grade average. Most of the reasons why is mainly because of people struggling in their classes. If this were to go into affect, less people would try out for these sports teams. The only positive thing i see in this idea is that it will make students try harder to get better grades in their classes to have activity status to participate in these activities.

Lots of people struggle to get a B or even a C average. In my opinion, I don't think grades should be a requirement to do extra activities. Personally i can get a B average but making that extra pus for it can be quite stressful at times. As i said previously, this is mostly a negative thing to do for the most part.

588CDD2F40C4,"Wouldn't it be great to be able to drive to places without anyone actually driving? I think that would be fantastic! Today, I am going to talk about driverless cars. I think that driverless cars should continue to be developed because, they would make the world a more productive place, the cars are still in development and they would be cheaper in the long run.

First, I will talk about how they would make the world a more productive place. While we are driving we spend so much time paying attention to the road, but what if didn't have to? We would have that time to do other things, like maybe work on a new great project that could change the world. With driverless cars, taxi drivers wouldn't have a job. That means that they would have to find something else to do. They could become doctors and bring us back to health; They could become officers and protect us from the dangers in the world.

Next, I will talk about how they are still in development. I think that a lot of people are judging driverless cars by the way they are working now. We shouldn't give up on them so soon; Scientific discoveries happen all the time. Someone will find something that completely changes driverless cars for the better. Besides, they already show so much promise. In test drives, these cars could survive more than half a million miles without a crash. Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have driverless cars by 2020. Let's wait until then to judge driverless cars.

Lastly, I will talk about how they are cheaper. The driverless cars that Google cofounder Sergey Brin foresees would use half the fuel we use today. Fossil fuels are becoming an issue, but what if we had one less use for them? Without the need for so much fuel that wouldn't be so much of an issue anymore, and we would have more time to plan for whenever the time may be that we run out of fossil fuels. Also, if we perfected the driverless car there will be a lot less crashes. Without so many crashes we wouldn't be paying for repairs as often. We also wouldn't pay for the medical bills and such associated with an automobile accident.

In conclusion, I think that we should keep working on driverless cars. We should keep developing them because, they would increase the world's productivity, they are cheaper in the long run and because they deserve a chance. It would be great to be able to drive somewhere without anyone actually driving.",0,persuade_corpus,,9

This is a program that benefits a lot of children around the world that for different circumstances they can't attend to a school building. But what happens when a child has the physical and mental capacity to attend school but still decides to have home school, are they going to have the same benefits as the rest of students that attend to school?

Every child has the right to be educated. There exists plenty of qualities and values that a student can develop in a classroom such as: honesty, friendship, respect, leadership, etc. These are just some of all the attributes a student can gain by attending to school, but one of the most important qualities that a human can learn is the interaction with others. This is because the world is based on that, every single day people interact with other people and learn form each other, this is the way the world works.

In school, students have to interact with their classmates and teachers day by day. There are group assignments were teachers put you in a group were nobody knows each other so they can work together and hopefully build a good friendship. Sports in school are also a great way to interact with others, teachers encourage students to participate in sport activities after school. If the student doesn't like sports there also are different clubs in school in which students can participate.

I think this¬†act has an advantage and disadvantage¬†because, it help students understand what they are learning, it waste¬†time and it expensive to afford, students do a lot of research.

First, distance learning from home or by online or video conferencing help student to undrestand what they are learning. When student learn online or video conferencing, it helps the student get more knowledge about what they are learning and ask questions about what they dont understand. Example people normally feel shy especially teenagers to talk or ask question in public. This online or video conference will help the student to able to ask questions and understand what he or she is learning.

Again, distance learning from home or online or video conference waste¬†time and it expensive to afford .A lot of students have jobs so they are unable to take class, such student will have to engage in distance learning through online or video conferencing to improve his or her grade. Example some¬†students take care of themselves, so he or she has to work and pay the bills. However, video conference and online waste¬†money¬†because some of the students do not drive. They have to take Uber from home to class,which is expensive but the video conferencing and online is easy to afford.

Lastly,distance learning through online or video conferencing helps students to do a lot of research.

Example when the students are learning,they may come across a word or phrase or sentence¬†that¬†they may¬†not be familiar with it. This gives them the opportunity to do a lot of research about it.

If students were to take distance learning they could literally get their education from their bed.

Also, distance learning being an option will be very useful to the many people that dont get along with society. Students wouldnt need to feel any type of discomfort being around any other people like they would in a school building. Therefore, students wouldnt be in any drama or in any type of negative conflicts with anyone else. If distant learning was available it would help those who are anti social by not putting them with other people students and would receive their education one on one without having anything interfere which will help the students keep their focus towards their education.

In conclusion, distant learning is overall the best method toward getting your education, because you can get your education at home comfortably¬†with no distractions. It will help decrease negative drama and fights because there will be no misunderstandings between students since there wont be groups of students. Therefore, every student will get their education at their own pace without any need to rush or panic. After all being comfortable while getting your education is the best way to go so thats why distance learning should be available so everyone gets a chance to get their education their way.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Another reason I want you to join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" is because we transport food supplies,animals, and more. During the crossing I had to cre for the animals. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had be cleaned.

6CBF5570EF1D,"A ""car free"" community has many advantages. They will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases. They will also help you save more money by not having to pay for a car, and if you do, you can park it in a garage for $40,000. This will also expand other transportation and will have a new six-year federal transportation bill. There is no disadvantages for having a ""car-free"" community. Many countries and cities are participating in limiting car usage to make the air better and cleaner.

First, and most important, is that reducing cars also reduces the greenhouse gas emmision. People that participate in this are most likely doing it to make the air we breath better. In some over-populated cities, the amount of smog is crazy. After just one day without some cars, the amount of smog dissapeared. London had the idea for even-numbered license plates to be banned to drive one day, even though some people still used their cars. So more than half the cars are still on the road, and it reduced smog so much, they didn't even need to ban the odd numbered cars. This is the most important reason why people are limiting car usage.

Next, if you live in a car free community, you will never have to pay for your car. You can sell it to make more money becuase you will never have to use it. This is much better than owning a car and having to park it in a garage for $40,000. If you ever need to take the bus, you will have the money. With the extra money you can buy a bike also. The stores will be walking distances, so there is no need for a car. I think this is a great idea for not only a better community, but it would help people socialize with neighbors and it saves money while doing it. After World War II, the cities would start reconstructing around the car, but now that is beggining to change in Vauban, Germany.

Last, the cities are trying to expand public transportation, such as taxis and buses. It would promote these and play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have gone to highways by law and 20 percent have gone to other transportation. If the city bans cars, you can either walk, skate, bike, or ride the bus or taxi. In America, the amount of cars being bought and license plates being bought are decreasing since 1995. President Obama has an ambitious goal on which he unvieled last week and he wants to get rid of green house gas emmisions.

In conclusion, I think you would agree that limiting car usage has its advantages. It reduces greenhouse gases and also smog. After one day, Paris was clear of gas and smog in the air. The gas gets caught under the atmosphere and is dangerous. Limiting car usage also will help you save money because you no longer will have a car to pay for. Also, it would boost other forms of transportation, such as buses and taxis. This is a great idea to limit cars.    ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
01DF3961CF90,"Dear, principal i completely disagree with your actions of changing the policy that kids must have a B average to compete in sports i think u should change the policy back to c average and i have 3 reasons to show you why u should.

First, Not all kids can make the B average standard cause they may be going through problems with their family, maybe they have a short attention span and can't help t that they get off task or maybe they are just unorganized and lose their homework all the time.

Second, To some kids sports is their life and that's all they got and they much rather be playing sports then on the street corner selling drugs, gang banging, getting into trouble, or maybe they jus don't wannabe sitting at home being lazy. Sometimes kids just need to get away from home or just want to try new things so they play sports

Third, To some kids sports are their future and they cant make the grade average so that keeps them from playing sports and achieving their future dream as an famous athlete. An making it into college so that they can leave their home town and explore the world or just stay their and experience new things.

Conclusion, those are my opinions why i think you should change the grade average back to a C.",0,persuade_corpus,,8

llama_70b_v1291,"I think that students would greatly benefit from the option to attend classes from home through distance learning. There are many reasons why this would be a positive option for students.

Firstly, distance learning would allow students to learn in a comfortable and familiar environment. For some students, attending school can be a stressful experience, especially for those who struggle with social anxiety or bullying. By being able to attend classes from home, students would be able to learn in a setting that they feel safe and comfortable in, which would help them to focus and retain information better.

Secondly, distance learning would provide students with more flexibility in their schedules. Many students have extracurricular activities or work part-time jobs, which can make it difficult to balance school and other responsibilities. With distance learning, students would be able to attend classes at a time that suits them best, which would help them to manage their time more effectively.

Thirdly, distance learning would allow students to learn at their own pace. Every student learns differently and at their own speed. With distance learning, students would be able to pause, rewind, and rewatch lectures as many times as they need to, which would help them to better understand the material.

Lastly, distance learning would provide students with access to a wider range of courses and resources. Some schools may not offer certain courses or electives, but with distance learning, students would be able to access courses from other schools or institutions, which would provide them with a broader range of learning opportunities.

However, it is important to note that distance learning would not be suitable for all students. Some students may struggle with self-motivation and discipline, which could make it difficult for them to keep up with coursework and assignments. Additionally, some students may not have access to the necessary technology or internet connection to participate in distance learning, which could create unequal opportunities for students.

In conclusion, I believe that distance learning would be a beneficial option for students. It would provide them with a comfortable and familiar learning environment, flexibility in their schedules, the ability to learn at their own pace, and access to a wider range of courses and resources. However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and ensure that all students have equal access to this opportunity.",1,llama_70b_v1,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

5D021E279D42,"Dear Principal,

As an Eighth Grade student I feel that sports should be allowed to all students. Knowing that the students usually get C' s, you should let them be included in sports. I think that kid's should get at least a B in classes, but saying they cannot participate in sports makes them feel left out. Some kids are better at academics than sports and others are better at athletics. By having students involved in sports, I think it will have them feel better about themselves. If they feel better about themselves, they can possibly get better grades. I feel an adjustment to the rule can be students can start with a C average but if they can't bring up their grade by the third week of sports, they should be kicked off of the team.

Students should also be allowed to participate in other activities such as Student Government, Writing Club, and Drama. Again, some students are amazing in these fields and they won't be able to prove that if they have lower than a B. I personally know many talented people who don't do a good job in school, but excel at music, writing, and art. I am not disagreeing with you that a good education is not important, but sports and activities can help kids get more out of school.

I also feel that these sports and activities can be an escape for some people. Some play football to let go of their anger and others write to express themselves. Personally, I play sports to relax and write music in a way to let all my feelings out on paper. I am not alone in doing this. By telling students they need at least a B average, you are not letting them show what they are fully capable of.

I am asking you to please take this letter into consideration. You may agree or disagree with this letter but this is coming from the eyes of a student that cares about their peers. Thank you for reading this letter.

764BF089CE9C,"Summer assignment is a term most students would be appalled to hear about. For some, however, the concept of summer projects helps to ensure that students are continuing to learn and develop their education over the break. Due to the conditions summer work is assigned under, it poses the question of who should be designing the assignments, teachers or students? While teachers may have a broader understanding of the subject matter that their students will need to know and work on over summer, it is the students who should be assigning summer projects as they better understand which subjects they struggle in, know their own work schedule, and are able to make projects which appeal to their own interests.

First and foremost, students have a much better understanding of topics which they struggle on than their teachers do. Since teachers do not always understand the problems a student might be facing in class, it may lead the teacher to assign work which ends up becoming meaningless to the student and a waste of time for both student and teacher. Work assigned by students, on the other hand, may be much more personalized towards problems which students face inside their classes. This personalization of summer work for students ensures that while they learn new topics, they are still able to reinforce and improve in topics which might have caused many issues in the past.

The work schedule of a student is incredibly difficult to track. As such, if teachers were giving summer assignments, they might not be able to account for the massive diversity in the work schedules of students. Student designed summer projects would be much more effective as a learning tool, as students would have better judgment of how quickly any given student could complete their work, thus enabling students over the summer to learn at their own pace. By enabling students to learn at their own pace, they would not feel as rushed as they normally would when completing work for school, which in turn would result in students completing much higher quality work and getting more out of the learning experience.

Since all students are different, most students will not have the exact same interests. Under a design made by teachers, summer projects might end up dull or uninteresting towards many students as a whole, whereas student designed projects can appeal more to the interests of most, leading to more academic success overall. Under a student designed summer project, students can feel more involved in their assignments, and as such, will be more likely to choose things which interest them. By having students design summer assignments, they can select subjects which maintain their interest in education and provide for the improvement of previous lessons.

Teachers are not omnipotent. If they were, students would be able to find much more joy in an education experience much more personalized to their interests. Instead, throughout the school year, students are forced through a multitude of tasks which may not be up to par with their expectations. This issue, however, does not need to exist during summer projects as well. Under a student designed summer project, students can find much more interest in content which they otherwise might never learn, improve on subject areas concerning to them, and provide an adaptable schedule which matches their own work schedule, thus¬†providing a better educational summer experience for everyone.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
04F277F6562D,"Was the Face on Mars really created by Aliens? Or was it just a very unusual rock formation, even for Mars? Well, the answer is no, it was just a natural landform. This giant rock formation, which stretches for about two miles from end to end, isn't uncommon at all. Actually, it is a mesa which just has shadows that cast on it a certain way, which makes it look exactly like a face.

I know what you might be thinking. How could it only be a natural landform? It looks exactly like a face, so it must have been created by something or someone. Well, there are actually plenty of reasons why it is just a normal landform with unusual shadows. For example, the Face was found in an area of Mars called Cydonia. Cydonia is actually known for its common Martian Mesas. This means that it isn't too shocking that it is natural.

Don't get me wrong, a face is a pretty rare and unusual thing for a mesa to look like. Even though this one has strange shadows that give it features of a face, it is still just a mesa. After multiple pictures that were taken of the Face, the one taken on April 5, 1998 was the first one to fully reveal that the Face was indeed just a natural landform. Even though the picture clearly showed that the Face wasn't a man-made structure, some people still weren't convinced. They said that the picture was taken on a cloudy winter day, so many skeptics thought that maybe there were alien markings that were just hidden by haze.

No matter what people believed after they saw the picture taken in 1998, the picture taken on April 8, 2001 was the one that proved to the skeptics that the Face was a naturally occurring landform. Since the picture was taken on a cloudless day the next time around, there were no excuses for those who thought the Face was made by aliens. This picture actually showed that the Face was a martian, and it was about the same size as a butte or a mesa. Buttes and mesas are landforms that are commonly found in the western regions of the United States.

There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

llama_70b_v1654,"Introduction:
Studying Venus seems like a dangerous idea, but is it worth it? In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author argues that it is. They say that even though it's hard and dangerous, we can learn important things from Venus that will help us understand Earth and even other planets. But does the author do a good job of showing that it's worth it? In this essay, I'll say why I think they do.

Body:
The author tells us that Venus is like Earth in a lot of ways. It's similar in size and weight, and it's got a thick atmosphere too. But that's where the similarities end. Venus is way hotter than Earth, and the air is full of dangerous gases. The author says that studying Venus can help us learn about Earth's climate and how it could change in the future. They also say that Venus is a good place to test technology for future missions to other planets. This means that what we learn on Venus might help us on other planets too.

The author also tells us that some missions to Venus have already been successful. They mention the Magellan spacecraft, which mapped Venus' surface in the early 1990s. This mission helped us learn more about Venus' geology and gave us some really cool pictures. But even though there have been successes, the author also tells us about the dangers of exploring Venus. They say that the atmosphere is so thick and hot that it destroys most spacecraft that try to land. This means that we have to be really careful and smart if we want to send people to Venus.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the author does a good job of showing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They give us good reasons for why it's important to explore Venus, like learning about Earth's climate and testing technology for other planets. They also show us that it's not impossible to explore Venus, even though it's hard. I think that the author makes a strong argument, and I agree that studying Venus is worth it.",1,llama_70b_v1,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

F0BF917BB673,"While NASA's greatest scientists were working hard in their Jet Propulsion Lab in 1976, an eerie picture appeared on their monitors, as the spacecraft they sent to Mars, the Viking 1, has taken a picture of what looks like an alien-built human face on Mars, though it was actually another basic landform on the red planet. The reason Viking I was taking pictures of Mars was to scope out possible landing sites for its sister ship, the Viking 2. The scientists did realize that this ""face"" was just another common Martian landform, so when they put the picture up, its caption stated that it was only a rock formation resembling a human head. In order to fully prove to everyone that the Face on Mars was just a landform, they even sent the MGS, or Mars Global Surveyor, to retake pictures of the area presumed to be the face. They even sent it back for another round of retakes thanks to peoples' suspicions of cloudy weather blocking the view of the face! Thanks to many tests and retakes, scientists have proven that the Face on Mars is just another landform.

While Viking 1 was taking pictures on Mars to find a landing site for Viking 2, it snapped a picture of what appeared to be a gigantic face staring at them like a man staring at the stars with binoculars. Although scientists were very surprised when the face appeared on the monitors in their lab, their sensation lasted only a short time. They figured it was only another common Martian mesa with shadows that only resembled a human face. So that they could get enough hey-everyone-check-this-out popularity for the red planet, they made the image of the Face on Mars public, and the NASA scientists gave it the caption noting that it was ""a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Thanks to this new caption, public attention for Mars, but it ended up dominating people's view on Mars, making them create conspiracy theories rather than convince the truth that it was only another landform on Mars. Despite the people making the Face on Mars a well-known pop icon, it always was and always will be another Martian landform.

In order to prove to the people that the Face on Mars was an ordinary-as-white-paint landform, they sent a new probe, the Martian Global Surveyor, or MGS, to Mars in 1998 to try to retake pictures of the face. The MGS succeeded at its task, as it swayed public opinion away from the idea that the face had to do with alien life existing on Mars at that time. Thousands of looking-forward-to-this web explorers were waiting for the picture to become public, they were also disappointed by the fact that it was a natural landform rather than an exotic alien monument. However, not everyone was satisfied with these results, as they wanted more proof that the face was a face and not a landform thanks to cloudy weather. The MGS did succeed in proving that the Face on Mars was not a face, though more attempts were required to get the idea to everyone.

Not everyone was content with the results of the MGS expedition, wanting to believe that the cloudy weather at the time the picture was taken to be responsible for the lack of the face's visibility. Despite how NASA's chief scientist for their Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, stated that ""it's not easy to target Cydonia,"" the people wanted more retakes. NASA was able to get the MGS to get better shots of the face in April 2001, and they were able to capture a wonderful photo with the camera's maximum resolution, which dominated the Viking 1's resolution by being nearly thiry times better. Thanks to Garvin's reasoning and the high-as-the-sky resolution of the MSG's new pictures, they were able to prove that the face was only the equivalent of a butte or mesa, both of which were common landforms. Thanks to the MSG's multiple trips, they captured enough well-detalied pictures to prove the true identity of the Face of Mars.

The Face of Mars is only an ordinary landform, and it always will be just another ordinary landform. The scientists began with a caption to the original photo stating that it was a landform only resembling a face, then they sent the Mars Global Surveyor out to try to prove that the Face on Mars was a landform. They also later sent the MGS out again during not-cloudy-at-all weather to let everyone know for sure that the face was not a face. All of these efforts combined let people know how the Face on Mars was not a face but only a landform, but there are likely still people out there who belive that the Face on Mars is still some type of alien relic. Despite how popular the conspiracy theories about the Face of Mars being an alien monument, it was only a standard landform the whole time.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
9562D07129D8,"THere has been quite a lot of recent talk of which the national government should keep the Electoral COllege, or change to an election by popular vote for the president of the UNited states. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress""(Source 1: What is the Electoral College? by the office of the federal register). IT has been established by the founding fathers to make a compromise between popular vote and election vote in congress. Popular representation is a vote for qualified citizens to take an individual vote cast to the state which then is transfered to a representative whole. Thre are many good effects this popular representation has on the country, but the Denator should keep the Electoral College without a shout of a doubt.

one of the most important reasons we should keep the electoral college process is that in this process, states pay much more attention to the electors due to having swing states. the people who decide on our president should be most intrigued and the most concerning ones. ""Voteres in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign - to really listen to the competeing candidates- knwing htat theu are going to decide the election(in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president, by richard a. posner, subtitle Swing States)"".¬† MAny voters that are in swing states, which are stated that cast the majority of votes in the system with higher amounts of population, therefore congress representatives.

another reason why the gov shouyld keep the elctoral college is because¬† it resorts unwanted balance.¬† ""there is no pressure for run-off elections when no candidtate wins a mojority of the votes casy; that pressuire mwhich would greatly cvomplicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner"" so what this quote from the passage is saying is that no candidate recieves a majority if the votes cast, due to each states fair rep of the population without being overwhlemded by the most populated states such as florida, california, and trexas. While you may believe that the popular representaion vote may be overwhelmingkly more accurate to the people wants , you are wrong. the electoral college is a processs in whic hgives the people wants in a state to an elector who then gives yiou an equal chance onf voting for what youo pleased. he may be the ""biggest"" or ""smallest"" amount of electoral votes, but as a state in a whole yu may recieve a big surprise that there is no clear winner as each [president may not be just familiat with one region such as the north east, or the southwest, etc.

I understand that extracurricular activities are important for students' development, but I believe it should be up to the students to decide if they want to participate or not.

Firstly, students have different interests and talents. Forcing them to participate in an activity they are not interested in will only lead to a lack of motivation and enthusiasm. They may also feel pressure to excel in an activity they don't enjoy, which can lead to stress and anxiety.

Secondly, some students have busy schedules outside of school. They may have part-time jobs or family obligations that prevent them from participating in extracurricular activities. Forcing them to participate may only add to their workload and stress.

Lastly, students may have other priorities in their lives, such as focusing on their academics or pursuing their own hobbies and interests. Forcing them to participate in extracurricular activities may take away from their ability to focus on these priorities.

In conclusion, while extracurricular activities can be beneficial for students, it should be up to the students to decide if they want to participate or not. Forcing students to participate may only lead to a lack of motivation, stress, and a decreased ability to focus on their priorities.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

2F63222FA0FA,"While it has been proven that school is statistically one of the safest environments for students to be, those who attend school may not all say the same. Several students are victim to peer pressure each day, often feeling forced into making rash decisions that could land them in academic, mental, or physical trouble; the circumstance for this varies with each student. Some may feel more comfortable in the classrooms, where they are away from the unsupervised children in the halls, or some may feel safer away from the classroom, where peers could indirectly apply unwanted or unnecessary pressure to another student. The range of these social pressures could be anything; from being forced to work in a group of students that constantly clash, to being forced into trying out drugs behind school bleachers. In some instances, students don't feel pressured by their peers at all; teachers, schoolwork, homework, or even the building itself are all other factors that can cause unwanted pressure or stress. If students were able to work from home, they would be free to develop their own schedule for getting their work done, and would be able to do so without the constant anxiety from outside forces.

Making the shift from going to school to taking classes at home would not be difficult, as online classes are no foreign affair. Already, students have been given the oppurtunity to take classes from home to help even out their schedule, to catch up with lost time, or to get a jumpstart on what they would need to do next year. If students were able to take all of their classes online, they wouldn't need to worry about catching up. Students would be free to work on assignments throughout the week on their own time, developing their own work schedule as to how they want to get things done. This would help eleviate some of the stress regarding how much work they would need to complete ""outside of class.""

Students would also be free to work without the push of peer pressure. Not only would they be able to work in an environment that is without social distraction, they would be able to do so in an environment that is calming and familiar. There are many children and teens across the world that suffer from some form of social anxiety, and are constantly afraid of what might happen when they enter the school premises. Many students who have to deal with this anxiety are still forced to do projects that involve speaking in front of the class or working with students they are not familiar with. If students were able to work from their homes, they would not have to receive their education while in a state of constant fear. They would be more focused on the work provided for them rather than the social distractions of mistreatment, bullying, and peer pressure. This means that students may actually feel more confident in their abilities to complete assignments on their own since they will no longer be faced with potential criticism from their peers.

Not only do online classes require less from the students socially, but financially as well. Since most of the work done in online classes is saved to a hard drive or a student email account, there would be no need to buy copious amounts of school supplies. In fact, most of their ""supplies"" would be neatly compiled for them all in one place: their school assigned laptop. Students would be able to work without lugging around five different binders and an agenda to get through the school day. Of course, there could be special instances where students may need some extra supplies beyond just their laptop--but even these requirements would be drastically smaller than the typical checklist of a public school student.

There are instances in which students feel that working at home would not be beneficial. Some students use school as their means to interact with friends they otherwise can't see outside of the school week. Other feel that working at home would provide its own personal distractions, such as family pets roaming the house, younger siblings who have yet to go to school, or even parents who also work from home. The indirect communication with teachers from an online class may provide unforeseen complicaitons with the student's ability to deeply grasp whatever concept he or she is trying to learn.

To some, these cons of working from home outweigh the pros. Of course, there will never be one true way of education that is perfect for everyone. Each student has his or her own personal needs and preferences; situations that they will work better or worse in; classes that they better grasp than others. Working from home may provide its own new distractions, but much like the issues regarding public school, these kinks can be addressed and overcome. Students who find their pets or siblings to be distracting can find a quiet, empty space within their house that they can choose to make their ""work space"" for the day. Those who find that they are having trouble understanding a concept can continue to discuss it more with their teacher once their class has ended, or even schedule private classes with the teacher outside of the ""class period"" to receive more direct one-on-one assistance. Students could even use their school emails as a means to communcating with their friends and use this as a tool to schedule out-of-school hangouts they otherwise couldn't schedule before.

With online classes, students would be free to manage their schedule entirely themselves. By working from home, students would have the oppurtunity to receive a more managed, independent, and focused education.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,4
ACF8D85BE4F4,"Imagine how things would seem to a school attending student when the average grade skyrockets as a result of the distanced students cheating at home. For students nowadays, assignments that are to be done at home may as well be free points due to the prevalence of cheating. The home environment and school assignments do not mix. Although some might believe otherwise, social development, keeping students engaged, and cheating prove that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Social interactions are instrumental in the development of young people and help create productive members of society. Most, if not all, of these interactions between young students occur in the school environment. This connection between consistent social interactions and strong social abilities shows the importance of having an in-person education. While some might say that school is not required for the development of young adults into socially able adults, it is the most common form of consistent social exposure for young people.

It is apparent that the environment that school provides is important in maintaining students' attentiveness and reception to education. Students are more likely to preform well in the school environment than the one at home due to excess distractions. It is for that reason that students should not be given the option to receive and education in an environment outside of school. Some may claim that it is possible to create a viable learning environment at home, but it is unlikely that many would follow the strict lifestyle needed for the disciplined environment required for meaningful education.

The introduction of modern technology into education brought with it the prevalence of cheating. Students nowadays can already find online the answers to almost any assignment they receive, so giving them their entire education at home, where no limit on cheating exists, would certainly decrease the legitimacy of their work. Some may claim the opposite, saying that it is important to rely on the integrity of students to give them a sense of trust and independence. This is based in fallacy, however, because those principles are developed through structured education, which cannot be found in stay-at-home schooling.

It is important for students to stay in education because of the social, educational, and honesty benefits that come from school. In the future, students should maintain their public schooling system due to the aforementioned benefits. In the past, education in school has proven to be effective in developing adequate social and learning skills in students. A call to action on the issue of online classes versus in-school classes could be the introduction of legislature that requires students to attend school in person rather than online.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

CD52F56B2392,"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that the school board should not add more time to the school hours. While it may seem like a good idea to give students more time to learn, there are several reasons why this would not be beneficial.

Firstly, adding more time to the school day would mean that students would have less time to complete their homework. Many students already struggle to keep up with their workload, and giving them even more time would only make things worse. This would put a lot of pressure on students to complete their assignments, which could lead to stress and burnout.

Secondly, many students have plans after school that they look forward to. Whether it's going to a sporting event, meeting with friends, or pursuing a hobby, these activities are an important part of a student's life. Adding more time to the school day would mean that students would have less time to do these things, which could lead to feelings of frustration and disappointment.

Thirdly, some students may have to go somewhere after school, such as to a part-time job or to take care of their siblings. Adding more time to the school day would mean that these students would have to find a way to fit in their after-school responsibilities, which could be difficult and stressful.

Finally, some students may find themselves feeling bored in class. While it's important to keep students engaged in their studies, adding more time to the school day would not necessarily solve this problem. If students are feeling bored, it's likely because the curriculum is not challenging or interesting to them. Adding more time to the school day would not make the curriculum any better, and could even make things worse by causing students to feel more disengaged.

In conclusion, while the idea of adding more time to the school day may seem like a good one, there are several reasons why this would not be beneficial. Students already struggle to keep up with their workload, and adding more time would only make things worse. Students have plans and responsibilities outside of school that they look forward to, and adding more time to the school day would mean that they would have less time to enjoy these things.

5E9444EE8F6F,"Dear Principle,

The two policies you are having to choose from are very negotiable. Having no cell phones at all at school probably would not go over very well. I think that will not stop students from bringing them, and will just influence them to using them in secrecy. This policy will bring more on you, by having to punish the kids that are bringing them to school anyway. Most students break this rule as it is. There is no harm in having cellular devices on school property, unless there is misuse of them, or they are distracting the class from learning.

My opinion is that we should be allowed to bring our cell phones to school, and use them during free time, lunch, or passing periods. During these times we are not supervised by s teacher, or are distracting anyone from the school regulations. Plus, it would be very helpful if you have an emergency, or need to get a-hold of someone for a ride or anything worth needing contact. You could have a rule that if your phone is not turned off during class, than you may serve a detention and get your phone taken away for the rest of school.

I see my teachers on their phone constantly. They occasionally have it turned off during class, but every once and a while it will disrupt our class. If it is their job to be here and they have their phones on, then why cant we? Teachers nor students should have their phones during class, or while learning. You must keep the rules mutual.

Phones are a minor speed bump during our school day. We should not let it become a big deal, and just keep the use at a minimum. I believe you should make the rules that you may only turn your cell phones on during passing periods, lunch, or free time. Any down time of your day is acceptable. Other than that there will be consequences. This new policy will sound fair to everyone and will keep the commotion down. Students will respect that you let them use it then, let alone at all. They will most likely follow the rules. This is the best way you should go to have a fair school day. Keep your options in mind.

A1A24A4F922E,"""The Face on Mars""

On May 24 2001, a NASA spacecraft discovered a shadow in the shape of a human face. Some scientist believed that the face was caused by aliens, but many others believed that it was just a natural landform. Mesa's and butte's are two types of natural landforms. They are very common around Cydonia.

Around May, NASA put the image on the interenet for everyone to view. The caption of the picture said it was a huge rock with the ILLUSION of a face. An illusion is a when someone plays a trick on your eyes,this means it could look like a face but be an mesa. The way a person sees something is based on their own perspective. If one scientist sees a alien shape,another person sees a human face,and the other see a rock it is based on their point of view.

The picture caught alot of attention even by the chief scientist of NASA""s Mars Exploration Program,Jim Gavin. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team came to take pictures of Mars. The used a camera that had better quality than the Viking spacecraft. MOC's picture proved that the Face was only a natural landform. There were people who still thought it was analien so they took another picture. They used a camera that would make the image 3 times its pixel size, this means that if their was anything or size you would see is.

In the end,pictures proved that the Face shaped like a human's turned out to be just a butte or a mesa which was common. Many people are disappointed, but scientist have proven thier theory of ancient civilization on the Red Planet is incorrect. The Face still remains on the planet Mars. There are still many parts of the world that are yet to be discovered. Who knows what is out there?",0,persuade_corpus,,6

falcon_180b_v1_594,"Homework is a subject that has been debated for years by educators, students, and parents alike. While some people believe it is an essential part of the learning process, others argue that it can put unnecessary stress on students. In my opinion, homework can be both beneficial and stressful depending on how it is given and managed.

To start with, homework helps students reinforce what they have learned in class, and it allows them to practice their skills outside of the classroom. Homework can also help students develop good study habits and time management skills, which are essential for success in high school and beyond. For instance, if a student has a project due next week, completing it over a few days will help them manage their time better and avoid cramming everything in at the last minute.

Additionally, homework can help students identify areas where they need more help or practice. If a student has difficulty with a specific problem or concept, they can bring it to the teacher's attention during the next class, and the teacher can provide additional support to help the student succeed. Homework also allows students to work at their own pace, which is beneficial for those who may not understand a topic the first time it is taught in class.

However, excessive homework can put unnecessary stress on students, causing them to feel overwhelmed and burnt out. It is essential for teachers to assign homework that is relevant and meaningful, rather than just busy work. For example, a student may have three different assignments due in the same week, which will cause stress and prevent them from fully engaging in any of them.

In conclusion, I believe homework can be an effective tool to help students reinforce what they have learned in class, develop good study habits, and identify areas where they need more support. However, it is essential for teachers to manage homework carefully to ensure that it is relevant, meaningful, and does not cause unnecessary stress on students. Ultimately, homework should be used as a tool to help students succeed, not as a source of stress and anxiety.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Some people argue that homework is an essential part of learning, while others believe it puts unnecessary stress on students.

Researching the benefits of a four day school week and a seven day school week, I found some pretty interesting stuff. At first, I thought a four day week would be way better, but then I realized why a seven day week might be more beneficial. ü§î

So, let's start with the pros of a four day week. Firstly, it means less time away from school, which means more time for extracurricular activities and hobbies. Plus, it's better for the environment since we're not using as much energy and resources. And, let's be real, who doesn't love an extra day off to binge-watch Netflix? üì∫

But, there are also some cons to a four day week. For one, it can be harder to fit in all the necessary learning material in just four days. Plus, some teachers might have a harder time preparing lessons and grading assignments with a shorter week. And, let's not forget about the weekends ‚Äì if we have school on Fridays, it can be harder to have fun and relax since we're already thinking about school the next day. üò©

Now, let's switch to the seven day week. At first, it might seem like a nightmare ‚Äì more school, more homework, more everything! üò© But, hear me out. A seven day week means more time for learning and exploring new things. We could have longer classes, more project time, and even more extracurricular activities. Plus, it's better for our brains since we're not cramming all our learning into just five days. It's like, our brains need a little extra time to absorb everything and really learn it. üß†

And, let's not forget about the teachers! A seven day week means they have more time to plan lessons, grade assignments, and collaborate with each other. It's like, they get a little extra time to be teachers and not just educators. ü§ì

It would also give teachers a break from lesson planning and let them relax a bit more over the summer. It would even help the students actually learn better since it's self-paced over three months of time. Let the students design their summer project.

Students should be able to focus on a topic that interests them. They spend 180 seven-hour days in school, over half of which are spent on things that the student will never use nor care about in their life. In fact, I would say that, based on my experience in an average year of high school, that only about thirty-one out of the 180 days are actually interesting due to content of learning. If the student cares about the work they are doing, then they will do a better job and have a higher quality finished product. Plus, they will not end up turning in thirty-five of the exact same project.

If students get to design their summer project, it would take some of the stress away from the teachers. Based on the amount of homework I have received from some of my classes this year, teachers are given too much content to teach in 180 days, especially with so many variables of events. Things such as snow days and sicknesses cause a light panic for the teachers, and the resulting work annoys the¬†student body. It would really make things a lot easier for students to design their own individual projects than be assigned a mass-produced rubric and checklist on the last day of school.

Students get a large amount of information in the course of a single day, ranging from how to calculate compound interest to learning how WWI changed warfare as we knew it. I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that all of that information is forgotten about by the next morning, and the information gets lost. If summer break is three months long, imagine how easily the information will be forgotten if they have to do a structured, formulaic, factory-style requirements list that is three months of ordinary school content. They would learn nothing from it, and waste three months. If they get to design their own project, however, they get to set their own deadlines and set up the requirements so they actually do learn something, which is the whole purpose of the project.

Personally, I would like to say that a summer project of any kind is a bad idea. If the law of the land decrees that a summer project should be assigned to the students, let the students design their own projects. It will help them actually learn about their interests, in their own way. Teachers will be able to worry about one less thing. I got to design my own project once, and ended up making a movie about genetics and the brain's abilities, and it was probably my favorite project ever, because I got to learn about something that I waned to learn about and present it in a way that I enjoyed. There is no better feeling than getting to demonstrate your abilities and strengths for something you care about. Believe me, I have looked, but nothing comes close.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

If you use the Facial Action Coding System it could tell you how they are feeling in the painting and if they are happy or not. You can easliy tell if a person right infront of you is not happy but sometimes you cant. You can use the Facial System on them and it can tell you how they are feeling. Computers can also help out a lot on what you dont understand.

For instance in the Mona Lisa painting you cant tell her emotion in her picture. If you use technology it can help you out and tell you if she is happy or sad. It gives you a percentage like shes 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. It can give you an estimation on how she is feeling in the picture. The computer has an 3-D computer model so it has all of the face major muscles so it can tell your emotion on your face. It can show your surprised if your eyebrows are raised up or if your angry yuour lips would be tightened to show anger. You can also write down different emotions that you do in the mirror and see if someone can reconize what emotion you have. It can tell if you force a smile and if it wasn't a real one.

Having at least a extracurricular is a good idea to have when you are looking for something new at your school or club. Students who are engaged with the extracurricular are going to more focus on other topics. Extracurricular is a great way to keep students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends.

Having a extracurricular helps keep students active. Most students are on their phone all the time,so by having students participate in a extracurricular prevents them on their phone. I have done an extracurricular in my school, that has help forget about my phone and instead focus on more important on my softball team. Keeping students active on extracurricular helps them focus on the extracurricular they are doing. There so many different ways students can make themselves active for example sports and debate can encourage themselves to be active.

An extracurricular has different options to tryout. Trying out a extracurricular can be hard to choose. When you are trying out extracurricular you should find talents or skills that you are good at to find the perfect extracurricular. When I had to find a extracurricular I to choose activities that I am good at, or extracurricular that is joy able. Extracurricular is fun to explore out what kind of activities you are good and most joy able.

Socializing with your friends is fun when you can hang out with your friends in a extracurricular. Socializing with your friends can be extracurricular, for example like a girl or boy's club or a book club can be ways of an extracurricular. Another, way you can socialize with your friends is making new friends in extracurricular. You to meet other people that might want to be friends with. I have friends and made friends in a book club while talking about the book and relevant topics.

Having at least one extracurricular is a great to keep students active on the activity, finding different extracurricular's and socializing with your friends and making new ones. Keeping students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends are different ways of enjoying extracurricular and engaging students to themselves the activity that their are really interest into.

B727B720430B,"School Cellphone Policies: Policy 1 vs. Policy 2

As an eighth-grade student, I believe that Policy 1 is the better choice for students to avoid breaking the rules of their school. While Policy 2 may seem like a more lenient option, it can lead to distractions and cheating, which can ultimately harm students' academic performance.

Policy 1, which prohibits the use of cellphones during class time, is a strict but necessary policy. By not allowing students to use their phones during class, the school can ensure that students are fully engaged in the lesson and not distracted by social media, texting, or other activities on their phones. This policy also helps to prevent cheating, as students are not able to access information or communicate with others during exams or tests.

Policy 2, on the other hand, allows students to use their phones during class time as long as they are in ""silent mode."" While this policy may seem like a compromise, it can still lead to distractions and cheating. Students can easily switch their phones to ""speaker mode"" or use other apps that are not in ""silent mode,"" which can make it difficult for teachers to monitor their behavior. Additionally, students may be tempted to cheat by sharing information or collaborating with others during exams or tests.

One potential challenge that students may face with Policy 1 is the need to leave their phones at home or in their lockers during class time. This can be difficult for some students who rely on their phones for communication or emergency situations. However, it is important for students to understand the limitations of using their phones in the school and to plan accordingly. For example, students can use alternative methods of communication, such as email or texting after class, or they can bring a spare phone or charger to school.

In conclusion, I believe that Policy 1 is the better choice for students to avoid breaking the rules of their school. While Policy 2 may seem like a more lenient option, it can lead to distractions and cheating, which can ultimately harm students' academic performance. It is important for students to understand the limitations of using their phones or gadgets in the school and to plan accordingly.

This new technology will be very useful in a classroom full of students that one teacher may not be able to handle all on their own. The Facial Action Coding System will help deal with many problems by reading a students face. This may help deal with situations a teacher can not figure out on their own. This software may be able to tell the teacher when the student is confused, upset, or even when the student is bored and needs a more interactive subject or way of learning.

When a student is confused, they may not ask for help to a teacher. The child may be too shy or nervous to ask for a simple example or explanation. This software program will be helpful because it will be able to read the students confused face and tell a teacher that the student needs help. In the short story in paragraph six it states, ""most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This explains how not all people will use words to explain what they are feeling. These students may never speak up for themselves or have the courage to ask a question without the program being here to help deal with the childs needs.

The Facial Action Coding System will not only help with students life in the classroom, but it may also help with a students feelings deeper within. The software will be able to pick out the students who are very upset, and need to talk about their emotions to another person. If a student has a sad face in class, the program may be able to identify what is wrong with the child, and it could notify this information to a teacher or a well trusted adult. In paragraph five of this story it states, ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" By having this computer software, it could help out with a students mental emotional feelings as well.

This program will also be very helpful in providing a fun learning environment for the students. In the middle of paragraph six it explains how a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored. It also states that if you smile when a website advertisement pops up on the computer screen it will show more advertisements like that one. If a person frowns when this pops up, it willl show a different, more appealing advertisement. This can be very useful in a classroom. It may make the students more interested in learning. The students might even be more excited to learn now, because the computer will know that the students happy facial experssions mean they are enjoying the type of way the program is teaching them.

3509D3417A9D,"Phones and Driving

Driving is the most used form of transportation worldwide, it is everyone's personal transportation to go anywhere. Even though automobiles are used on the daily, car accidents occur every day in the U.S, there is about 3,287 deaths a day due to a car accident and yearly there are around 2 million people are in a car accidents. Humans are on their phones every day either talking on the phone, texting, or on social media. On average people use their phone for over 5 hours a day. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Phones should not be used while driving.

Driving is a big responsibility that some people don't necessarily take seriously, which is why people text and drive which has been the cause for a lot of accidents. On average the age people are texting and driving is between 18 and 34, which is also the age group where people get into a car accident. About 35% of teenagers get into an accident because they were using their phones while driving. Driving and texting is a bad combination and should be banned in all states just for safety reasons.

Although texting and driving is not the safest way of driving, it does have a positive effect when driving. For example, if you're in another state trying to figure out where you are going, then it is acceptable to use your phone for directions. Phone companies and care companies are making it safer to drive while on the phone because they added Bluetooth to the cars to make it easier to talk on the phone without having to grab their phone. Although these are positive attributes, the negative attributes dealing with texting and driving involve car accidents and sometimes even death. This could be avoided if phones usage while driving is banned.

Phone usage while driving is way too distracting, especially for those who already drive recklessly. There are allot of younger people who like to drive fast and recklessly because they want to feel that rush of speeding on the highway and passing an abundance of cars. What makes that situation much worst is, the younger new drivers will drive really fast and will be on their phone trying to text their friends or on social media. This is how car accidents are caused and how deaths occur with those accidents.

In conclusion, driving is a big responsibility and something people should take more serious, especially if they have passengers in the car. When you're driving with passengers, their safety and the driver's safety is very important. So their priority should be the people in the car and others on the road, not their phone and who texted them or who liked what on social media. Think about it like this, social media will always be there when you're here or not, so is getting on your phone while driving worth the risk of losing your life or taking someone else's life?

Why get rid of a system that has few flaws and gives people a since of picking their people? Electoral College should be kept because gives candiates a fair chance and lets everyone pick a representator.

To begin, electoral college gives candiates a fair chance. In source 3 it states "" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electroal votes to elect a president. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This expalins that even if only a candidate only represent one region of the country electoral college can still give them a chance to win presidency. In source 1 it states "" Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors."" This means electoral college gives a candidate a group of supporters to help him or her win a election.

Futhermore, electoral college gives the people a right to pick a representator. In source 1 it states "" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"". Everyone who is a United States citizen has the right to vote for who they want for representation for each state. In source 3 it states "" Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"". Thoughtful votes or people who just vote because everyone else is doing it doesnt matter. Everyone could vote for anyone with electoral college.

""Its official: The electroal college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguements against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college"". I disagree with this statement because the electoral college gives candiates a fair chance to win electons and the people get to pick who they want to represent their states.

The President basically just signs the papers that can pass a law but the Congress helps say if the law should pass or not.

People should be able also to choose who they want in Congress beacuse, people want a Congress that they know and trust to help our country turn into a better place. Sometimes the Congress only do what they want and feel is right. The Congress that the party choose may also be people that they like and believe will follow how they feel which may not be¬† how the citizen feel.

With the electoral college system voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. The problem with this is that when the electors go to vote for the presient, who are the electors? They could be anybody, so how would we know if our president that got choose had it fairly? Well, we dont. Instead of having the electoral college system we should change it to the popular vote of the people. By doing so, we can know that the president that got choose had it fair with all the other presidents that decided to run for the position to. Instead of when voting it being called a natural disaster which is what is known for as the electoral college we can know we voted fair by voting with the election by popular vote.

The people in the community should have the right in this because of the fact that , each and everyday we are going to have to live by the rules of the president, so we should have the right to vote for the president, and the outcome for whoever wins would be fair because thats who most the people think should run our country. At the basic level, the electoral college is unfair to the voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, only focusing on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It is officaial the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

53F1450AF8DF,"How many opinions do you need before you can make a decision? Well, I know that for me personally I ask many people their opinions about my situation and about what actions I should take before my final decision is made. That's just how most people are, they ask many people, they get many opinions, and then they decide which they think is best. However, most people probably don't know why they seek multiple opinions instead of just asking one person. So today I'm going to tell you why you shouldn't just ask one person's opinion because it's so much better to get multiple opinions from multiple different people. Asking many people for opinions can help you make better decisions because it allows you to see the situation from many different viewpoints, it helps you find out what the majority of people think, and it gives you the opportunity to deliberate what option is your best course of action based off many more than your own reasons.

First, it allows you to see your situation from perspectives that aren't your own. When you just ask one person for their opinion on your situation, they might agree with you. But, you know what happens when you just ask one person and they agree with you; you go with your ""gut feeling"" and if you do that then there was no point in asking for an opinion in the first place. However, if you ask multiple people for their opinions then you get many different perspectives, so you can see the situation through the eyes of the person you're fighting with, or running a business with, or having a baby with, etc. That way you can make the better choice because you can now see from the other person's view and understand why they are arguing against you.

I often have trouble making decisions about anything, I could be asked what I want for lunch and an hour later I still wouldn't have decided what I want for lunch. For example, I didn't used to eat breakfast at McDonalds, but one day I was hungry and I couldn't decide on what I wanted for breakfast, so I called a few people and asked for a few opinions about Sausage Mcgriddles. Some people said they were terrible, so terrible in fact they would be comparable to eating dirt; however, many more people said that Sausage Mcgriddles were delicious, they said that biting into a Sausage Mcgriddle was like biting into a world of pancake, syrup, and sausage heaven; they said it was a whole breakfast in one sandwich. So, now that I had seen from both viewpoints of the situation I made the choice of eating a Sausage Mcgriddle; and in my opinion it was the best choice I could've made.

Secondly, it helps you find out what the majority of people think. To most people that sounds like a bad thing; most people hear throughout their lives the words ""quality over quantity"". Often times, this is true, especially when it comes to consumer goods. But, if the statement ""quality over quantity"" was always true, why is it not used on everything? Well, when it comes to opinions quality is only determined by your opinion of the opinion. That's why presidential elections use quantity not quality because opinions don't have an official quality. The same is applied to any survey or poll that exists, they all are based on the numbers. So, if the president, the leader of the country, is elected by numbers, why shouldn't you have your own little election when you are faced with a difficult decision and you can't decide what choice is better?

Thirdly, if you ask multiple people for their opinions, you're going to get many reasons as to why they think that way. When people face difficult decisions and they a few choices they often try to come up with their own reasons as to why they should choose any one choice. Unfortunately, people, like myself, aren't the greatest at coming up with their own reasons. So, when you ask multiple people their opinions, you can base your choice on more than just your own, most likely self-centered, reasons. But, if you only ask one person then you're only going to get a few reasons that are based on one opinion and when you can't come up with reasons yourself a few reasons and one opinion isn't helpful.

At last, you've, hopefully, learned and realized why you shouldn't bother thinking about just asking one person for their opinion. You should ask multiple because with just one opinion you can't do anything. If you just ask one person you only get one opinion, and with one opinion you certainly can't find the majority because it's only one opinion. When you ask multiple people their opinions you can find the majority, if you don't want to go with the majority you can use the opinions to look at the situation from a different perspective, and if you don't want to do that just list all the reasons the people had behind their opinions and then decide, in your opinion, which reasons are good, logical reasons and what course of action do they support. Now, I ask you one question, how many opinions do you think you need before you can make a decision?",0,persuade_corpus,,4

And when someone tries to change their first impressions they always fail. First impressions are the reasons why people don't get along because they think different about each other.

In my experience on first impressions are always bad, because when I'm going to talk to someone and the first thing I do before talking to them is judge them in good way. For example, if I'm going to a new school and I go my first day of classes, and I don't know no one in that school, and I want to talk to someone or be friends with someone, I'm going to have to talk to people in the new school, and before I talk to them I always think if they are good people or bad people. And if think that someone is bad, but in reality she/he is a really nice person. That is an example of first impressions.

I think that if you're trying to change your first impressions is going to be difficult, because you can't change something that is going to happen before you meet someone new. First impressions is something that every human has in their lives and they can't change it, because is a part of their lives.

2D8C767B44E7,"The question is Electoral or Election. Well i choose election because the election is a better way of letting the oters express their ideas. In such ways as they could compare and contrast. They could also pick wich one they think is the most proficiant. Unlike the electorals they choose the people that will decide the president so there for they could and may lie to the judges and tell them a certain thing but then do a different thing that is also a well asked questions.

Electoral could have a positive outcome sometimes as such it can have a negative outcome. Election can also have positive and negative points. But i think that election could have a better chance of succeding because of the voters. Stated in paragraph 11 says ( The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.) well there we have it people are already questioning that choice. Some proses that ties that vote could and may not be acurate.

Election also has some bad features like some might say its the most basic level but it also is unfair in some ways. That statement or opinion is based on each individuals point of view. We dont all look at the choices in the same way. That is very important to try to undestand each choice and look at them closely. To be honest i think both have good ideas but election has a better outcome from my point of view.

Electoral or Election. I say Election both are extremely simialar but also very different. Deciding a president is very important in any situation. The Outcome of choosing then turning out that it was a miss understanding is very ploral. We have to put the outcomes of both out there and examine each and every one closely.

F42FF5B7D208,"Teachers have more often than not been the epicenter of academic negativity. There always has been and always will complain about teaching styles. If students could take the steering wheel, chances are they will understand the material taught and retain that information. That said, summer projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed because it allows for a more positve and creative atmosphere, improved scheduling, and higher pass rates.

Virtually nobody wants to spend their summer doing classwork and projects. However, if the projects were both educational and entertaining, then summer would be that much more enjoyable. It would also allow the content to soak in much better. For instance, say a student wanted to to a project on auto mechanics. With a teacher designed rubric, the would want the project to be somewhat generc in its presentation. On the flip side of that, if the rubric was composed by students, that student now has a variety of options as far as presentation. Creativity and individudality are things that schools should integrate into their cirriculum.

Also, if projects were student based, then the due dates would be rather reasoable. intstead of having to worry about one big poject, student could decide to break the project up into shorter, more managable dates. It would also allow for a more balanced schedule in general.

Some people say that if the old rubric works, then keep on using it. They have been working for years now, so why change it; because students are sick and tired of repititon. Doing the same thing over and over for an extended amount of time is not good. It starts to blur the summers together, to the point where someone will not remember what they did because of the summers being so similar. If projects are mandatory over the summer, schools should make them enjoyable and worth the students' time. That way they undestand the material and they pass that class.

With that being said, student designed projects are the much better route. With students being able to choose the subject and presentation style of the project, it will allow for creative juices to flow through everyones' minds and really intrigue the students. It would also allow for better time management on the development of said project. Finally, if students are interested in their projects and they genuinely want to do it, then the grades will improve. They will also be able to gather and retain the information that is being introduced to them. So, if you are thinking about doing this Generic_School, do it right",0,persuade_corpus,,0
2640CD15FE02,"What I think about classes online for kids who live far is that is not a good idea. It would distract tramandestly distract them from actully learn online. School should just upgrade transportation, and start school a little late.

Some schools offer classes online, for those students who trouble far distances to attend school. In my opion I think schools should not offer classes online. Do to the cause that now a days, student would prefer to hangout with their friends at parties, games, sleepover, and more. Student wouldnt pay as much attention as if they were in school. Student from short distance would probably argue about wanting classes online too. Some students might even want to wake up later then usual. I've seen some students who skip school becuase they wake up late, and they live far away. Some get late to school.

Student coming late to school, because they live far away. Schools should upgrade trasnportation instead of oferring classes online. Student from far away sometimes dont have any ride to school, therefore schools should invest in more capeable busses. The classes online would be fine for summer school. Since some kids fail classes during school year, they could retake the classes during summer, and the classes would be online.

Although the government makes assumptions that there is no safe car without a human driver, the steps being taken towards a future with driverless cars are showing a different alternative to human drivers.

Many of these driverless cars still require a form of human drivers to guide vehicles through special situations such as road blocks or work zones however, there are now many driverless vehicles that can transport a passenger without any problems. As these vehicles become more popular, affordable, and practical in everyday life it will cause a change in the driver laws for human controlled and driverless cars. With projected release dates for these modern vehicles approaching so fast it is now time for us to begin thinking about the future. Driverless cars are the future.

There is a future for driverless cars and that future is now. Driverless cars have the ability to change lives positively and remove many of the dangerous actions we face now in driving. There will be no more fear of texting and driving or an adult not being able to focus on the road while checking their child. No more fear of drunk drivers or operators under the influence. Driverless cars are more important to the safety of our country than many realize.

So let's begin to take the initiative to bring driverless cars to the forefront of technology and make these technologies accessible to the public. There is a great need for these products that must be filled as soon as possible. Driverless cars are the future and that future is now the present.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
07CDFB21E155,"Some know think venus is not a planet. Some know venus is a planet but we all can agree that it is very intresting but why would we use resources to get to venus here are some reasons why and not allow me to show you if it,s worth it. venus is not the farthest planet it is actually not too far so it makes it a viable option. The only thing is is that we have not been able to examine venus with amount of distance between earth and venus which doesn,t give us a lot of options but here is what we do know.

First of all venus is known as earths twin and it,s not called earths twin for no reason. Venus is the same size and density which would make it more acustomed to our way of liveing. sometimes venus is actually even the closest planet so if we timed it right it would make it less the journey. The only things is not a single unmanned ship has not survived for more than a few hours when sent to venus.

Basically this tells us at the moment that mars is a more viable option because we have actually landed unmanned ships on it to collect data this is why many people talk about mars instead of venus. Some problems that get in our way is the air venus has a thick atmosphere 97 percent is carbon dioxide. Not only that but venus atmosphere has highly corrosive acid the eviorment is much more harsh than earth.

This means that it will be a long time before we get to venus are bodies have adapted to earth over the years but it took over 2000 years for us to adapt to this level we can,t wait that long. Our savior nasa is actually coming with ideas to get us there at the moment they have been thinking of makeing blimp like vechile which will hover and fly high to avoid storms and what not. Though it would still be hot but the air pressure is close enough to sea level.

What to expect from nasa in the furture a blimp that might make us be able to get more data from venus. Maybe one day we will be able to inhabit venus with the ideas they are coming up with. The fact of the matter is that it,s going to a long time until we get their. So it seems mars is the better option for now. ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
32834C842C36,"Do you honestly think that from reading the article "" Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and from reading theories and looking at pictures of the face that it is a real face? Honestly people it is a natural landfrom. If you look at the three pictures taken in the years 1976,1998, and 2001 you see that it is very blurry at first, but then throughout the years you get a better look at it. As the years go on the ""face"" loses its shape and doesn't look much like a face anymore. The landform is cracking and it looks from the sky like a mound.

My first reason I think that the face is just a landform is that the way it is indented, it could be a mountain or a tall hill. If so, then you could see how between the years 1998 and 2001 the face could have had an avalanch or a simailiar situation happen to it. Cracks form and it looks like by 2001 the left side of the face has a huge indentation in it. If you look closely in the 2001 image taken from the spaceship ""Viking 1""

if you look at the outline of the face's shape, you will see how it kind of slants up like a slide. That is reason to beleive that the Face could be a hill, or a mountain or even a small or large mound.

Okay so econdly, do you believe in god? If you do then did you ever think that since god created everything, that he might have created this so we could study off of it and learn scientific facts. He could have put it there so we can study it and learn and eduacationally grow smarter with this. Another scenario is he put it there so people who want to be scientists or astronauts, that they could see this out in space and have a deeper curiosity for the thin they love and are interested in, whether that is space, or landforms or astrophysics. You never know it could happen.

I can see how you might think that this face structure is not a natural landform. You never know it could be a mound put there covering dead bodies. I know it sounds gross, but think if there is or was another species out there living on mars. Aliens or extra terrestrial creatures could have buried important objects or heirlooms to them there or have buried family or other creatures who have passed on there. You never know, but I can see why you might think that the face is not a natural landform. If I think about it too much my curiosity is kind of wanting to believe all of the unknown stuff such as history or mysteries unknown and veiled by this ""face"" object.

It could be a landform of mysterious identity. It could be a mound of buried treasure or bodies. We may never know. As it says in the passage,"" An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called Cydonia"" [1] This face object may just be there to arise our curiosity. But one thing is for sure. This face in the region of Cydonia on the red planet of Mars is a mystery for sure.

34FF5653BC2A,"With just one word your whole view of something could change in an instant. I believe if you listen to multiple opinions you will make better choices. It could be changed from making a tough¬†decision by listening to others or by being open to different view by listening to more than one opinion.

One way asking for multiple opinions can help is when your making thought decisions. One way is multiple opinions can help tell someone the pros and cons. When you are deciding on getting something expensive someone would want to have a second opinion on that so they would go and look at review to get a better idea of if it is worth it or not. When someones deciding on doing something but cant get that one thing that will convince them enough another opinion can tip them over to see whether or not they should or should not. One opinion can dramatically change someone position. If someone feels like their opinion supports one side but then hears about somebody else opinion it could change there opinion in an instant. With that opening up to a different opinion in a hard situation can help a lot.

With having multiple opinions when someones deciding on something they can show different viewpoints on that situation which could help a lot when deciding on something. One way that could work is if someone sees a different view you can see different experience someone had with it like if someone wanted to buy something and looked at all the reviews of that item they could have a better understanding about what there getting. Most people opinions are very valid opinions that cold persuade someone but sometimes another persons opinion could persuade them even more than the other one for example if someone is trying to get advice from someone but there advice really did not convince them well enough but then went to another Pearson who did persuade there opinion. If someone only gets one opinion then they will not really know about it enough to make a good decision. Say that someone wanted to become a lawyer but the only view they got from it was that it pays a lot but if they had gotten another view point they could have learned about the struggle of getting to that place. If people can open up to other opinions they can have a easier time to make there decisions.

Finally the last way that it would be bad to not get a second opinion is not knowing the other side that could affect someone in a bad way. One way that it would be bad is that¬†someone might not know about the other view. If someone only listen to one opinion they will never realize about the other opinions people have that could make them have a valid decision. A viewpoint can persuade someone without them realizing the other side. If someone opinion is a strong opinion that could be the only thing that they need to be persuaded without realizing about the full thing. My last point is that only seeing one view can affect on how someone look at that one thing. If someone looks at a doctor and think that they want to be one so they can make a lot of money but never had someone else voice there opinion and tell them that its a very hard thing to accomplish than they will never realize it until it is too late for them. to close that out people should always be open to multiple opinions.

In Conclusion having multiple opinions on something could make them have a better choice on what to pick from having an opinion on making tough¬†decisions, multiple opinions show different viewpoint, and only knowing one side can affect a decision in a bad way. If more people just instead of being self centered start to be open minded and have other peoples opinion flow threw there heads then there lives would change for the better.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
822F6C3B3C03,"I agree with Thomas Jefferson quote,""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" because yes we may always be doing something but we never really put in mind what we really are going to do.

One way to be able to accomplish things is if you have a goal set. If you set a goal that means you are going to want to achieve it. Prove others that you can do it and that nothing can stop you from doing it. Always give it your best, never think negative because if you think negative then you're never going to accomplish anything in life. Prove to yourself that you can also try new things and that can help you a lot.

Always be confident in yourself no matter what. Always put in mind that you can do whatever you want to do. For example, if you have to mow the lawn but you're in your bedroom laying down looking out the window, the lawn isn't going to mow itself because it needs someone to move it around. Trying new things doesnt hurt at least trying for quite some time and it also benefits you because you're doing something for your own good.

Never use laziness as an excuse to not do anything. If you always say i'm tired then you're never going to do anything, you're just giving up on yourself.

For example, if you hate being home all day doing nothing, then go out go find what you can do because if you try new things you'll end up liking it. If you're an active person you'll accomplish way more than expected because you're going to be moving around and getting out you're comfort zone. Helping others also can be a way in accomplishing more than just sitting there because you're talking to someone or showing someone how to do something. Helping the community in many different ways can also be a good thing but not just for you but the community, because you're going out and helping. Doing and trying new things motivates you to keep doing more.

I strongly do believe that if you're doing something that you put your mind to, then you're always going to accomplish more than expected. If you sit down and say you're going to do something you'll never do it because you're just sitting down. Your words are way different than your actions.

F1F3B4EA6FC4,"Starting at a young age and throughout their life, every child and person wants to be great at something. If you look at the people who are truly great at what they do, they all started their passion at a young age. Many sports players, politicians, and people in all fields are a great example of this. Quite frankly, extracurricular¬†activities are a great way to spur interest within students in their youth. For this reason, I believe that the principal made the right decision about making students do at least one extracurricular activity. Beside for getting students to develop an interest and passion for something at a young age, extracirrular activities also help people become more confident in their abilities. Additionally, with all of these options, there has to be at least one activity for each student to have an interest in.

As I stated earlier, extracurricular activities are a great way to get students to find a new interest. For all you know, the student may really like the activity and pursue it as a profession. Without being required to do the activity, the student may not have even discovered their interest in whatever the activity is. Requiring students to do extracurricular is a great way to open new door and possibilities for the student. There are many different activities the student can take, so at least one has to be appealing. By finding out what they have an interest in, and starting at a young age, the student will have plenty of time to develop the skills need at get really good at something. It is important to be unique in at least one thing, because it helps identify who you are as a person. Even if the student does not ""fall in love"" with their activity, it still could not hurt to try something new.

Staying on the topic of learning something new, extracirrular activities are a great way to get students out of their comfort zone and to build up self-confidence. If the school did not require the student to take an extracurricular activity, chances are that the student would not have tried out something new. By making students try something new or continue something that they are already good at, it is making them better at whatever they are doing. This boosts their confidence level, and makes them want to try even more new things. Additionally, many of these clubs and activities include working with other people and students. This means that these clubs help students with their communication, organization, and teamwork skills. Personally, I am on my school's debate team, and I enjoy not only having fun and tournaments, but also working with my friends that are also on the team. Even though I do not really plan on becoming a lawyer or politician, I still feel as if being on the team has made me a more confident and clear speaker. Helping develop important life skills is once again another benefit of making requiring students to take at least one extracurricular activity.

Whether it is a sport, club, or leadership position, there is always something for each and every student. Based on the field that the person wants to go in, they can do an activity that is related to that field. For example, if the person wanted to be a politician, they could do something relating to the student council. Out of the many choices for extracurricular activities, at least one has to fit each student. Even if the student is not sure what they want to be, there are also plenty of options such as sports that are plenty of fun!

Although some people may say that it is not right to force somebody into doing an activity, or say that there are better things the person can do with that time, the whole purpose of requiring students to do after school¬†activities is so they can get better. Not only do extracurricular¬†actitivites help give students important life skills, but they also give students a chance to gain an interest and passion in an activity. If anything, it just giving the students another opportunity to try out something new. It is almost guaranteed that every student will find something that they can manage, so there is no downsides of requiring students to do extracurricular¬†activities.

As I mentioned earlier, it is best for people start something at a young age, and requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a great way to do that.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,6

976BC9C79AD2,"Dear Senator,

Pensive and melancholic, the debate on whether or not the Electoral College should be kept has had the people thinkinf for many years now. As you already know the process of the Electoral College consists of electors meeting and voting for the president and vice president. Therefore, the people voting only help choose the state's electors when voting for their president. In reality, we all know that when we vote we are actually choosing our candidate's electors. Because of this the people feel like their voice isn't being heard. They believe that they aren't actually voting for their president.

For starters, the majority of people, over 60 percent of the voters, would prefer a direct election instead of having an Electoral College. Under the system we have now voters can't always control who their electors vote for. Sometimes there is a problem where we choose the wrong elector and in turn vote for the incorrect candidate. The majority of people voting feel that their vote does not really count because electors can go against what they promised, and they can vote for whoever they wanted to vote for.

In addition to this, there is a problem if there is a tie in the electoral votes. In the event of this the election would be passed to the House of Represenatatives. This means that it is up to state delegations to vote on the president.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,8
CF961DD37C82,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the effects of technology on people's communication and feeling of loneliness as an average 8th grade student:

Technology has changed the way people communicate and interact with each other in a lot of ways. With the rise of social media, messaging apps, and video calls, it's easier than ever to stay in touch with friends and family who are far away. But at the same time, some people argue that technology is making us feel more lonely and disconnected from each other.

One of the biggest advantages of technology is that it allows us to connect with people from all over the world. You can make new friends, share ideas, and learn about different cultures through social media and messaging apps. Video calls make it feel like you're talking to someone in person, even if you're on the other side of the world. This can be really helpful for people who have moved away from their hometown or who have family and friends in different countries.

But there are also some disadvantages to relying on technology for communication. For one thing, it can be really easy to misinterpret someone's tone or intentions through a screen. This can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings, especially if you're not able to see each other in person. And because technology is so convenient, some people might use it as a substitute for in-person communication, which can make them feel more isolated and lonely in the long run.

Personally, I think technology can be both good and bad for communication. It's great to be able to stay in touch with my friends who moved away, but sometimes I feel like I'm missing out on the emotional connection that comes with in-person communication. I also think it's important to set limits on how much time you spend on technology, so you don't get too caught up in your screens and forget about the people around you.

In conclusion, technology has both advantages and disadvantages when it comes to communication and feeling of loneliness. While it can make it easier to stay in touch with people who are far away, it can also lead to misunderstandings and feelings of isolation. It's important to find a balance and use technology in a way that promotes healthy communication and connection with others",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

When we make mistakes or experience failure, it can be humbling, but it can also be incredibly rewarding if we are willing to learn from it. Making a mistake or experiencing failure teaches us valuable lessons about ourselves and our abilities. We develop resilience and humility, and learn from our shortcomings. We also become better strategists and problem solvers, since we have already experienced failure and had the opportunity to think critically about our actions. 

Learning from our mistakes or failures also leads to a more positive mindset. By accepting that no one is perfect, we become more accepting of ourselves and more realistic in our expectations. It also helps us to be more forgiving towards ourselves when we make mistakes, knowing that we can take whatever lessons we can from them and use them as stepping stones to our success.

EFA611CC05CC,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. The article is mainly about whether not driverless cars will or will not be useful in the future. Driverless cars may be useful in the future but there are both positive and negative aspects of these cars.

Positive aspects stated directly from the article is that the sensors of the cars will be more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. In paragraph 4 it states that "" Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" This is important imformation that highly supports the positve aspect of driverless cars.

Although driverless cars are advanced but there are also negative aspects of these smart cars. In paragraph 7 most of driverless cars are listed and it directly states that, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through the work zones and aroung accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM had developed driver's seats the vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under considerations are flashing lights on the windshields and other heads-up displays. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" These are the main negative aspects of driverless cars.

In my opinion I am for the development of these cars. Because we had come so far with technology, so far that most technology seem nearly impossible. I believed that in a few years from here that the will have driverless cars perfect with no negative aspects. Because soon enough we wouldn't need to remain completely focused and wait for your turn to drive. So far driverless cars have many negative aspects but those negative aspects are decreasing because we are finding ways to help make driverless cars advanced.

Driverless cars will be amazing once it is perfect with no negative aspects. We are just waiting for the law to approve driverless cars. Driverless cars may have positive and negative aspects but I believe we can have these car perfect in just a few more years.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

DAF9AC30424E,"Extending the school day by an extra hour would be an undue burden on students of all ages. Students already face long days filled with classes, extracurriculars, and work or family obligations. Adding an extra hour would leave little time for students to focus on self-care or devote time to their hobbies. Furthermore, students tend to have diminishing returns of productivity after a certain number of hours in the school day. Their mental and physical exhaustion can cause them to have difficulty paying attention and comprehending new material. 

Also, too much schooling can lead to burnout in students, who are already pushed to their limits due to the increasing demand for good grades and extracurricular activities. Burnout can lead to students feeling overwhelmed and lacking the motivation to engage in their studies, which can have a detrimental effect on their academic performance.

An extended school day can also take away from other important activities that are essential to a student‚Äôs wellbeing and long-term success. Relaxation time and pursuing hobbies can help students develop qualities like creativity, perseverance, and critical thinking, which are all key to success in the real world.

Based on these reasons, I believe an extended school day would be an unnecessary burden on students, and should not be implemented.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Write an essay arguing why the school day should not be extended by an extra hour.,1
68D68DA97502,"Imagine you're a teacher and you have to grade a project that you had no part in creating. Some schools are considering allowing students to design their own summer assignments. This would be counter-productive because, if students were allowed to design their own summer projects they would make the projects entirely too easy. When teachers design the summer assignment they can make sure that it follows the curriculum. It is also easier for teachers to grade assignments that they designed.

Some people believe that, allowing students to create their own assignments would increase the number of students who complete summer assignments. However, many students would create a project that would not teach them anything, and be a waste of time. More students would turn in assignments at the beginning of the school year, but the quality of many assignments would be very poor. What would happen is, students would spend all summer playing games and enjoying their break, and then the last couple days of break would be to throw together a project without putting any thought into it.

Secondly, when teachers design projects they can be sure that it follows the curriculum and provides a smooth transition from one school year to the next. If students were to design their summer assignments, without knowing the curriculum of the coming school year, the assignments would have little to no relevance to the course. This could confuse students when the subject matter of the course is completely different from the summer assignment. It is important for the summer assignments to be designed by the teachers, to ensure that they actually apply to the class that they are assigned by.

Lastly, it is easier for teachers to grade projects that they created. The beginning of the school year is a busy, and stressful, time for everyone. Teachers do not need the extra stress of having to grade dozens of projects that are all designed differently. It is much easier for teachers to grade the dozens of projects when all of the projects follow the same basic guidelines. When projects are designed by the teachers who will grade them it greatly reduces the stress on the teachers in the, already hectic, beginning of the school year.

In conclusion, summer assignments should be designed by teachers, so that they can be sure that the assignments are an appropriate difficulty, relevant to the coursework, and have the same structure. I encourage you to speak with, call, or email members of your local school board to prevent this proposed change. For the good of the students, as well as teachers.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

In many countries around the world people have reduced the amount of time they use their cars and the outcome has been phenomenal. Heidrun Walter was asked about how she felt about taking cars out of her life, she answered ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Rosenthal par3.

The car has now become a household item. Cars are one of the main reasons why our ozone layer is open and we responsible for ""50 percent...of greenhouse gases emissions"" Roseenthal par5. It's shocking to see how far we have advanced but to see how much we have destroyed in the world at the same time is crazy. Paris has become so poluted that they had to get a ""partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" Duffer par10.

B8656754E9EB,"Mistakes: The Path to Self-Improvement

Mistakes. We've all made them. Big or small, they're a part of life. But what if I told you that mistakes aren't just a natural part of life, but they can also be a stepping stone to becoming a better human being? It might sound counterintuitive, but think about it. When we make mistakes, we learn. We learn from our mistakes, we reflect on them, and we grow.

For example, let's say you're trying to cook a new recipe for the first time. You follow the instructions to the letter, but when you taste the final product, it's disgusting. You made a mistake in the recipe, but instead of getting frustrated and giving up, you take the time to analyze what went wrong. You realize that you added too much salt, or that you didn't cook the ingredients long enough. You learn from your mistake and try again, and this time, you get it right. You've not only learned a new recipe, but you've also learned how to be more careful and precise in your cooking.

Or let's say you're trying out for the school play and you bomb your audition. You feel devastated and disappointed, but instead of giving up, you take the time to reflect on what went wrong. You realize that you were nervous and didn't prepare enough, so you practice more and work on your confidence. You try out again and this time, you nail it. Not only did you get the part, but you also learned how to handle nerves and prepare better for future auditions.

Personally, I've made my fair share of mistakes, but one that stands out to me is when I accidentally spilled paint all over my art project. I was so upset and frustrated, but my teacher encouraged me to see it as an opportunity to experiment and try something new. I learned how to mix different colors and create a new design, and I ended up with a piece of art that I was actually proud of.

In conclusion, mistakes are not just a natural part of life, but they can also be a path to self-improvement.

Profeser Nicu was from the University of Ansterdam. I'm against the vaule of using computer techonology to read students emotions.

One example that the authour gives is where the process begins. The text states"" the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D coumputer model of the face"". The FACS has classifies six basic emotions which are: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These emotions are associted with the movement of the facial muscles

Another example that the author gives is web ads on your screen. The text says ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a simalr might follow. Most student thay communicate is nonverbal. Dr. Haung put that video games and surgery on his notes.

One vaule of haveing techonlogy might help teachers know what students might be feeling even if the student doesn't want them to know. If the student is feeling sad or stressed the teacher can help with that through communication. Empathy is (feeling someone else's emotional state).

I believe student will get more offers online,therefor, benefits online offers are, students will have less stress and more help form teachers,more focus on there work also less distraction. I also would say that online has everyone going on about also kids in school have used phones so maybe it is time to move on to something new.

My first reason is that some kids who are slow learns in¬†a class with a lot of students in there class , are kids who will have more trouble¬†in class . Slow learning¬†kids get easily distraction by anything in class also more like not to finish there work and instant of doing there work they will¬†talk to there peers . Also there are other problems like, there are many¬†kids that would need a teachers help but she can only help one kid at a time. Therefor,¬†some of the kids don't get the help they need. Also some the kids who are trying to do there work would be disturb by the noise in the classroom which will cause the student¬†to get frosted.

Take a kid for example,¬†in school things are going great for her and¬†she has friends and she doing good in school ,¬†then out of know where her grads drop and she lost her friends and now she doesn't want to do anything anymore and she stops trying also this cause her to hate school because of problems in school . This is the other reason .

My third reason is the online videos. The online videos can help students finish the work they didn't had time for,students will have less difficult on there classwork they will have more time understanding form the videos that help them. Student that are in class will have more trouble cashing up with the class because teachers¬†would like to move up to the next topic. this the reason kids in class are be hide and have no time to finish.

my least reason ,I believe that some the kids skip school because they find school not import and the reason they feel that way because there going through stuff at school and they don't want to be there when bad times come and kids find school unsafe and things could happen in school and nobody would know about it. So stay home and doing work online is a better idea.

These are all the reason kids should take¬†online class at home , this¬†gives you safety and this can help in your needs and to keep you¬†up with others in class also¬†teachers can help you more likewise¬†this gives you more time .

FEBA954A3D88,"Exploring Venus has its pros and cons. Both have its challenges and risks. Venus is a very interesting planet to study due to the fact that it is the only one like earth, but there are risks. throughout this essay I will tell you my reasoning on why the author didn't exactly prove to me that Venus is worth taking risks for.

It states in paragraph two,"" Each mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in the more than three decadeas."" This peice of evidence shows that Venus is not a safe enviroment for electronics to land on so why would you potentially send humans to this planet even though a spacecraft couldn't surive. This statement also had no followup counterarguement; there was no sentence to make me want to change my mind.

It also states in paragraph three,"" On the planets surface, temperatures avergae over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" This piece of the paragraph again identifies the risks but now into more detail. There is no followup counterargument, so again this author is making me completely against the idea of sending life to Venus.

It states in paragraph four,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This statement is one of the only pros that I have encountered from the author so far. This makes me think that this could be a good idea, especially due to the fact that Venus has some of the same features of earth.

The author then goes on to say,"" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as out jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At the thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit. But the air pressure would be close to that of se level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This paragraph finally gives a safe solution to exploring Venus in a habitable way. However in the sixth paragraph the author states,"" Therefor, scientists seeking to conduct a throrough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This statement shows how the trip to Venus would be a waste of time if you cannot get on the surface. There is no point doing this exploration because any human life will not survive if you get too close to the surface.

In conclusion the author did not convinve me that traveling to venus is worthy expidition. The author mainly explained the cons of the study and did not provide too many pros. The author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.          ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

Why should this summer project should be student designed not teacher designed? If student have a choice of who came up an idea to write about they would most likely choose them self. This summer project due til student go back to school telling that student have lot of time to come up with an idea to write about. Student can come with an idea quickly because they can what they do and write about that they also can write what they do during the break.

If the student start their summer project student can be creative with their work by putting effort into it. student can choose if they want to do it colorful and creative or plain student have a choice if they want their work all bright and pretty or simple and plain. If the student choose colorful and creative there work might include with picture, color, detail, and what they might do during break showing that whoever made this work put a lot¬†of thought and effort into it. If the student want to be simple with their work they might include white background, all word telling what they do during break, and a lot¬†of mess of pencil mark. whatever they choose to be creative or not they will end up using their head to come up with these idea and student can make their project exciting or boring it up to them.

If student do this summer project and let the student to do their designed it will show that student put a lot of work into their project. The most difficult part of this project is come up with good idea to do. Coming up idea can be hard and stressful it show that student put a lot of thought into their work. While student work on their design something they think what would be great to put into their design like color if so what kind would be best, picture if so what kind,and patter.

7EE30A511B75,"Dear Principal,

I think that changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they maintain a grade B average instead of a grade C average is a great idea. Not only will this encourage students increase their grade average, but it will reward the students who have higher grades.

Many students consider being able to participate in activities or privilege that they want. This means that students will want to raise their grades in order to be able to have this privilege. I know I would. Many students don't try hard to do over the bare minimum of a C average, so they could be able to participate in activities and sports, but raising the minimum to a B would mean that everyone would need to try harder if they would want to be able to participate in activities. Students who do not keep an average high enough to play sports would have more time for studying, so that they can raise their grade high enough to play in sports.

Students who have a high enough grade to play will be rewarded and will feel special about having higher grades. This will encourage them to try even harder and be a better student. This could give them a better chance at getting into a more respectable college, and bring them more success over the course of their lifetime.

I think that you should increase the grade average required to participate in activities, because it will encourage students who aren't doing too well to do better, and even the students who are already achieving the required marks to do better, resulting in them to have a better quality education.

Sincerely, a concerned student.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,4

36820FEFBDCA,"Dear Mr./Ms. Senator,

I think it would be a good idea to change the election by popular vote for election of our president. It would be a good idea for a few reasons. One it doesn't fully represent the people, (or general population.) For example, Persident Obama in the 2012 election only recieved 51.3% of the population vote. However because of the Electoral College, he was able to become the president of the United States. And us, the voters, well we aren't even voting for our president. According to source two,

The Indefensible Electoral College , "" Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" So us the people aren't even voting, do our votes really even count? Say i live in a state like Maine, then i only have 4 electoral votes, oppose to a big state like Texas, who according to the map in the third source have ""38 electoral votes"". My vote really doesnt even count. Because of the amount of votes your state gets in the upcoming election relys on the population. But every state only gets one final vote. so say Wyomming gets just as many votes as Texas, who represents 35 million voters. Do you see how this is unfair? And then theres the ""Disaster Factor"", This can destroy anyones chances at becoming president. It happened in the 60's it happened in the 2000 election, it can happen anytime. The Disaster factor is when repressentatives vote for whom ever they please. When this happened in the 60's rasists almost succeded in a plan to bump President Kennedy from the office. they were going to replace all the electors with different people to go up against Kennedy. The electors can bassically do what ever they please, considering we voted them in. They casn defy us as much as they please. In the 1968 election, just a mere 8 years after the would be catastropy of the segragationists, a tie, yes a tie, almost occured. It was about 10,000 votes away form a ""deadlock tie"". According to the second source, "" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" They basically told the swing voters to take it off their hands and vote for who they pleased. These are just a few of the reasons why The Electoral College is Outdated and needs the be repalced.

For instance, skills such as better time management, organization, writing, and study techniques can be developed over the four year period. This can help students apply these skills to their college courses, eventually translating into better grades and success. 

On the contrary, leaving high school one year earlier than traditional can be challenging. Without the full four-year curriculum, students may lack the exposure to higher level classes needed to perform well in college. Additionally, early graduation can sometimes hinder self-development, as students may miss out on important milestones that could contribute to maturity level and development. 

For example, one student left high school early in order to take a dual-enrollment course at a local college. By not experiencing a full four years of high school, the student lacked the maturity level and knowledge needed to succeed in college academics. As a result, her grades began to suffer.

It is clear that while leaving high school early can be appealing to some, it is important to consider the effects it may have on a student's future.

Transportation is the second leading cause for the emissions in the United States. Car-Free cities are starting to trend in Europe. In the car-free cities you no longer have to worry about where to park. We need to lower the amount of emissions we produce on a daily bases, for America most of our emissions are from gas while in Paris the emissions come from diesel.

Paris has been really polluted, there is much smog that they had decided to ban driving, whoever drove recieved a fine on that day. Paris would take turns on the license plate number to determine if you could drive that day or not. A car-free day in Bogota, Colombia had many people walking, hiking and taking the bus. The streets were free or almost free from traffic jam,violaters who did not participate were fined.

Obama has recently announced that he would like for America to lower the emissions we produce. Statistics show that less people are purchasing cars also there are less people getting their drivers license. In Vauban, Germany they do not just go a day without cars, it is a suburb where street parking are forbidden, it is an expermental site where people are to be without cars. People from there are much happier they no longer have to worry about traffic or congestion they just walk, ride a bike or bus. 70% of Vauban families do not own a car. Cars can cause us to be stressed and it even harms the enviroment.

The money that the city gets from the violators would be used to make the community a much better and clean place. Although it is limited it does not mean you cannot use your car, but you may want to live in another area if you keep getting fined.

Some people have trouble deciding over items, so the person could look for multiple people to help them decide, one person could say one thing and another person could say a different thing, the person would have to ask more people and base it off of the reasons he was given. Reasons why people should ask more than one person is that they can have more than one answer or opinion, and it can help them decide through multiple ideas.

People should ask for multiple opinions because they can acquire more than one answer. Having more than one answer can help you decide. Generic_Name could not decide on which pack of bananas to choose at the store so she asked two workers which they preferred best. Another reason why you should have more than one answer is so you would have more to work with. Generic_Name asked people which lawn chair was the best to purchase, he obtained multiple answers and used them to choose a lawn chair.

Many people should ask for multiple opinions because it can help them decide through the ideas they obtain. A reason for that is that it can make for a better decision. Generic_Name acquired multiple ideas from asking people so she can make a better decision on what she is going to purchase. Having multiple ideas to decide with can help you have more to work with.

I don't believe it would be a good decision because one, it would take up so much time, secondly, who says it calculates what is going on in your mind or your true feelings, thirdly why use it in classrooms of all places. There are just many more places it could be used rather than a classroom. Teachers have it hard enough grading the million and one asignments than going through and analyzing their students faces.

First, the Facial Action Coding System will take so much time in one class alone, we can't take away the education from the children in order to see what are emotions are by a face scanner. Let's say you are in a 55 minute math class notes take 30 to 40 minutes a day and the teaher lets students have the beginning 10- 15 minutes of class to ask about last nights homework that all equals 40-55 minutes a day. How would you fit 30 kids into a 10 minute slot to face scan them? That is one more obstical you are going to ask teachers to jump over when they already do so much and get paid so little.

Secondly, Just because a persons face says they are feeling a certain way doesn't mean that is how they truly feel. That is like saying put this mood ring on so I can see your mood. We all know mood rings are based off of body temperature and not your actual mood. There are somethings that people are feeling that they don't want to show, I am not saying that this is a bad thing to do, but maybe not for classrooms.

Thirdly, why in classrooms of all places? Children are very clumbsy there is a better chance it won't get broken at a docotrs office or maybe at a hospital, or anywhere else besides around children. The best place for this could be at a psychiactic unit to see how the psychiatic medication has effected the paitent from day one to now. Children aren't going to be in the same mood now if you check in on them in five minutes.

In conclution, schools should not have these. I think the Facial Action Coding System could be put to use somewhere else besides in a school.

CA4E67209D3C,"Why is it important to ask multiple people for advice than just to ask one person. If you ask one person for advice you will probably get the same answer every time. Also you would be able to see how some of the ideas that are wrong. So asking advice from multiple people can help you get a different point of view¬†on things, so you could try new ideas, and so you could see the bad idea.

One reason why seeking help from multiple people is because it would let you see things in different perspectives or point of views. One point of view could be like you should sell drugs. The other point of view¬†is that you should not sell drugs. Then you start asking more people and more people are saying that you should not sell drugs.

Another reason why seeking advice from multiple people is that you could try a new idea. so lets say someone says ""you should go rock wall climbing"". Then another person says ""you should go swim with sharks"". You start asking and you go swim with sharks and then you climbed a rock wall.

Finally, why you should look for advice from multiple people is because it will show you all the negative ideas. One of those ideas could be to go break into a bank. Now this could be your best friend saying this. then you start asking around and people are saying that this is a bad idea. Right then and there the guy realized maybe¬†my friend is not who he is.

All in all these few paragraphs show that looking for advice is a good thing. one reason is that it will show you all the different point of views from people. Another reason is that it will show you new ideas. Finally it will show you the bad ideas. All these show that asking multiple people for advice is a good thing.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
C67BED973A39,"Dear State Senator, I am feeling the need to change the Ellectoral College to election by popular votes for the president of the united states. I feel this way for three reasons. The first reason is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now. The second reason is because under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The last reason is because the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters.

The first reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes,is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the Electoral College still has it's defenders. That was the first reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The second reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes, is because under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, butr for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. So the Electoral College usually wins since the votes go in to the House of Representatives first, which is really unfair to the other people that are doing the election. That was the second reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The last reason why I think that they need to change the Ellectoral College to election by popular votes, is because at the most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair nto voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. But it's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arrguments in favor of it are mostly asserstions without much basis in reality. That was the last reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

State senator i'm writing you this letter so you can hopefully change the Electoral College to election by popular votes. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. so the only last words that I have to say to you are: Abolish the Electoral College!    ",0,persuade_corpus,,3

F3DCBC704B3C,"Most people think that trusting their instinct or quick thoughts are reliable ways to answer even the easiest questions, but that's not always the case. ""Ask 3 before me"" Is what teachers would say in school. This would mean that asking other people gives a better result. Asking for multiple opinions helps people make better choices because the person may be smarter, a chance for the person asking to learn, and if more people are asked then a result would be a more diverse set of answers.

A person never knows how smart the person they're asking for an opinion is. For all they know the person they are asking might not even be as smart as the person asking. But chances are that if the person asking got a good and reliable answer, the person they asked is smarter than the person asking. This, of course, is not always the case for all circumstances where a person needs multiple opinions. It would make sense to believe that the smarter person would have a more reliable opinion in the subject.

Asking for more than one opinion gives someone a chance to learn about the subject. For an example, say a person went up to a classmate and asked them for the due date of the math homework. That person was given the wrong date. So the person goes up another classmate and gets their opinion but this time it was right. Something like that happens in everyday life, where you are given a chance to learn through asking for help from other people. If a person doesn't know something they can just ask for help, it's as simple as that and we have all been using it since we learned how to speak. As a result of this the person is given options, since they now know about the subject.

If more people are asked then results would be more diverse. When a person asks only one person for their opinion they get one possibly unreliable answer. If 3 or more people are asked for their opinion then an outcome is the answer that most people gave. When a person is given multiple answers, they have options to choose from. When the person asking learns from the answers given to them then they would see the choice that seems right to them. As stated in the last paragraph, the more answers you get, the more you learn and thats why asking multiple people would be someone's best bet when seeking for answers.

In conclusion asking for multiple opinions helps people make better choices because the person someone is asking can be a lot smarter than the person asking, asking for opinions gives people a chance to learn, diverse answers are given if more people are asked for their opinion. A better result is given when more people are asked.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

Some advantages of not using a car is that you don't have to worry about getting in to a car wreck, you don't have to smoke up your area with all the carbon dioxide that comes out of your car, and you actually work out for once. Limiting your car usage will have you not in a hurry. Heidrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". She feels that not using a car would make her feel better.

Cars are just a waste, I see that in the future there is going to be like a lot of over weight people. No one hardly work out nowadays. Just get in the car and go somewhere instead of walking around the block. It's going to be the real version of ""WalE"" where the earth is full of trash and everyone is going to live on a spaceship and their all over weight.

Being in a car will pollute your city so fast if everyone around had a car. As it says in the article, ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". It is that way because a whole lot of people live there and almost everyone has a car over there in the two cities. Using a car will only make things better for the people and for the environment.

""BOGOTA, Colombia... millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets o this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" This excerpt from the article explains some of the advantages of not using a car. All of them sound joyful. Hiking, Biking, Skating and no traffic jams? This sounds like a field day in the city. What could go wrong with all of these delightful activites goin on?

The excerpt clearly says that without cars you could have multiple and multiple things to do besides being lazy. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" Carlos Arturo Plaza. Less stress and lower air pollution, I think that's the best combination of all. New york even has a bikesharing program so you could ride your bike all over its city. Wow ! sounds like a deal to me.

Not using a car is a great way to be yourself and do something with your life and to help others. No one likes pollution, and no one wants to be out of shape. As said by Carlos, he's stress free from cars. There's multiple sources out there that you could join and be apart of without having a car. The United States people are not using cars as much now, and all over the world people are starting programs to stop car usage.

F1860C4149BF,"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving.

Due to many statistics and other research cellular devices are the main causes of car accidents. Many scientists have proven to us that cellphones put drivers at a very great risk of getting into a wreck. Even with this information drivers still choose to use there phone behind the wheel. Drivers have even resulted to using hand free devices, because they think that this is safer. Some people use the excuse that ""If there's an emergency they may need there cellular device"" to support the face of using their phone behind the wheel. There's a lot of evidence to support why drivers should not use their phone behind the wheel.

When driving it's very hard to focus on both the road and your phone. It's very easy to forget that your sharing the road with other people. Other people on take notice to drivers being on the cellular devices even if they don't want to or not because of the hazards they create. Texting while driving is the more dangerous than talking while driving. You take your eyes off the road for one minute and boom you've gotten into a wreck.

Most of the drivers that fall into this category are teens. These drivers have the highest fatalities behind the wheel due to using a phone. In the state of Utah using your phone behind the wheel , and you cause an accident it can land you in jail for up to 15 years. Most teens use airpods made by Apple inc, instead of holding the phone in there hand. This is even more dangerous because you can't hear your surroundings.

In conclusion: if people continue to use there cellular devices behind the wheel he number of casualties on the roads they will continue to increase..

But if she/he says no phones aloud like it is now here people still use them anyway. I think the reason for no cell phones aloud is because you can talk to your friends and ask answers on test to cheat and you would interrupt the teacher if you call someone or get a call. If cell phones are aloud people would defiantly use them all day long and cheat on tests and things like that. Also at free times like in between classes and at lunch you can just go talk to your friend without using your phone because its not like you never see them unless they go to a different school. So if i had to choose one it would be option 2 that students are not aloud to use them in school so they don't cheat on tests and talk to people all day long without listening to the teacher. But be able to use them on the bus to and from school if they ride a bus because it is not disrupting the teacher and you don't have a paper like a test or a graded class work to cheat on. But i personally think that students should be able to listen to their Ipods during a test because you cant communicate with people and you are not disrupting anyone by talking, and some people do things better while listening to music like it helps a lot when your running because it keeps you mind off it but it will make you work harder on a test.

This technology has become part of our daily lives and much more than a telephone. Cell phones have now evolved into hand held computers that we carry with us every were we go, even school. This could be the next step into a more advanced future in our current educational society.

I am not claiming that we should be aloud cell phones during class periods as well because I am aware of the difficulties that could come with that. Although during the students free time they should be aloud any technology that is offered to them, otherwise if their are so many restrictions I am confused on why they call it free time. With their cell phones students are also able to email and work on certain papers or projects therefore helping them with school.

Students should still have their phones turned of f during class periods because they do cause a distraction no matter how helpful they may be. Even if this is a problem today with the current rules stating the no cell phone policy's.

CFEC920440CE,"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to understand how successful people accomplish their goals and how we can apply those lessons to our own lives. In this essay, we will explore the strategies and habits of successful CEOs, the importance of completing tasks in a timely and accurate manner, and how we can apply these lessons to our own academic and personal lives.

Firstly, let's look at successful CEOs and how they accomplish their goals. Many successful CEOs share a common trait: a strong work ethic and a focus on results. They are often willing to put in long hours and make difficult decisions in order to achieve their goals. Additionally, they have a clear vision for their company and are able to communicate that vision to their employees, inspiring them to work towards a common goal.

Now, let's consider what it takes to have a successful future. In order to achieve our goals, we must have a clear understanding of what we want to accomplish and a plan for how to get there. This requires setting specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. We must also be willing to take risks and learn from our mistakes in order to grow and succeed.

In addition to CEOs and personal success, we can also look at how workers in different industries plan and complete tasks. In any industry, it is important to have a clear understanding of the tasks at hand and to prioritize them in order of importance. This may involve breaking larger projects down into smaller, more manageable tasks and setting deadlines for each one.

Finally, let's consider how students complete their assignments. In order to succeed academically, students must be able to manage their time effectively and prioritize their tasks. This may involve creating a study schedule, breaking larger assignments down into smaller tasks, and seeking help when needed.

Overall, completing tasks in a timely and accurate manner is crucial to achieving our goals and having a successful future. Whether we are CEOs, students, or workers in any industry, we must be willing to put in the work and make difficult decisions in order to achieve our goals. By following the strategies and habits of successful people, we can learn how to plan and complete tasks effectively and ultimately achieve success in all areas of our lives.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,9
5441B7ECF4ED,"Have you ever come home from a rough day at school and just wished you had something to do that would take your mind off of your stress? Many students deal with this problem on a daily basis, and there's a way to fix it. Extracurriculars for students should be required in schools because they help reduce stress, improve time management, and look really impressive when applying for schools.

Extracurriculars are an amazing way to help reduce stress for students by taking their mind away from their problems. Students often get overloaded with schoolwork and it can cause many problems emotionally and mentally. Recent studies have shown that kids who don't take sports or music outside of school are more likely to get depression or anxiety. If extracurriculars in schools were mandatory, less kids would get overwhelmed by stress.

Not only do extracurriculars help reduce stress in students, but they also help improve time management skills. Time management is a very important skill for kids not only in school but also for their lives in the future, and extracurriculars are a great way to teach them. When students have school on top of sports and other activities, they have less time to get everything done during the day. This causes students to learn ways to get their work done as soon as possible and fit everything into a small amount of time. Students with good time management skills tend to perform better in school because they never procrastinate on studying or homework. Many studies have been done on students who take extracurriculars compared to students who don't, and the results have shown that most students with extracurriculars have higher grades. If more kids took extracurriculars outside of school, they would improve their grades as a result of improving their time management skills.

When applying for colleges there's one thing that's really appealing about an applicant, and that's their extracurriculars. When a student takes multiple extracurriculars outside of school, it makes them look very skilled compared to other applicants. This can boost up a student's possibility of getting accepted into the school they apply for. Studies on colleges and their acceptance rates have proven that kids who were involved in more activities were accepted over students who weren't. The more skills you have, the better you look compared to someone who doesn't have as many. If schools required their kids to take extracurriculars, larger amounts of their students would get accepted into colleges.

Obviously, it would be very beneficial for schools to require their students to be involved in extracurriculars. Students would be less stressed, better at managing their time, and have a higher chance of getting into college. Extracurriculars are a great way to improve a student's life, and every student should want to make their life as amazing as possible.   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Hiking can be done in a variety of settings, from local parks to national parks, making it accessible to families of all ages and abilities. Additionally, hiking can be a low-cost activity, making it a great option for families on a budget.

Hiking requires no screens, no phones, and no distractions, allowing families to focus on each other and the beauty of nature. This can be a great way to strengthen family bonds and create lasting memories.

Another advantage of hiking is that it can be a great way to teach children about the natural world. Hiking allows families to observe and learn about different plants, animals, and ecosystems. This can be a great way to instill a love of nature in children and encourage them to be more environmentally conscious.

E54E238C6DDB,"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about online classes for students who need extra help! üòÉ As an 8th grader, I know that sometimes it can be tough to keep up with schoolwork, especially when you're struggling with a particular subject. That's where online classes come in! ü§ì

So, one of the best things about online classes is that you can access help from a teacher whenever you need it. Like, you can't always get help from your regular teacher during class, but with online classes, you can get help from a teacher who's specifically trained to help you. It's like having your own personal tutor, but way more convenient! üìö

Another reason why online classes are so beneficial is that they can help you work at your own pace. Like, if you're really struggling with math, you can take an online class that's specifically designed to help you catch up. And the best part is, you can do it on your own time, so you don't have to worry about missing out on other classes. üïí

But, there are also some challenges that might prevent some students from getting the help they need. Like, sometimes the internet can be really slow or unreliable, and that can make it hard to access the online classes. And some students might not have a quiet place to work, so they might get distracted easily. üòî

27D868D68359,"Dear Principal,

I don't believe that all students should be forced to do community service.

It's a great thing to do for our community, but not everyone should be forced to do it.

To begin children would resent having to do it.

They wouldn't try their hardest to help the environment.

They would just be being forced to do it, so most people would hate it and either try to get out of it, or just hardly do anything.

The whole point of community service is to help out your community however, if you just have a bunch of kids there that would much rather be at home or with their friends than that defeats the purpose.

Instead of having a lot of unwilling kids doing community service it would be much more effective to have a handful of students that really are willing and interested in helping out in their community.

Although it's sad that not all kids want to help out, their still are a good amount that would be interested.

All people are different, whether it's in appearance or personality.

They completely are different.

Some kids would rather spend their time at home playing video games all day and others would rather help out in the community.

It's nice to think that all children would like to help out with everything but it's just not realistic.

All of humanity is different, if you forced someone who loves say art to be a fireman or woman they most likely wouldn't enjoy it.

Kids want to do things that they really enjoy and if community service isn't it than they won't apply themselves.

Another very important reason, is that students are already so extremely busy.

If you put on another thing to do they will get stretched to thin and not be able to keep up with other things that they have to do.

As students get older they get more and more homework and projects that they really need to focus on.

Not only that, is the fact that after school many people do various sports, arts, etc. that require a lot of their time.

At our age we're trying to figure out what we want to do with our lives and though community service is a great opportunity and just an excellent thing to do, it's not always on people's list of priorities.

With already so much work and activities to do, adding another thing to our plate could destroy our chances of finding something we love to do.

Also a lot of student are already doing a lot of community service.

People in SCHOOL_NAME a scholarship program at school have to do a certain number of community service hours.

And also tons of students that go to church have to.

Anyone in SCHOOL_NAME (which is most middle school students) have to fulfill a number of hours to reach a conformation.

It wouldn't be fair to add more to these kids and then others don't have to do as much.

Maybe a good idea, is to have the student council organize different ways of letting people know how important community service is.

Or even giving people that accomplish a certain number of community service hours rewards.

Doing this will make more kids that want to do community service come out and do it, instead of making people do it when they don't want to.

Students will have more fun if they have the time and want to.

It will have a much better outcome then forcing students.

B204869FA146,"Hey, so for this essay, I had to think about how technology has affected communication and social interaction. And, like, it's pretty wild how much it's changed things.

So, on the one hand, technology has made it way easier to communicate with people. Like, you can send a text or an email to someone and they can respond whenever they want, no matter where they are. And social media is like, super popular, so you can connect with people from all over the world. It's like, really cool that you can talk to someone in Japan or something.

But, on the other hand, it's kind of ruined some things. Like, in the workplace, people are always on their phones or computers, so they're not really paying attention to what's going on around them. And on social media, people are always arguing and fighting, so it's like, not a very positive place to be. And sometimes it's hard to have real conversations with people in person because they're always on their phones. It's like, they're not really present in the moment.

I think it's important to be able to communicate with people in person, though. Like, you can't really express yourself fully through a screen. You need to be able to read people's facial expressions and body language and stuff. And it's easier to build deeper connections with people when you're face-to-face.

So, overall, technology has both positive and negative effects on communication and social interaction. It's like, it's a double-edged sword or something. You can use it to connect with people, but you also need to be aware of how it can be negative and make sure you're using it in a way that's healthy for you and your relationships.

I believe that the best cell phone policy is to allow students to have phone in school and allow them to use them during lunch periods and other free periods, so long as the phone are turned off during class time. Cell phones have become a near irreplaceable part of teens' lives today. The ability to be able to contact people at any place and moment in time is extremely important, to the point of being vital. For example, in case of an emergency, students would be able to contact their parents and the other people they would need to inform. Without this luxury- no, necessity- lives could be endangered. Moreover, students would be happier during school because they would be allowed to use their cell phones- at the right time, of course. Thus, students would have a more positive attitude during class, would work harder, and obtain better grades.

Now, i understand why cell phones are generally not accepted in classrooms. cell phones can be distracting in class; you can talk, text message, and IM friends; you can play games or use the internet. With all of the things you can do with that one machine, it's no wonder that cell phones are deemed a distraction in classrooms. However, if cell phones were permitted to be used during lunch periods and other free periods, I assure you that students' cell phones would not be a distraction during class time any longer. If cell phones were allowed to be used in class, the temptation to use them in class would no longer exist. The reason for that is people always want what they can't have. In The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain says that in order to make something desirable to someone, you must make it difficult to obtain. Since it would not be difficult to use cell phones, there would not be a need to have them banned in class- and banning cell phones in class would cause cell phone usage to go up.

I hope that you consider changing the school's cell phone policy to be more lenient about cell phone usage, which would in turn give the school a more student-friendly environment.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
FF21CAA2F125,"You would get a lot of different answers from a lot of peopleif you were to go up to sme and ask them on what they think about the driverless car. But if you were to go and ask me that question i would have to say that I don't think we need to really be focusing on that as much as we should for other thngs in this world, it isnt as safe and could be very dangerous, there isnt anything wrong with having others drive themsleves.

First, I personally believe that there are more serious issues going on in this world that we should be focusing on more and putting more ofthe money twoards that then spending millions trying to get a car to drive by itself. A driverless car is not something we need to be worrying about when we can keep it easy and simple like it has been for many years and just have drivers driving the car.

Secondly, it has yet to been passed by the law due to safety percautions. As of right now the driverless cars are not as safe as a car that has some one driving the vechile. So with that reason whhy there I dont feel like what the need is to try and create something when we are all doing fine and would be doing even better then the driverless car.

Lastly, why fix something if it isnt broken? i get that driverless cars could be helpful for some people at times but to solve that problem that's what taxi's are for. Everythng has been fine with having the people drive the car themselves. People will be more alert then the driverless car itself so it is just best to just keep it as the way it has been going and let the people drive the car themsleves because there isn't anything wrong with doong it like that.

In conclusion, if you were to want to hear my opionin on what I have to say about the driverless cars I would say I think they are neat and could be somethng big in the future to come. As of now though I think that there are bigger things going on in this world right now that we should be focusing on, they are not proven to be as safe then what it is with having someone driving the vechile. And there is not a big problem on having people drive the cars themsleves so there isnt a big need for a solution like this.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
6642E181B08D,"Title: The Importance of Break Time for Students

As an 8th grader, I believe that break time is crucial for students like me. While adults may have more freedom to choose when and how long they take breaks, students have a specific schedule that is designed to help them learn and grow. In this essay, I will research the amount of break time during the school year, compare the advantages and disadvantages of different types of breaks, and analyze why students may plan goals during the summer.

According to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, students typically receive around 100 minutes of break time per day during the school year. This may seem like a lot, but when you consider that school runs from 8am to 3pm, it's actually only about 20% of the school day. In contrast, adults typically have more than twice as much break time as students, with many working full-time jobs that provide longer breaks throughout the day.

Now, let's compare the advantages and disadvantages of different types of breaks. A 3-4 week break in the summer can be great for students who want to relax and recharge after a long school year. It also gives them the opportunity to pursue personal interests or take a trip with their family. However, this long break can also make it harder for students to stay focused and motivated when they return to school.

On the other hand, a longer winter break can be beneficial for students who need a break from the cold weather and the stress of exams. It also gives them more time to spend with their families and friends. However, this longer break can also make it harder for students to stay on track with their schoolwork, especially if they don't have any plans or goals for the time off.

Finally, a week off in spring and fall can be a good compromise between the two. It gives students a short break to recharge and relax, while also allowing them to stay on track with their schoolwork. However, this shorter break may not be enough time for students to pursue their personal interests or take a trip.

So, why do students plan goals during the summer? Many students use this time to get a full-time job or save money for college. Having a job during the summer can help students learn important skills",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

Dear Principal,

I think that community service is good for the students as well as our community. The students should be required to do community service to graduate just not so many hours. I sat this because some of the students also need to do school work, for example some students might need to study for a big test or they might have a lot of homework to do. Some students would love to help but they just might not have enough time in there day. For example lets say that I get home from school at three then I finish my homework at four and finish eating and doing my chores at five thirty then I remember I have a test tomorrow and have to study, I finish studying at six a clock But then I have to take a shower and then walk my dog so I finish at seven and by then it's to dark to do any community service. This is how most kids spend there day at least I do . So you see principal this is why we need to have a limited amount of community service to do. Thank you for reading this letter and I hope you take what I said in consideration.

97CEC5F124E5,"The matter of schools offering online education from home is a widely controversial topic. There are many pros and cons to each option that parents and students may overlook. The difference between distance schooling and on site schooling could change one's future in many ways. Although some may believe it is more beneficial to take online courses from home, on site schooling helps students to develop better social skills and understand material more¬†efficiently than from home all to help develop life skills that cannot be achieved online.

Throughout life, social skills become a big part of the way one operates in reality. Some may say distance classes will help to shield students from factors such as bullying and danger, but they can also take away from the many joys of school such as sports, clubs, and other activities. A student who participates in sports and clubs learns cooperative skills that can be useful in many careers ,where as one who does not may not be such a team player. By preventing students from experiencing these social factors it harms the way they may approach society. Without social skills, kids may become more shy and introverted rather than being more witty and outgoing. For example, a kid who attends a school dance and is apart of clubs or a sports team may become more social than one who stays at home doing nothing. Social skills help to shape ones character and taking that away would not be beneficial to these students or society.

As well as social skills, work efficiency is another big part of the world today. Many may argue that a classroom environment is stressful to students who may learn at a slower pace than others. By taking away personal face to face instruction, it could be seen as eliminating a stress factor in schooling, however, having teachers and peers surrounding each other¬†helps students to push themselves to become better workers. One time I had to stay home from school because I was sick and when I was doing my homework I had questions that I had no one to ask. At home one cannot ask questions or get hands on help from a teacher or other student. Having the help you need in a school environment helps students to become better educated and understanding.

These skills help a person to develop character and personality. One's character can reflect who they will be in the world and what they may do. Life has many obstacles in it but through learning different tools and skills in a classroom life can be effortless. There are milestones that help students to find who they are such as graduating elementary school, taking classes on arts and sciences, team sports and many more. People learn from themselves and others mistakes. Distance schooling keeps kids away from these opportunities to live and learn. On site schooling helps students to develop the knowledge they need to live in the world.

These factors and many more help students to become team players in the world. On site schooling gives students life lessons that can't be taught behind a computer. Along with these lessons are life long memories that give a person character that you can't get behind a computer. Classroom learning is more beneficial to students than distance schooling. Online schooling may seem more efficient to some but learning in a classroom helps to develop well rounded students with good life skills.   ¬† ¬†¬†   ¬† ¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9
llama_70b_v11132,"Gun control is a very sensitive topic in many countries, and it's understandable that people have different opinions on it. In my opinion, stricter gun control laws are necessary to ensure the safety of citizens.

Firstly, the availability of firearms leads to an increase in gun violence. Studies have shown that countries with stricter gun control laws have lower rates of gun violence. For example, in the United States, states with stricter gun control laws have lower rates of gun violence compared to states with more lenient laws. This shows that limiting access to firearms can lead to a reduction in gun violence.

Secondly, stricter gun control laws can prevent mass shootings. Mass shootings have become all too common in many countries, and they often involve the use of assault weapons that are designed for the purpose of killing large numbers of people. If these weapons were not available, it would be much more difficult for individuals to carry out such attacks. For example, in Australia, after a mass shooting in 1996, the government introduced strict gun control laws, and there has not been a single mass shooting since then.

Thirdly, stricter gun control laws can help to reduce suicide rates. Studies have shown that states with stricter gun control laws have lower suicide rates. This is because individuals who are struggling with mental health issues are less likely to have access to firearms, which can be used impulsively in moments of despair.

Finally, stricter gun control laws can help to reduce the number of accidental shootings. Accidental shootings can happen when individuals are not properly trained to handle firearms, or when children accidentally gain access to firearms. By limiting access to firearms and requiring proper training and safety measures, stricter gun control laws can help to prevent such tragedies.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws are necessary to ensure the safety of citizens. They can lead to a reduction in gun violence, mass shootings, suicide rates, and accidental shootings. It's important to note that stricter gun control laws do not mean a complete ban on firearms, but rather a way to ensure that firearms are used responsibly and safely.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The issue of gun control is a highly contentious one in many countries.

7879F32BC3FF,"I want to change the election by popular votes instead of the Electoral College because even if the president gets popular votes, it wouldn't matter anyway. They will have to vote the president by using the Electoral College. It wouldn't be fair because ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" That means if the president gets the most popular votes, it won't matter.

Back then, presidents wouldn't accept the Electoral College. ""What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" They all thought that it wouldn't be fair if the popular votes wouldn't count and the Electoral College has its defenders. The thing that's wrong with the Electoral College is because ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" So if someone were to vote for a president, they would be voting for a slate of the 34 Democratic electors. After that, they pledged it on the president that they voted for.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" It's because of the winner-take-all system that happens also on each state. So candidates think they know they aren't going to win and never spend time on other states as well. People also think that the Electoral College is unfair because they never get to see the candidates and they won't know who they're going to vote. People only relied on Bob Dole. His goal was to ""Abolish the electoral college!""

When people also vote for a presdential canidate they actually vote for the slate of electors. Which was why Gore had more popular votes than Bush, yet he had fewer electoral votes. But there is one way to settle a dispute of the outcome of an Electoral College vote. ""it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The Electoral College also has a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal but has enough electoral votes to vote for president.

So now we all know how the Electoral College is unfair. Because of the constant votes that don't matter at all yet they always make sure to vote that president and all of the popular votes wouldn't matter. That's why I want to change to popular votes than the Electoral College does. All we need to do is work together to over come the Electoral College so the votes can be fair and we would want to vote for the president that we want.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Driverless cars have been in discussion for many years and have been worked on for those many years. Corrperations, such as GM, have developed a system that vibrates the driver seat when the vehicle is in danger of hitting another vihicle while backing up. Other ideas, such as the windshield having flashing lights, have also been discussed. But this is just the beginning of driverless cars. Driverless cars should not yet be implied in today's society due to lack of technology developement.

Driverless cars cannot be released into the world because of lack in testing the cars to see if they function correctly. Many states have made laws that provent companies from testing these cars due to safety laws. Another point to look at is how much the driver would actually pay attention if they have a driverless car. If one is behind the wheel of a driverless car, they would not want to operate, but rather do something of importance to themself. If the driverless car is put out there, the driver would not want to have to take over, which they would have to at some points of the journey. Most laws are made to provide safety for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. If the technology and functions behind the driverless car fail and cause injury, whose to say is at fault? The driver or the technology could both be at fault for causing injury. Of course driverless cars would be convenient and better for gas usage, but our technology is not developed enough to pursue driverless cars.

Although driverless cars have been in discussion and worked on for many years, we are not yet ready as a society to begin the idea of letting them on roads. Because of lack in technology developement, safety, lack of testing, and the careless drivers who would be behind the wheel, our society is not ready for this function to be on the road.

9DCB91B1F18D,"One of the greatest educational benefits of taking an art, music, or drama class as an elective in school is the development of creativity. By engaging in creative activities such as painting, writing music, or performing on stage, students acquire skills that go beyond the traditional academic curriculum and can help them become more creative thinkers. Additionally, taking art, music, and drama classes can help improve a student's academic performance, as research has shown that students who participate in creative activities tend to score higher on tests, think more critically, and have better problem solving skills.

In addition to academic performance, taking art, music, and drama classes can provide students with practical skills and knowledge that are beneficial for college and career prospects. Knowledge learned in these classes such as how to read and interpret music, create and understand art, and perform and interpret a dramatic script can be useful for college and job applications. Furthermore, collaborative activities such as ensemble performance and group theatres can help students gain important interpersonal skills such as teamwork and leadership that are beneficial for college and professional endeavors.

By taking art, music, and drama classes, students can gain an in-depth understanding of the various aspects of these creative pursuits. This knowledge can be applied to various aspects of their lives, such as studying, developing creativity, and providing them with the opportunity to pursue their interests in a safe, structured environment.

Generic_Name is a young adult who was struggling to make important decisions about their future. They were unsure about what college to attend, what major to pursue, and what career path to take. They felt overwhelmed and uncertain, and they didn't know where to turn for help.

One day, Generic_Name decided to seek guidance from a career counselor at their high school. The counselor took the time to get to know Generic_Name, understand their interests and strengths, and provide personalized advice on how to navigate their future.

Thanks to the guidance of the career counselor, Generic_Name was able to make informed decisions about their future. They ended up attending a top university, majoring in a field they were passionate about, and landing a dream job right out of college.

The benefits of seeking guidance from experts and authorities are numerous. First and foremost, it can help you make informed decisions. When you're unsure about something, it's easy to make decisions based on fear or uncertainty rather than logic and reason. Seeking guidance from an expert can help you see things from a different perspective and make more informed decisions.

Second, seeking guidance can help you save time and avoid mistakes. When you're not sure about something, it's easy to waste time trying different things and making mistakes along the way. Seeking guidance from an expert can help you avoid these mistakes and get on the right path more quickly.

falcon_180b_v1_547,"Yes, I believe that students can greatly benefit from the option of distance learning or attending classes from home. With the advancement of technology, students have the convenience of being able to access lectures and course materials from virtually anywhere. This allows students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which is particularly helpful if they have other commitments such as jobs or caring for family members.

Furthermore, attending classes from home can reduce the amount of stress and anxiety that students may experience in a traditional classroom setting. Some students may feel more comfortable asking questions in a virtual environment, and they may feel less self-conscious about participating in discussions when they are not face-to-face with their peers.

Additionally, distance learning offers an opportunity for students who may not have access to traditional schooling due to distance, disability or illness to receive a quality education. It provides a way for them to participate in classes and receive an education without having to leave their homes or communities. This is particularly important in rural or isolated areas where access to education may be limited.

However, it is important to note that while distance learning has many advantages, it also has its challenges. Students may need to possess strong time-management and self-discipline skills in order to successfully complete coursework on their own. Additionally, there may be technical challenges or issues with connectivity that could impact a student's ability to participate in virtual classes.

In conclusion, I believe that offering distance learning as an option for students is a positive step in providing access to education for a broader range of students. It can offer flexibility, reduce stress, and provide education to those who may not otherwise have access to it.

You are changing the school policy so students have to have a grade B average in order to participate in after school sports or other activities. This will not allow people to interact with others, get in exercise, or have any free time from school. What your doing is a bad idea.

How do you expect students to interact with others if they have no where to go after school? If this happens students will loose friends or not see them as often. Students would struggle in school because they would no one encouraging them to do better. Having friends in and out of school is very important.

Another reason is we would loose exercise because we would have no where to go. After school sports and activities are helpful because it allows students to stay in shape and stay healthy. They would have to stay at home doing homework and trying to get there grades up. This means they will start gaining weight and eating more.

Having free time from school is very helpful. It relieves a lot of stress and allows you to get school off your mind. Free time lets you hang out with friends and family. Also it allows you to go outside and be interactive, and healthy. If you have to worry about grades all the time you become stressed out and up tight. Sports allows you to let out all of those things.

C266F2FBD7CC,"Dear Principal,

The following change in the school policy, in my opinion would be a positive change. Although the majority of the students have a C average, a required B to be in after school activities would make more sense.

Truthfully , if a student really wanted to participate in an after school activity they would keep there grade up to the appropriate standard. I mean sports shouldn't take away from a students education, a high academic grade should be a students main priority. Plus if the parent or legal guardian found out his or her child wasn't passing at a proper grade average , they will complain to the school board on how their child isn't getting the ""proper learning skills"" they need, when more then likely the student being to occupied with after school activities or other things.

Even though automatically taking the kid out of the team or club he or she is participated in is an option there are other options the school can use as well. Teachers can give the student make-up work to bump up there grade, the school can hold an after school intervention to give students the extra help they need in the first place, or the councilor can call the specific student into their office and give them a warning of what could happen in the future if they don't work harder in school or just straight up ask ""why are your grades so low?"" , and move on from there. Plus the student isn't necessarily getting low grades because of sports, the sports issue is just the conclusion a lot of people jump to. What if the student is having family problems , or what if the student is getting bullied, or other things outside of school , or they just don't understand that a certain subject, maybe he or she is just to lazy to the homework in the first place , there are a million reasons why someone would be to busy or non-focused on homework or class work.

In conclusion , having a B average would be a appropriate change in the school policy , but before just booting the student out of his or her after school club or activity , try and get down to the main point of why he or she isn't focused on there education. Thank-you for taking your own time for reading this, and I hope you take this under consideration. I like to know their opinion is taken under consideration.

Working in a group can be advantageous in that it allows for more ideas to come together, leading to positive outcomes.

However, there are also some potential disadvantages to working in a group, such as personality clashes and arguments. These issues can lead to tensions among the group members and potentially impede progress.

521E1917490F,"The Vaule or No Vaule in the Facial Coding System

What is the point in the facial coding system? If you think about it what can it be used for in our daily lives. Or what affect does it have towards us if we use it today. The facial action coding system is a new software thats developed to improve accuaracy in perceiving the emotons of others. Although, it seems that it might have a value, but in reality it does not because three reaosn on why it's not vauleable is because money is being wasted towards an invention that will not be used, if they are trying to hide their emotions what is the point in making it if they do not want to show them for a reson so they should not be forced to use it, and how can you porve it is accurate how would you ever know if that is really how you feel when it shows you because your the only one that knows how you really feel.

First reason on why its not vauleable is because money is going to be wasted toward something that will not be used in future. Instead of using money on things like this sytem and adding more unuseful things on this world.

Maybe we should invest on a invetion that would be an affect in our lives and would benifit us in a postive way. Yeah it may be cool to mess around with a system like this for fun but using the money wisely is better on using it on soemthing that is not uselful. For an example making or putting in moremoeny to help get more supplies to discover more ways in finding a cure for cancer.

A second reason on why its not vauleable is because if someone is trying to hide their emotions its for a reason. Why should soemone be forced to use this sytem when they do not want to express how they feel. Most of the time poeple do not show on how they feel towards things that they do not show no face expessions. But on the other hand if you are in a good mood I would understand on why you would want to try it. But if you are in a situation that is putting you down but not wantng to express it. Then why make it harder on them and make them feel even worse because their emotions are being out there and seen by others when that is what they do not want.

A the third reason on why its not vauleable is because how can you prove it is accurate. How would you ever know if that is really how you feel when it shows you because your the only one that knows how you really feel. Yeah it may take the 44 major muscles in your face and recognize an expression. But is it really accurate? There really is not a percentage of feelings you can have. It is just how you feel. A machine should not be telling you that you feel 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 pecent fearful, and 2 percent angry. You should just be able to determine yourself and express or know how you feel cause they are your own emotions. You do not need the facial coding system to tell you.

What is the point in the facial coding system? The system does not have an affect on us that would be valueable. Although, it seems that it might have a value, but in reality it does not because three reaosn on why it's not vauleable is because money is being wasted towards an invention that will not be used, if they are trying to hide their emotions what is the point in making it if they do not want to show them for a reson so they should not be forced to use it, and how can you porve it is accurate how would you ever know if that is really how you feel when it shows you because your the only one that knows how you really feel.

3215F95D4312,"Dear Principal,

I have heard of the two policies you have been considering, regarding cell phones in school. I just wanted to share with you my perspective about this situation. I believe that you should select policy number one. You want the children to look forward to coming to school, instead of feeling like they are forced to go someplace they dislike. Giving the students the right to use cell phones during lunch periods and other free times will give them the personality that you long to see. Also, if the students want to come to school more often that will have a huge affect on Count Day. If cell phones are used during these free times, i don't really think there will be a disturbance to other students/staff members.

Another, If students from other schools discover the new policy at our school district, they will want to transfer to the district to have these rights. Cell phones have been banned from schools for as long as i can remember; they should experiment with something new, since many generations are passing up the opportunity to still be in school, and just say, ""I never wanted to go to school, but I finished.""

The only thing is that I don't know what the parents of the children would say. Some might agree with the idea and won't mind their kids using cell phones in school, but some might disagree and want their kids to not be distracted during school, and to just learn the curriculum that the school has to offer. Many people are going to have different opinions, so the best thing to do is to take a poll for this matter. A poll where students and parents vote for what they believe should happen with this whole cell phone policy.

Therefore, my opinion is to choose policy one, where kids can use cell phones during free time. Let the students have some fun. But, it's your decision, you're the principal of this school, not me. Thank you for your time. Have a nice day!

ACA08DBF39EE,"As an eighth-grade student, I have experienced both distance learning and in-person classes. While both methods have their advantages, I believe that attending classes in person is more effective for students. In this essay, I will analyze the benefits and drawbacks of attending classes from home versus attending in person, compare and contrast the effectiveness of learning from home versus in a traditional school setting, discuss the opinion of parents about distance learning, and provide an argument about why distance learning may not be the best option for students.

One of the main benefits of attending classes from home is flexibility. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is especially beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as sports or part-time jobs. Additionally, students can learn in a comfortable and familiar environment, which can lead to increased productivity and motivation.

However, there are also several drawbacks to attending classes from home. One of the main drawbacks is the lack of social interaction. In a traditional school setting, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers on a daily basis. This social interaction is essential for the development of social skills and the formation of meaningful relationships.

Another drawback of distance learning is the potential for distractions. When students are learning from home, they may be more likely to get distracted by social media, video games, or other activities. This can lead to decreased productivity and a lack of focus on the material.

In contrast, attending classes in person has several benefits. Firstly, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers on a daily basis. This social interaction is essential for the development of social skills and the formation of meaningful relationships. Additionally, attending classes in person provides a structured learning environment that can help students stay focused and motivated.

However, there are also some drawbacks to attending classes in person. One of the main drawbacks is the potential for illness. When students are in a classroom setting, they are more likely to come into contact with germs and viruses. This can lead to the spread of illness and can be a concern for both students and teachers.

In my opinion, attending classes in person is more effective for students than attending from home. While distance learning has its advantages, it lacks the social interaction and structured learning environment that is essential for the development of social skills and the formation of meaningful relationships. Additionally, attending classes",1,llammistral7binstruct,,9
8A0A3FE01FE7,"It is widely accepted that both physical and online learning in the classroom setting have their own advantages and disadvantages. Physical learning gives students the opportunity to actively engage in classroom discussions, form relationships, collaborate, and foster strong connections with their peers and teachers. On the other hand, online learning allows students to access a wider range of materials and resources and is often more convenient for students with difficulty attending traditional classes. 

When comparing the pros and cons of traditional classroom learning and distance learning, both have strengths and drawbacks. Traditional classroom learning allows for a hands-on approach and face-to-face student interaction, while distance learning allows for more independence and tailor-made learning programs. However, distance learning can also be hindered by technological issues and students may feel isolated from their peers. 

The potential difficulties faced with online or video conferencing may include difficulty connecting, slow connection speeds, difficulties using the necessary programs, and additional time needed for preparation. Solutions include planning ahead, using video conferencing tools designed for instruction, testing tools ahead of time, and scheduling regular check-ins with students. 

It is important to involve students in discussions about their experiences and views on distance learning. Invite students to share their stories and perspectives, and ask them to think of potential ways to become more focused and productive within distance learning. This give students an opportunity to gain a better understanding of how to successfully benefit from virtual learning.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

87C7180CD212,"People in a everyday normal life have a question to ask there not unsure about. So they ask people if they agree with what there saying or if they disagree. I do agree that you should ask more then one person for multiple opinions and for a better response. Also some people only ask one person for an answer which is not the best thing to do because one opinion is not as good as multiple opinions. Talking to more people for more opinions on your question gives you a much more diverse answer.

If someone ask people for advice, they would most likely ask more then one person which is a really good idea. Asking multiple people for advice gives you a much more better response and much more opinions which is really good advice. If you ask one person for advice there going to say either yes or no, which is not horrible but if you ask like 10 different people they are all going to give you there opinions on what they think and then from there you guys can narrow it down to the best possible answer. Also asking multiple people allows you to do better choices for yourself. Overall seeking for multiple opinions is a better choice and would give you better advice.

Asking multiple people for advice gives you a better response because you are going to have more then one person asking you what they think you should do. You should always try to search for the best advice you can get because it gives you more ideas. The more and more people you ask the better advice your going to get but you don't want to ask to much people because it could get out of hand. If you ask only one person for advice they could give you good advice that could help you, but it also really depends on the person. But it always so much better to ask multiple people because it helps you out more.

You can also tell the difference between asking one person or multiple people for advice. If you ever wanted really good advice you should ask more then one person. Also seeking multiple opinions could make your life so much easier because it lets you do better choices. Overall you should be asking more then one person because it allows you to do better choices for yourself.

5BE09FA95B04,"CELL PHONES: The Killer Distraction

We live in a technical world, where cell phones are required accessories. Much like shoes, handbags, and clothes. If you're a technology geek you crave for the latest iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. Landline what is that? Extinct like the dinosaurs.

Cell Phones while a necessity for most are dangerous while driving. And have caused major accidents, some ending in death. That's why I refer to them as the killer distraction. Today's society is like a microwave. We want everything instant and ready to go. Most of us are always on the go and not without our cell phones. We can't seem to function without them. It is a mini computer in hand. But why we can't seem to stay off of them long enough while driving?

Have you ever been driving, and another driver almost swerved into hitting you? Then you notice they're on their phone? You get so mad you want to chase them down. I had a friend who was on her cell phone while driving, drop it and end up hitting a fire hydrant. Now what if she had hit a person? She was ok that could have ended in a tragedy for herself or someone else.

Should drivers be able to use cell phones while driving? I have mixed views on that. Cell phones are convenient in many ways. They have GPS to help navigate to desired destinations. Many of us would be lost without it. While driving you might receive an important call. But you can put it on speaker. Most of the newer cars have Bluetooth Speaker and you don't have to hold the phone. In my opinion that's safer, then phone in hand and the other on the wheel.

Now on the other hand. Cell phones are the cause of many accidents which a even fatal . Distractions such as taking eyes the road just for a split second to send a text or to dial a number, can result in a accident. Having a heated argument or getting bad news while driving, can be a distraction a cause an accident. Trying to work GPS can be a distraction that could cause an accident. According to the internet there are 1.6 million crashes a year. 390,000 caused by texting and driving. It said that texting causes more accidents than drunk driving. Now that's serious and should be a wake up call. 21 percent of teen drivers involved in a fatal accident we're distracted from their cell phones.

Due to the rising numbers in call accident regarding cell phones, most states ban the use of cell phone in hand, while driving. Cell phones is a killer distraction. And not safe to use while driving. Unless you're using your car's Bluetooth Speaker for hand free conversation. And that should be limited because it's still easy to get distracted. While driving we need to be focus on the road and our safety, and those around us. If you must make a call please use Bluetooth or even pull over. Texting while driving is dangerous and unacceptable. Let's not be the cause of another unnecessary accident.

D447CD5A0C67,"Americans throughout the country believe that the Electoral College isn't fair and believe that they deserve a more direct voting syste to the president, other than voting for electors. These reasons are made by the people because they want more and more power in the government. What the people want is almost always the risky option, especially when the topic is government. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept as the way it is now, and not a direct voting system for American citizens.

As said in the previous statement, Americans that want the Electoral College gone are lurking for more power when it comes to rules. Unfortunately, if the government's decisions were left in the hands of the people, the country's state would be in anarchy. On the other hand, the electoral college offers Congress and the Senate a share of the power, and the American citizens a share of the power as well. For example, if the Electoral College began to diminish, then became wiped out immediately, the government could do nothing less but to watch as the people choose the president that they want. Sometimes, what is wanted by the people may not always be the right thing.

Moving on, almost 60 percent of all American voters stated that they would rather have a direct voting system, putting aside the Electoral College. What most people are not seeing is that the direct voting and Electoral College system are very similar. The difference between the two is, that when Americans vote in the Electoral College, they are voting for electors that go towards the president, and when Americans vote directly to the president, those same amount of votes go to the president as well. If the voting system was based off of a direct route to the presidents side, then there would be too many votes to count, which is why have representatives towards each state is one of the glories of the Electoral College.

Finally, the popular voting system is very flawed, considering that there are states that have millions more people people than others. Some states even double the size of other states according to population. For example, New York's population most likely doubles the population of Florida's, but thanks to the Electoral College, the representative and population ratio weighs out, giving each state an equal amount of votes toward their president. Now, if the popular voting system was in place, then states like New York would outnumber states like Florida's votes by millions. It would not be as fair as it is now if the popular voting system replaced the Electoral College.

In conclusion, the Electoral Colllege has many positive outlooks like keeping the voting system fair and not giving too much power to either side when voting is the subject. Although many Americans believe that the Elecotral College is causing the wrong presidents to win, it does not make a difference either way because of the way that the Electoral College evens out the votes. The Electoral College is a fair and suitable system for the United States and should be kept as America's voting system be       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
5a245572,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities alike. It not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also promotes healthier lifestyles and more sustainable communities. The passage set provides several examples of how limiting car usage has been successfully implemented in different parts of the world and the positive outcomes that have resulted from it.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a large portion of these emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can lower these emissions and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage promotes healthier lifestyles. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have given up their cars and rely on alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. This not only eliminates the stress associated with car ownership but also encourages physical activity, leading to improved health and well-being. As one resident mentioned, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This demonstrates the positive impact of limiting car usage on both mental and physical health.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more sustainable and accessible communities. The concept of ""smart planning"" mentioned in the passage set focuses on separating suburban life from auto use. This includes placing stores within walking distance on main streets instead of distant malls, as seen in Vauban. By doing so, communities become more compact and accessible to public transportation, reducing the need for cars and creating a more sustainable living environment.

In addition, limiting car usage can alleviate traffic congestion and improve air quality in urban areas. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. The ban also had exceptions for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars with three or more passengers, encouraging the use of more eco-friendly transportation options. This example shows how limiting car usage can have immediate and positive effects on air quality and traffic flow.

Furthermore, the passage set highlights the trend of decreasing car ownership and driving in the United States. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This cultural shift not only has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment but also challenges the traditional car industry. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies, recognizing the need to adapt to changing consumer behavior.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of healthier lifestyles, creation of sustainable communities, alleviation of traffic congestion, and improvement of air quality. The passage set provides examples of successful implementations of car-free initiatives in different parts of the world and the positive outcomes that have resulted from them. As we continue to prioritize sustainable living, limiting car usage should be an integral part of our efforts to create a greener and more sustainable future.",1,radek_500,,3
d851fa71,"The Electoral College is full of debates, but the biggest debate is if they should still have power. They should not stay in power because The United States of America is a democracy. Its is easier and more democratic if the candidate won by popular demand. What is a democracy good for if the Electoral college can change their choice of who becomes president. Many of the representatives in the Electoral College are unfair to voters and sometimes cheat the voting system. Would you want that running your countries choices? I dont think so.

The voters choose a candidate in the electoral college but they can always change their votes. For example, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" stated in source two. Basically, If you want a republican president to win you would vote for a republican representative of the electoral college, but thats not always the truth. Voters can not control the mind of a representative, in a few seconds they become of member of the opposing sides and thus they have your vote. This is known as unfair use of your vote that can obviously not be taken back.

2000 was the the year many people realized the lies of the electoral college. Bradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Electoral College states that ""Al Gore... won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" This means that the electoral college is cheating the voting system and lying to their voters. So, do your votes even matter? No, not really. ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" said by Plumer. This system we have for voting is basically useless to us and just gives the electoral college more power to run us.

The Electoral College does have some good reasons its still in power. In source three written by Richard A. Posner, he states that ""... the pressure of the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner."" In other words, when there is a runoff election or tie, the electoral college brings down this pressure making the choice so its quicker to make a choice on who becomes president. Sadly, very few people find the Electoral College useful but they do do a lot of things that help make the elections easier on the voters and putting less pressure on the candidates.

In the past few years people have realized what the Electoral College actually does. Its is true to believe that they grab our vote and change it last minute. They also can help in the process of the presidential election, but they make the voters confused and get called unfair adn cheaters, which is true. If this country was truely a democracy then the people would have complete ownership on who becomes president not the Electoral College.",0,train_essays,,9
A91E59572DA0,"Technology had been a useful tool for the man to make his life easier. Cellphones, smart watches, and more make information very accesible and easy to find. But technology also has a negative impact on social relations, as it reduces human contact and promotes lazyness. The main target is the youth, which is more exposed to technologycal advanced nowadays.

When we think about technology, social media comes related too. For some, especially teenagers, these websites work as entertaining platforms, useful to share memories and talk with friends and new people. While these can make contact easier, the risks become higher when social media is not used properly. Posting personal information, such as your adress, cellphone, or location, is an irresponsible action which could lead to unsafe situations. Websites like Facebook and Instagram make identity theft easier: as they reduce human contact, people can take advantage of the users by introducing themselves first as a 'new friend,' to then execute their real intentions. For instance, kidnap and monetary robbery are the most popular cases that come out of social media.

In addition, social wesites and items like phones can be utilized in the way. There have been lately a lot of users claiming that their phones are listening at all moment, a tactic which could be useful to spy on people. As this theory has not been confirmed yet, it could be easily enforced by anyone with the required knowledge.

Productivity is another factor influenced by technology. The main purpose of most technological items is to make our lives easier and, in some cases like hardwork larbor, it can be very efficient. But when people start spending hours with these objects, the development of dependency towards technology could increase. Video games, for instance, have become the addiction of many kids, who stop performing their typical responsibilities in order to play with these. This is another way human contact is reduced, which will have a significant impact in their future lives. To develop social skills at a young age is very important for kids to succeed in the future. It's true that many factors affect the achievement of succeess and it can not be predicted by the skills a person has; but what it's true is that we are always going to be exposed to social interactions and it's neccessary to learn how to manage them.

A solution for this problem could be in the parents' hands. Enforcing limitations on the use of technology not only will create a stronger relationship between them and the children but it will be beneficial for the kid's future.

After all, technology has become a advantage for many of us in our daily life. However, it's important to stay aware about its risks and exercise a responsible behavior when using it. Moreover, we shouldn't let it take total control of our actions and enjoy in-person relations more.",0,original_moth,"Task:

57C5D1B5D26B,"What if out of the nowhere a person had to go out of their way to do something that wasn't needed? Wouldn't they be outraged and confused being forced into something that they know isn't necessary? So if this was implemented on a full scale of students wouldn't it fall apart completely. Knowing that the rule that would force students to do extracurricular activities could end up hurting the children and damaging the school, shouldn't it go away.

A school should support helping kids make their own decisions, but if they force them to make one it only hurts them and their growth. When someone constantly holds your hand and guides you to a choice it isn't possible to grow and learn. If they choose to hold their students hands throughout their schooling, how will they be able to grow and progress. If the children are forced into certain activities they won't be able to learn for themselves and become dependent on others. This can be shown in some schools were students pay others to write essay's for them but then fail their tests because nobody could help them. Also, it could ruin several students ability to manage their time if the principal forces them toward a activity. If a student who has a busy life gets more pressure on them they may give up on their grades. If they aren't able to manage their time on top of the activity, they won't be able to excel like how schools wants the students to. An example of this can be seen anywhere because if too much pressure is put on anyone they can get anxiety or depression from the stress. Lastly, it gives more stress on certain students because of the unfamiliar environment. If a child who is bad at interacting with others is forced to spend an upwards of 30 minutes or more a day alone with others it could make them anxious and scared. It would throw students into an unfamiliar place where they don't know anyone and don't even like the activity. This is shown in things like graduation or going to a new school, because teenagers may feel overwhelmed or stressed by the changes in environment. With all the damage the new rule would cause why let it stay in the education system.

It would change the school in many bad ways if this rule was allowed, which is why it can't be allowed to exist in our education. If the rule stays more money will have to go to clubs and activities then usually resulting in lower funds. A decrease in funds will happen since they need to buy more equipment for all clubs like volleyball. With more funds going to clubs it will be harder to improve the building itself and if any damage happens it may not be fixable. Which, is shown in modern capitalism where in order to expand you need to spend more money.¬†Next, it will affect support given to the school. This will happen because if their kids are made to do something that affects them mentally in a bad way their parents will outrage. They would start losing students because the parents wouldn't support the school. This can be shown with things like the corona virus¬†where people started to leave their countries after learning it was unsafe for their families. Last of all, it could affect the sponsors they get. This would happen because the school could start losing parents and kids which would affect how much money they get from sponsors and parents. Sponsors would leave because they no longer think that the school is worth their money since they are losing children and their parents. This can be shown in the stock market, where when funds are in a certain business and the value is going down the sponsors sell their stocks and leave. This would overall permanently damage the school if these events happened, which shows that this policy needs to be rid of.

It is only a waste to make that policy because it ends up hurting the kids and the school. There is no point in keeping this rule if it is just going to hurt everyone around it. So, if this school really cares about itself and its students it should let this activity law be abolished.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Places like Germany, Paris, and Bogota have banned the usage of cars. They say that since they have did that congestion in the cities have gone down. Polluted cities aren't as crowded as they use to since they have banned the usage of cars.

Vauban, Germany is one of the places that has banned the usage of cars. You can still own a car but there are only two places to park your car, large garages at the end of a development or buy a psace along with a home. In article one it stated that,¬† ""More than 70 percent of Vauban's familis do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here,"" People siad that having a car was tense and kind of too much pressure when in a crowded city. In 2006 Vauban had become an example of¬† a growing trend in Europe. Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a square mile, they have been the most advanced experiment in low car usage. Stores are placed on the walk away or on a main street, rather than in malls or on a distant highway.

Paris have a near-record pollution so they enfroced a partial drivning ban the clear some of the air in the global city. Motorists with even and odd-numbered license plates were ordered to leave thier cars at home or they suffer and fine of 22-euros. Around 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty-sevn people had thier cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. Congestion was down nearly 60 percent in the capital of France after five days after the enforement of the driving fine. SInce Paris has generally more smog than other European capitals diesel fueal was blamed for it. Diesel fuel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. Delivery companies complained about the lost of revenue for cars. In aritcle two it siad, ""Public transportation was free of charge from Friday to Monday,"" the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for odd-numbered car plates on Tuesday.

Bogota, Columbia have banned usage of cars for three years straight. Cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day. Thier goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Anybody that violated that suffered a fine of $25 dollars. Aritcle 3 buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It;s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" meaning that cutting down car usage with lower the greenhouse gases in the air and clear it up. Dyas without cars is a part of a improvement capaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s, it has been the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Parks and sport centers and have bulid throughout the city. Pitted sidewalks have been replaced with smooth sidewalks, rush-hour restirctions have cut traffic dramatically, new resturants and upscale shopping ditstricts have cropped up. Bannig cars in Bogota has been the best thing that has ever happened to the city.

In 2013, President Obama had ambitious goals to curb the United States's greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies have shown that many Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years go by. In article 4 it said that ""as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995,"" part of that is because many Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. Demographic shifts in the driving population have made the trend of banning car accelerate.

In conclusion, banning cars will a successful rate on not just the United States but the world. Maybe people should actually look and promote the idea to see if it will help our economy and or environment. Without cars polluted cities will be able to breath fresh air and won't have to worry about payign for gas. Banning cars could be the best thing that will happen to the world.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
A46DA0EA4F5D,"Advantages and Disadvantages of Four-Day School Weeks

In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards four-day school weeks. While proponents of this idea argue that it has numerous benefits, others believe that it will have negative consequences. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of a four-day school week, and discuss potential solutions to any potential problems that may arise.

One of the main advantages of a four-day school week is that it would give students more time for extracurricular activities. With an extra day off each week, students would have more time to participate in sports, music, clubs, and other activities that they enjoy. This could lead to increased engagement and motivation, as students would have more opportunities to pursue their passions outside of the classroom.

Another advantage of a four-day school week is that it would give teachers more time to plan and prepare for their lessons. With an extra day off each week, teachers would have more time to collaborate with their colleagues, reflect on their teaching practices, and develop new strategies for engaging students. This could lead to more effective teaching and better student outcomes.

However, there are also potential disadvantages to a four-day school week. One of the main concerns is that it could negatively impact student learning. With fewer days in the school week, teachers would have less time to cover all of the material they need to teach. This could lead to rushed lessons, inadequate instruction, and a decrease in the quality of education.

Another potential disadvantage of a four-day school week is that it could put additional stress on parents. With their children out of school for an extra day each week, parents would need to find alternative childcare arrangements. This could be difficult and expensive, and could put additional strain on working parents.

To address these potential disadvantages, schools could implement a number of solutions. For example, they could reduce the amount of homework assigned to students, or they could provide additional resources and support for parents to help them find childcare. Additionally, schools could work to ensure that teachers have the time and resources they need to plan and prepare for their lessons, even with a shorter school week.

In conclusion, a four-day school week has both advantages and disadvantages. While it could give students more time for extracurric",1,llammistral7binstruct,,9
falcon_180b_v1_259,"I believe summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed. This is because it allows students to take ownership of their learning and pursue their own interests. If a student is passionate about a topic, they are more likely to engage with the material and produce a higher quality project.

For example, I know of a student who was really interested in environmental issues. Instead of being given a generic assignment by their teacher, they designed their own project that involved researching the impact of single-use plastics on the environment and finding ways to reduce their own plastic usage. This project was more meaningful and engaging for the student because it was based on their own interests.

Additionally, student-designed projects can foster creativity and critical thinking skills. By allowing students to come up with their own project ideas, they are encouraged to think outside the box and find unique solutions to problems. This can lead to more innovative and original projects that truly showcase a student's abilities.

On the other hand, teacher-designed projects can be limiting and may not align with a student's interests or abilities. While teachers may have their students' best interests at heart, they cannot truly understand every individual's passions and strengths. As a result, a teacher-designed project may not be as effective in promoting learning and growth.

In conclusion, I believe that summer projects should be left up to the students to design. This allows for more personalized and engaging projects that truly reflect the interests and abilities of each individual student. While teacher guidance and input can be helpful, the ultimate decision should lie with the student in order to foster ownership and creativity.",1,falcon_180b_v1,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

CE246FE2471F,"Hey, guys! Today in class, we were talking about how positivity can lead to success in life. I think it's super important to have a positive attitude and surround yourself with positive people. When you're around people who are all smiles and happy, it's contagious! You start to feel good too and it makes you want to be a better person.

I know some people might be like, ""But what about when things get tough? How can you stay positive then?"" And honestly, it's not always easy. But the thing is, when you have a positive mindset, you're more likely to find solutions to problems instead of getting bogged down by them. Like, if you're trying out for the soccer team and you don't make it, you could get super bummed out and give up. Or, you could be like, ""Okay, I didn't get picked for the team this time, but I'm gonna work even harder next year!"" See what I mean?

And it's not just about sports. When you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to take risks and try new things. Like, if you want to start a club at school, you might be like, ""I don't know if anyone will join,"" but if you have a positive mindset, you're more likely to go for it and make it happen!

And let's not forget about music! Listening to positive songs can totally change your mood and make you feel more energized and motivated. I know sometimes I'll be feeling down and then I'll listen to like, a super upbeat pop song and I'm like, ""Woah, I'm feeling so much better now!"" It's crazy how music can affect you like that!

So yeah, incorporating positivity into your life can lead to success in so many ways. It's not always easy, but it's totally worth it. And who knows, maybe one day you'll be like, ""Hey, I started a successful business because I was positive and motivated!"" üí∞üí°

Anyway, that's my take on it. What do you guys think?

And everyone is in uproar about how do we stop all this stuff from happening well it could as simple as using cars less often. This maybe sound shocking to most people who drive but maybe if we use our cars less there would be less accidents or drunk driving and not to mention less greenhouse gasses. Did you know that 50% of greenhouse gas comes from cars in car-intesive areas in the United States. Thats right 50% of those greenhouse gasses come for your car. I'm not saying we should stop driving cars in general but make an effort to use them less. Like in Bogota Columbia they have a day dedicated to not driving cars and instead using public trainsportation. From doing this they improved there sidewalks, reduced traffic and even upscale restaurants and shopping centers sprouted up. And every year everyone is happy and very ethustiastic about the day.

08CE03D82736,"Most of the time when a student comes back from school they go home and relax, procrastinate and maybe do their homework; this is most students, but not all. Extracurricular activities can either be fun and exhilirating or dull and exhausting; it all depends on what the student enjoys doing. If a student loves to move around all the time, they don't want to just sit around and do nothing. Student's that enjoy wasting¬†thier time doing unnecesary things, suffer from it. If someone was to be placed with their friends doing something that they usually wouldn't do, they would do it, because that is the influence your friends have on you. If your friends like to skip class, you are eventually going to skip class. If your friends are excellent in school, you will be excellent in school. I agree with making sure everyone has atleast one extracurricular activity because it would help students do something productive instead of wasting their time doing nothing; it would give students motivation to stop procrastinating and finish their work on time. Colleges also look at your extracurricular activities so it would definitely help the student trying to get into college. I also believe that this will be good for some of the students with mental health issues and it could reduce stress.

Extracurricular activities would help students do something productive, instead of wasting their time by making sure that they alsways keep themselves busy and get them to understand that you can never get time back, once it's gone, it's never coming back, so they should do something productive with it that will help them in the future. Hopefully they can teach those students, to do something now, that your future self will thank you for. Extracurricular activities can help students overcome their struggles, for example; if a student who procrastinates took joined a club for time management they would learn ways to finish their work on time and not worry about overdue assignments. In order for students to succeed in school and be succesfull in the future, there are certain obstacles they must overcome in order to succeed; hopefully extracurricular activities can do just that.

For the students trying their hardest to get into college, your GPA and SAT scores are not the only thing Colleges look at. Colleges and Universities want to see the kind of person you are, otherwise we're all just numbers; what that means is, if Colleges see that someone was on the student council or was the president of their club, they are going to be impressed by it, because it shows that that person has leadership skills, and colleges need leaders, not followers. There has been numerous occasions when an average studeent that participated in activities got accepted by their dream college as opposed to an excellent student that never participated in activities and got declined by the college they applied to; why? Because colleges can't see the type of person you are and what skills you possess based off of test scores and how well you did on an assignment, a letter does not define you. Just because someone did well on a test than another doesn't mean they are better than the other. The way the schooling system works is like a puzzle some students fit in that puzzle, others don't.

Extracurricular activities with friends is fun and exhilirating; your friends make you laugh and make you happy, happiness releases dopamines to your brain that that puts you in a wonderfull mood. However not everyone has friends and not everyone has social skills. Those that are socially akward, can create a club and learn how to talk to poeple so they can make friends. Clubs, and sports are all extracurricular activities that involve others and the more you hang around a person the more comfortable you are around them the easier it is to talk to them and become friends . People will mental health issues or have stress from school can go to their extracurricular activity to relax and have a good time. As it states in paragraph two, extracurricular activities helps people finish their work so they don't have to stress about it therefor reducing stress levels., dopamines reduce depression and anxiety; furthermore mental health issues don't become as big as an issue as it was before.

I agree with making sure everyone has atleast one extracurricular activity because it would help students do something productive instead of wasting their time doing nothing; it would give students motivation to stop procrastinating and finish their work on time. Colleges also look at your extracurricular activities so it would definitely help the student trying to get into college.

I also believe that this will be good for some of the students with mental health issues, it could also reduce stress. Student's that procrastinate and waste their time, have friends that do the same. They can meet new people with better habbits and join clubs to help overcome that so they can better their performance in school. Hopefully they can teach those students to do something now, your future self will thank you for. As for Colleges, they want to see personality, otherwise we're all just numbers, and colleges don't want numbers they want bright people. If you show leadership skills in clubs or sports, colleges will be impressed by it, because colleges need leaders, not followers. As for mental health, friends make you laugh and make you happy, feeling happy releases dopamines to your brain that that puts you in a great mood.

EDD899D4131D,"Generic_Name thinks the school should control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Students are in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences. Some people think schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities because they would know if the students grades are good enough to enroll in a activity or more. Other people think students and families have the decision to pick whether students should be involved in a extracurricular activities because the school can't force you do a sport you dont want to do and they can't push away your dreams of playing a sport. Generic_Name thinks schools need to control students involvements in the extracurricular activities because not a lot of parents care if they children have time for extra assignments or they don't care if their kids stay out late to participate in any activity related to school. First of all, people think schools should decide students involvement in activities. Some students want to play many sports but not all of them will have time to complete homework assignments or study fr any quizzes and tests. For example Generic_Name's older sister use to play two sports. One was related to school and the other one was outside of school. She never had time to do her homework so her grade was going down. She also had to study for her tests but she didn't have time since she was practicing her sport too much and so she failed the grade. Secondly, other people think students and families have the decision to pick whether students should be involved in activities. An example is Generic_Name's friend wouldn't want the school to not let him play the sport he always been wanting to play. Generic_Name's friend thinks it wouldn't be fair to force him to play a sport he doesn't like. Generic_Name, Generic_Name's friend would like to play a sport to distract his mind if he is stressing or is having depression. Generic_Name also wants to have the choice to pick any sport he would like to play but also wants to finish his work in class or study his tests during lunch or before school so he doesn't fail. Lastly, the majority of people think schools need to control students involvement in activities because not a lot of parents care if their children have time for assignments or to study for tests. In general parents don't care about their kids schools or grades so they won't worry if their kids are out late for any sport. One example, Generic_Name's aunt don't care about his cousin Generic_Name so she is always out late. Generic_Name wants to try a sport in school so she can get a scholarship to go to college since her parents don't care about her but she wants to be someone in life and do better things. She wants to decide on her own if she should join a sport or not. I think the school should control the students involvement in sports. The school should control the students involvements in sports because they're can be students that want to get a scholarship by playing a sport but also want to have time to finish classwork they couldn't finish in class or study their test to not fail the class.

60E9300D597C,"In today's world, success is often equated with never experiencing failure. However, this is a misconception as failure is an inevitable part of life. Many successful people have faced failure at some point in their lives, but they have triumphed over it and achieved great success. In this essay, I will research personal stories of successful people, reflect on my own personal experiences, analyze the ways that failure contributes to personal growth, consider how to stay focused and motivated in the face of failure, and explore how the support of family and friends can help overcome failure.

Firstly, I will research personal stories of successful people to learn how they triumphed over failure. There are many examples of successful people who have faced failure in their lives. For instance, Thomas Edison failed over 1,000 times before he successfully invented the light bulb. Similarly, J.K. Rowling faced rejection from numerous publishers before finally finding one that accepted her Harry Potter series. These examples demonstrate that failure is a natural part of the journey to success. By studying the ways that successful people have overcome failure, we can learn valuable lessons on how to persevere and achieve our own goals.

Secondly, I will reflect on my own personal experiences to see how failure has helped shape my life. I have faced failure in the past, and it has taught me valuable lessons. For example, when I failed a math test, I realized that I needed to study more and seek help from my teacher. This experience helped me to develop better study habits and improve my grades. Similarly, when I failed an audition for a school play, I realized that I needed to work on my acting skills and practice more. This experience helped me to become a better actor and eventually land a leading role in a school production.

Thirdly, I will analyze the ways that failure contributes to personal growth. Failure can be a powerful motivator, as it forces us to reflect on our actions and identify areas for improvement. When we fail, we are forced to confront our weaknesses and work on developing new skills. This process of self-reflection and growth can lead to greater success in the long run. Additionally, failure can help us to develop resilience and perseverance, which are essential qualities for achieving success.

36456C81A55A,"To most students, school is like a black hole that they would do anything not to fall into. Kids go to school and sit for seven hours, and then go home and do almost the same thing. It's not healthy for them and it makes them dread school even more. Students are constantly falling asleep throughout the day because they don't have anything to look forward to, and that makes them feel as if school isn't as important as it is. If they don't have any fun, then they won't try in school whatsoever. If students are doing extracurricular activities, they'll be way more active and less tired throughout the day. I think that students should be required to do an extracurricular activity because it will get them involved in their school, it will keep them active in many ways, and they will learn more about everything around them.

First, Extracurricular activities will get students involved in their school. For example, they'll be representing their school. You're representing your school in any activity you pick, but you especially if you're playing a sport. Sports teams are like little families in the school, and the people playing on them love their teammates and love the place they're playing for. If all the kids are required to do an extracurricular, and get to choose to play a sport, they'll get to meet lifelong friends and be the face of their school. This can make students love school so much more than they used to. Next, they will also be just as involved in their school if they do an activity like yearbook. In yearbook, you're constantly learning about the kids in your school and all your surroundings. Most kids barely get to know half of the people in their grade, but if they're learning about the people around them, they can get to know almost everyone. Finally, it'll be a chance for them to make new friends. As I said, most students barely get to know everyone they go to school with, and a lot of times they're to shy to try to get to talk to new people. When they're put in a club or an after school¬†activity, they learn how to communicate with others. Clubs could help so many people make new friends.

Secondly, it will keep students active in many ways. For instance, playing a sport would be very good for any and all students. Constantly moving and exercising would help them stay active and fit, which is good for everyone. Most of your years in school you are required to do physical education, but sometimes you're barely even moving during the class. Sports will keep kids much more active than any class could. Also, being involved in an activity like student council or yearbook would keep their brains running and being used. They would always be coming up with new ideas and working on them/figuring out how to pursue them. When most students go home, they shut off their minds and are barely using them, causing them to not be as prepared to use them the next day. If they have to stay after school¬†for student council or yearbook, they'll still be using their brain. Lastly, students will actively learn communication skills. Communicating is so important in your life and will forever help you. You can't be in a club or play on a sports team and never learn how to communicate, because of this they will actively be learning new communication skills.

Finally, these activities can help students be more confident. First off, some students think that they are alone in this world and that they is no one else is like them. If students join clubs that interest them, it'll show them that they are not alone and that there are other people that are similar to them. Even if they aren't doing something they're familiar¬†with, there will be other kids that are also trying it for the first time. Second, clubs and groups teach them how to talk to people. As I have said, you can't be involved in a group or on a team and not communicate with them. If students are basically required to talk to other people during the activities, it'll boost their confidence and help them talk to new people on their own. Last but not least, these activities will show them that they are good at something. It is very common for young kids to think that they are horrible at everything, especially if school and learning isn't their strong suit. These clubs can show them that they do have skills and are good at something.

In conclusion, I think that students should have something to look forward to in school and not want to do anything to be out of going. They shouldn't have to wake up in the morning and dread going to a place they should love. This is why extracurricular activities should absolutely be a requirement. They have so many benefits and there will be many good outcomes. If extracurricular¬†activities become a requirement, students will become more involved in their school and everything around them, they will stay active in multiple ways and constantly be fit, and these activities will help boost up their self confidence.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

AF3A719533E9,"Hey you! Do you want do something good for your school, or even your community? Well it sounds like a plan. Our principal here at Generic_Name, has decided, that all students must participate, in at least one extracurricular activity. With this decision I agree for three reasons. I agree because it will keep kids busy, out of trouble, and help some of us with our social life.

Being active everyday is a huge importance in life, especially fro us and while we are young. And sitting at home on social media is not going to help, so join a sport, to keep you active for at least an 1 hour or more. If you are going through some personal issues, doing an extracurricular activity can take your mind off of that. So for these reasons keeping our bodies busy is good alternative, rather than being bored.

To have a well organized goals set throughout life, is very organized. If you are someone who gets in trouble a lot, think about setting goals for yourself. For instance, you could set a goal for ways you can keep yourself out of trouble and even getting negativity out of your life. Therefore doing the right thing is never wrong, so do something for the school, that could help you set a better pathway for your future goals. Sometimes there are people in your life that could be a bad influence on you, and to let them go out of your life is better for you than them being there and ruining your bright future.

In high school having your career plan is a good start in life. With the start of your career path, the first skill with that is communication. As a result of a good career, having a social life in high school is important. Joining Student Council Association (SCA), playing a sport, and presenting a project in class, is all where great communication can come from. For example, if you are in the SCA you have to deliver important upcoming events, new changes, and plenty more information for your peers. Now think to yourself. . . "" Do I want a great career or not?'

So with the principal's decision I agree to his decision he has made. Just think about it, doing more is always better including being occupied, staying out of trouble, and boosting your social life. The reasoning for my agreement is because it shows some people do actually care about us, and to me I find that very important.

B9733BDA883E,"Hey, I'm just a regular 8th grader, but I think classes like arts, music, and drama are super important in high school. They're not just about being creative or making pretty things, they actually teach us some serious skills that we need in life.

First of all, these classes help us learn how to communicate better. When you're in a drama class, you have to work with other people to create a scene or a play. You have to listen to each other, take turns talking, and work together to make it all come together. It's like a big team project, and you have to learn how to work together to get the job done. And that's not just limited to drama class ‚Äì it's true for any class where you're working with other people.

And it's not just about talking ‚Äì these classes also teach us how to listen. In music class, you have to listen to the teacher or your fellow students playing an instrument. You have to pay attention to the rhythm and the melody, and you have to be able to follow along. It's like a big game of follow the leader, and it helps you develop your listening skills.

But that's not all ‚Äì these classes also teach us how to be more confident. When you're up on stage performing in front of a bunch of people, you have to be able to handle the pressure. You have to be able to speak clearly, move with confidence, and not get nervous or flustered. It's like a big challenge, and it helps you build your confidence and stage presence.

And let's not forget about the social skills we learn in these classes. When you're in a drama class, you have to work with other people to create a scene or a play. You have to be able to take direction, give feedback, and work together to make it all come together. It's like a big team project, and you have to learn how to work together to get the job done. And that's not just limited to drama class ‚Äì it's true for any class where you're working with other people.

A5056E812783,"If you ask people ""When are you feel happy?"". Most of them can respond that they feel happy in some kind when they are succesful, with a less of problems and failures. But what are in the another side of this success? How people get this success? Nobody can't tell whole way of getting succesful. But why?

Everyone went a hard, full of pitfall way. It wasn't easy, it was hard when you tried to achieve one's goal. Succesful people hadn't easy way of getting succesful. Failure is in some kind examination, challenge for us when we are trying to stay succesful. Succesful people must pass all kind of failure examination that to show that they are strong, sturdy, and patient. Success doesn't like weak and whiner people.

For example, famous people like musicians and composers: Bach, Mozart, Beethoven; writers like Shakespeare, Stendal, Tolstoy, and Pushkin; scientics like Einshtein and Tesla. They all are famous now, because in their time they had goal: be succesful and do those things that they are like to do by their soul and heart. They had failures and opponents, peoples who just only hate and envy them. And now you're just can only imagine on how much those people were full of enthusiasm and pation that we know about them now, in our time. They are examples of succesful people for us now.

Nobody of famous and succesful people don't tell you that it was easy way of stay succesful. Because it is true. And everyone has different failures; you can't feel those failures like feels those person by itself. And nobody can't tell you that the way to stay success will be easy. It is a very big number of people, who pray to achieve their goal, but with the first failures they just stopped and go back, they loss their enthusiasm. And this people just need to be pushed with someone with the words ""Hey! What's happen? This is all all that you can show? Other people have more failures then you, you must go forward! You mustn't to be afraid to see with your eyes your failure. You must be strong."" And I think they can find some strength.

There are a lot of different meetings, conferences, and seminars with a succesful and famous in some way people. There you can hear more good things that can help you to improve, to achieve your goal and stay succesful. But you can't hear all of the failure that would be connected personaly with you, and on how much it can be hard, that you still have enthusiasm that help you to solve your problems and improve. When you stay on the way to achieve your goal, because of the failures you can forget why you do all this things, you need to remember all of the good things you now that will be when you achieve your goal and stay, at first, success for yourself. With a failures you stay more self-controlled, and grew up more inside of you, stay more confident in your deed.

In our life we stay succesful with everyday for ourself too. We have some small and big goals that we want to achieve. Our life is the way to stay succesful. We are achieve our goals for stay succesful in the school, in the college or university, in the sport, and on the work.

To stay succesful it is not easy way with a failures that pursuit us. But we need remember for what we stay on this way, way to stay succesful.",0,original_moth,"Task:

B1E1608C016D,"'Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.''-Churchill once said this phrase during WW2 to tell his people that it didn't matter how many battles Britain was going to lose but that they were going to win the war. Personally I do agree with Prime Minister Churchill many times on my life I have fail, and fail again but I got up because I knew that there was a good price at the end. Humans now at days think that life is all about planing the future, and they all just trying to avoid problems, trying to live only winning but to reach success there must be a long journey of lost battles, of big problems but you must stay put because it does not matter how many times you fall you most get up again, and again.

My Dad once told me ''Always try never give up''. Back in 2014 it was my first day on the soccer academy

I been playing soccer as a defender all my life but this time it was my first time training in such a good team I started training every day make some friends too. A few days later the first game came I was not on starting line up or on the bench I wasn't even call for the game I was upset but I though that it was because I was new in the team, or the coach didn't know me well. The next day during practice my coach call me out and told me if you wanted a spot on the team you need to work harder after that day I knew I needed to start training more, going to the gym more often, and I start eating more healthy a few days later during practice I started seeing results I was getting stronger, faster, and skillful a few weeks later I got called for the teams fourth game but I was not in starting eleven I was sitting on the bench the all game I was upset I though I was failure once more but I never gave up and the next day I was back practice, eating more healthy, going to they gym more often. Halfway during the season one of the the starting defenders left the team and I knew it was my chance I started and I play all the game and I didn't just prove my coach that capable more importantly I prove my self. Later during the season in one of the last games in one play I dislocated my arm and that meant that I was out for the rest of the season. After three long months of recovery after was heal I started once again training harder, eating healthy, going to the gym more often getting ready for the next season. beginning of 2015 that season I was chosen as team captain and I played all the games all that hard work was worthy at the end.

It dosen't matter how many times I failed I never lose my enthusiasm because in life we are going to have many failures and we will feel life given up but we most get up and keep going it doesn't matter how many times we lose a battle our main goal must be win the war because just like Churchill failed again, and again but at the end he won the war with his people I also failed in my team again, and again but I won my own war at the end.",0,original_moth,"Task: 

1. Take some time to reflect on how you have faced failure in the past and how you overcame it. 
2. Recall an example in your life (such as the soccer academy experience described in the essay) of when you experienced failure but didn't give up.

199246A25EFF,"What is your verdict on students no going to school by person but by video calls?

Hello there my name is Generic_Name a resent subject has popped up in the new resent on students who can attend classes from home by online video chat or by video and how does that work for classes yes now a days schools are using ""less and less paper everyday"" and transfer paper work in to files and programs for students and yes its very adviston and safe for the environment but does it make it better to learn.

Distance Learning

Let's Start off with The Pros and Cons

It will make it easier for students who have social problems or for the students who are too shy

It will help students have fiscal disability or mental disability who need medical treatment like med's or help from a parent or Nears

For students who are out sick or badly injured and need to stay home but having the will to learn the this will help a lot

Students who are out of state and cant get to classes because of family problems but have time

Students who have a part time or full time job that who need the money to live on but have the will to learn and keep up with school and classes

Teachers who have privet problems can set up class work and send it to students

One on one toturals¬†and teaching for the student interndutshon¬†on new subjects you can have international classes and learn new things online extra project that need more time that cant be done in normal school but only online

Now for the negative reasons this will not work

Not showing up to classes at all and not logging in being in the video class but looking at another screen in the computer not paying at actions coming in to the video call when ever and not being on time lack of work copying and pasting will be easier with a different screen

The teacher not know if your cheating on work or tests students who lie and not show up too school or the classes call taking very long brakes playing games or texting extra and still being in the video call and pretend to learn

The benefits¬†and Flaws are¬†pretty much equal but yes Students can abuses and go around¬†it but they many ways to prevent them like putting pass cods or blocking websites or games extra but not all can help but how this will benefit student are for the disabled or the injured mostly but for rear events like a student who want to study from other schools or even international classes that would be a big win for students who dont have the money but that have the will to learn.

But mostly it should be a prevliage¬†to do classes online just for students who have problems but have the will to learn and expanded.

Non-Distance Learning

In simply words going to normal classes and school

Meeting the Prophesiers and classes mate learning in parson and how they teach learning life skills and language skills socializing improving meeting classes mate and one day being you long life friends joining into clubs and after school programs getting privet help life expresses and challenge's programs that is offered to help in the long run like more classes,trips,colleges/unavistys extra growing a persons and not being isolated

The only Negatives part on going to to real school is that it can get challenging and rough but anything then that is fine because¬†that the way of life. Life never get easy but its good how this will show you in school not at home reasons if you did't go to school then when its time to go the the real world it will it you like a tuck and at school you can learn many thing not by the teachers but by class mate and friends and that the beauty of going to school and meeting many different people because everything and every one has a story to tell.

""Can a screen do that?""

So in conclusion with many different opinions my choice is that its

NOT Benefits the students the reasons why is that theres many flaws and down that it doesnt help at all and now a day kids gotten so smart that they can find ways to go around blocks and cods yes it removes the benefit of international classes but that the only thing about it you cant get life expresses but looking at a screen that removes the learning part of life.

Learning in school it the best way why is that because you get too meet others and and make friends maybe even life long friends and how life is for them¬†out there life is never easy and so that will happen in school.

you will hit though rounds in school¬†but if you go though it and pass it that means you getting better and when the day comes when you get on the stage and get that diploma that when you know you made it and your ready for the real world school show you that and give you the expresses you need to live on and that the beauty¬†of it youll never get that type of expressions on a screen.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,7
B286E6029ECB,"I remember when asking in math class on how to do something and if there are other ways to do it and feeling the movement of my pencil and hearing on what it had to say when being written down. What is happening there is that I knew one way to do it but I wanted to know if there was other ways to do it. And if so which way I pick would be the easier way for me to get my answer for that type of problem. When seeking multiple opinion it can help someone make a better choice because it can help them lead in to a better option and help them show different ways on how to do something.

First reason on when seeking multiple opinion to make a person choice better is because it can help them lead into a better choice. When answering question on paper people may ask the teacher to ask to help them or a friend to help them with it. For example, when I don't know something I ask a friend or my teacher to help me lead to a better choice for that problem. So when people have math class they might ask a question if they can help the or a friend to dot he same. For example, when I in math class and some of friends who don't get it, I tell them the way to do it and lead them in the way to the right answer.

Second reason when seeking multiple opinion to help someone make a better choice is because it can help them show different ways to do it. When doing math there can be different ways on how to do something like your times table. For example, When I do my times table I just know it but for other I would use a calculator for it or just do it myself. Another way in math is when you divide because just like you when you times something there are different ways on how to do something. For example, in math I just know it but if I don't then I use a calculator to help me with that question.

In conclusion, when seeking multiple opinion it can help someone by making a better choice because it can show them different ways on how to do it and lead them to a better option. Just like when I was in math feeling that the way I knew was to hard I found a different one and made my life easier. An when seeking multiple option it can help you thing differently, and if knowing if there are other ways to do something. Just like when you are in math learning the other ways to do something or by show a friend the easier for you that you use. By that that just show that mulitlple option can help you or someone else to make the better choice.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
282920A19940,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is a great thing! Helping the community in any way is considered a good thing, and I think it's great that some students are doing this on their own already! But you and I both know that there are other kids that could care less about what goes on where they live, or how it needs help. And that's why I have a proposition for you.

I think that every student should be required at least one hour of community service each semester. Because everyone should be involved in the community, and the community could always use some help! No matter if it's picking up trash along the roads, or assisting at a an elderly home, help is always good.

Now of course, there will have to be proof that each student did their hour. I think the best way to do this would just simply be a signature. All we need is a slip of paper that the student can fill out, telling what they did as service, and for how long. Like, say, a student worked for two hours a soup kitchen. Then one of the workers at the kitchen could sign the students slip.

For some students, that one hour will be something they do just to get it over with, and then wont even think about again until next semester. For others, they'll do their one hour, and then maybe five extra hours after that.

And for those people, I think there should be a reward! The reward could be that for every extra hour each student does, they earn a homework pass. I'm sure if you decided to move with that idea, you'd have to get the teachers consent, though. Or maybe the reward could be a party at the end of the semester for the people that worked extra hours.

Needless to say, if there's a reward involved, most likely there will be more people willing to work extra hours. And eventually, those same people who thought, ""The community is fine. I shouldn't waste my time trying to make it any better than what it already is!"", will realize what kind of good they can do for others around them on a daily basis!

EB8030177678,"As an eighth-grade student, I have come to understand the importance of staying active and never idling in life. Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, once said, ""Determine never to be idle ... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote highlights the value of being constantly active and avoiding idle time. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of staying busy and how much can be accomplished by being always doing.

Firstly, staying active helps individuals to achieve their goals and aspirations. When we are constantly working towards something, we are more likely to make progress and achieve our desired outcomes. For example, if a student wants to get good grades, they need to study regularly and complete assignments on time. By staying active and working hard, they can achieve their goal of getting good grades. Similarly, if an individual wants to become a successful entrepreneur, they need to work hard, network, and take calculated risks. By staying busy and actively working towards their goal, they can increase their chances of success.

Secondly, staying active helps individuals to develop new skills and knowledge. When we are constantly learning and growing, we become more knowledgeable and skilled. For instance, if a person wants to learn a new language, they need to practice speaking and listening regularly. By staying active and practicing, they can improve their language skills and become more proficient. Similarly, if someone wants to learn a new hobby, they need to practice and experiment with different techniques. By staying busy and actively learning, they can develop new skills and interests.

Thirdly, staying active helps individuals to stay healthy and happy. When we are constantly engaged in activities that we enjoy, we are more likely to feel happy and satisfied with our lives. For example, if a person enjoys exercising, they are more likely to feel energized and healthy. Similarly, if someone enjoys spending time with friends and family, they are more likely to feel happy and fulfilled. By staying active and engaging in activities that bring us joy, we can improve our mental and physical health.

In conclusion, staying active and never idling in life is crucial for achieving our goals, developing new skills and knowledge, and staying healthy and happy.

96EF3E46E165,"our school is made up of many school averages. When i heard that my principal was considering that b averages was the only way you could play a sport i was very surprised at the news. There are many reason why the principal shouldn't do this because many kids that's all they look forward to in school, they make get averment's with there sports, and they have great talents in there sport. Have you ever thought about it that way before?

first, many students think about getting out of school so they think about what they will do after, some students will text, watch tv,or what they would do a sport they love that makes them feel open and free and not have to worry about any of the small things that get to them like school,drama,and problems at home. i think ever students should be able to have the opportunely to be free and open in ever little thing they do wirthery they have a B average to.

many kids that i see make great averment's in there sports. they sportsman ship awards,fca awards they can get chiocoin to be the team captain those things change people in many ways so they could be like i am not doing so hot in school maybe i should care more about my school work and my sports. Their coach's influences them in many ways to the try for there goals in life and they want them to be a good player and a good academies student as well.

many students that i seee have get talnet in vereything they do i dot think that she school should be able in anyway to do that because if that was the case most all the students at my school wouldn't be in the sport. alot of talnet was natural and comes naturely so the school admester will never evre have the otherity to take that away from anyone.

D03CE04CF47C,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on how to attain self-esteem as an average 8th grade student:

Self-esteem is like a puzzle, and we're all trying to find the right pieces to make it complete. It's hard to feel good about yourself when you're always comparing yourself to others or feeling like you're not good enough. But there are things we can do to build our self-esteem and feel better about ourselves.

First, it's important to respect yourself. That means treating yourself with kindness and compassion, even when you make mistakes or don't do as well as you want to. It's easy to get caught up in the idea that we have to be perfect, but nobody is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes, and that's okay. It's how we learn and grow.

Another important thing is to put in effort. When we try our best and put in effort, we feel good about ourselves because we know we're doing something worthwhile. It doesn't matter if we don't get the outcome we want right away. What matters is that we're trying. And when we do get the outcome we want, it feels even better because we know we worked hard for it.

Behavior is also a big factor in our self-esteem. When we act with kindness and empathy towards others, we feel good about ourselves because we know we're making a positive impact on the world. And when we treat others with kindness and respect, they're more likely to treat us the same way. It's a cycle of positivity that can help us build our self-esteem.

Finally, education can play a big role in our self-esteem. When we learn new things and expand our knowledge, we feel good about ourselves because we know we're growing and improving. It doesn't matter if we're good at something or not ‚Äì what matters is that we're trying. And when we get good grades or do well in a class, it's a great feeling because we know we've worked hard for it.

In conclusion, self-esteem is something we can build by respecting ourselves, putting in effort, behaving well, and educating ourselves.",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Write an essay discussing how to attain self-esteem.

08C05F2480E4,"Did you know that when people are giving you advise someone else told that person the same thing! This is why some people probably don't have advise for you when you ask for some. But when people ask for advise they will most likely ask their family members, people who inspire them, and their current or old teachers.

When a person is going to ask for advise the first people they will probably ask is their family members. The first people in the family that would most likely ask is their parents. The reason for this is because they have been living with them most or their life or even their whole life. The next people in their family that they would ask would probably be their grandparents. Everyone I feel like thinks their grandparents are old and wise and know every thing but they I got admit they do have some good advise. The last person in the family someone would ask would be their brothers or sisters. You have been living with them most if not part of your life, and you wanted to move you could ask them for places they have been to that they liked or the best moving company. People ask what if you don't have any family members to look up to well who is been your inspiration in life.

Other people that you can ask or look up to for good advise is the people who inspire you. Say you don't a person who inspires you. Well you always have your parents or other family members. Most of time people who inspire you, you can most likely never see once in your life in person, so what do you do. You can go on the internet and search famous quotes that they said, or you can watch some television shows or YouTube videos of them talking inspirational. A person who can even inspire you could even be your friends. You have been with your friends your whole life so you always ask for good advise because they care for you. Well what if you don't want to ask someone who inspires you, well almost everyone went to school growing up so you always have your teachers.

While growing up almost everyone went to school and while you their everyone had teachers to teach you life skills. Most teachers you have had posters all over the walls with good quotes or great advise. You can always look at these posters and use them in your everyday life. A teachers job is to teach you life skills that you can use as a adult. So when a teacher give you advise you always use that advise any day of your life. Even after school is over you can still go back and ask them. The reason being is that they care for you, even if you were a bad student they will still help you. In the long run if you need help from a teacher you can always just stay after school and ask, go back if you have already left the school, or even look at those inspirational posters.

In conclusion their are lot of different people that you could get advise from. You can get advise from your family, people who inspire you, and your old or current teachers. Next time if I'm looking for good advise I would defiantly see one of these people.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

I think that all students should do community.

I think this because it help out our country. We will have less trash all over the streets. There will be more stuff we can put in the recycling bin instead of throwing it away we can renew it save on killing in trees that we killing in rainforest. animals in water will not die if we don't throw things in sewers. If we watch parents kids for them that will save time them. If we tutor little elementary kids that will help them improve their grades better in their classroom. We can go to the elderly hospital and help the workers with their jobs. The senior citizens might would like to talk to some young kids every once in a while.

We should help some adults by cleaning up their store after their finally closed it down. You can also organize their items so they can run the cash register. You can cut the grass for the people in your neighborhood. You can also walk every adults dog for 30 minutes every day for a month. You can wash your mama car if she needs a break.

You can watch your baby brother's or sister's for your mama while she goes out.

971D470138C0,"I believe that the new technology which is called the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea that will help value students in a classroom . The Facial Action Coding System can help determine the way you feeling , reliezes that you might need help on a lesson that you are not comprehending very well , also it knows when something is bothering you .

When on a computer the Facial Action Coding System determines the way you feeling when the computer constructed 3-D face model revolves around all fourty four major muscles in a human face . When you show emotion towards the computer and have a movement of one or more muscles it is called a action unit which helps the com puter bring all your emotions together and be able to seperte them into they percentages . For example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle ( above your eyes) raises your eyebrows which means your surprised . Your orbicularis oris ( around your mouth) tightens your lips that shows your angry . There many muscles in a human face that has a variety of different ways to show their emotions .

The new technology can also relieze when something is bothering you . For example when your friend ask "" whats wrong ? "" and you say nothing your friend dictated that you were lying so his/her mouth would stretch sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle , the risorius hich means dont lie . Also it can tell when you are putting on a fake smile and actually hurting inside . The computer is actually showing empathy by feeling someone elses emotional state . Theory of emotion , moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them .

When struggling on a lesson on the computer the Facial Action Coding System will notice . However "" a classroom computer could relieze when a student is becoming confused or bored , then it will modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor ."" The same technology can make computer - animated faces more expressive - fro video games or video surgery . But also on the other note the new technology couldnt be the best idea due to the fact that some people are going through some stuff and school is a way to clear they mind and going on a computer at school with the new technology would remind them .

Many people dont relieze when their closest friends are going through something and the new technology would him .

AF08E64C79CE,"Cars. Trucks. Motocycles. All these forms of transportation are drastically poluting the air due to the release of gas emission from the tailpipes. Some may say it's easier to get around with a car handy. Others believe too many people are centered on a car. Cities should become denser for the public in order to transport and reduce gas emission at the same time.

Up to 50% of car intensive areas are poluted in the United States as well as 12% in Europe. Drivning isn't the only way to get around. In Vauban, Germany- some in the communtity have taken the pledge to give up thier cars and go green. In result to doing this, locations like garages are generally not used to hold a four wheel vehicle anymore. Instead this ""car free"" area is encouraging those to join the 70% of Vauban's population to say goodbye to the waste product. In addition to a ""car free"" zone comes ""smart planning"". This is the practice of seperating the suburban life from auto use. In other words, creating a more condenced community will ensure more walkers instead of drivers.

Similar to both the US and Germany, many areas have committed to giving up the cars. In Paris, pollution had gotten so bad they almost hit a record! Depending on the even or odd number license plate along with the day that came with it, people were ordered to leave their car and/or motor vehicle home or pay a 22-euro fine. Pollution was down 60% in France after the period of time enforcing the rule. In Bogota, Colombia most chose to walk, bike, skate, or take a bus to get around, leaving the city barren of any to no vehicles. With a capital of 7 million a goal was reached reducing smog throughout the city. Violators paid the price of $25 fines.

Other research may suggest that leaving the cars home decreases some ability to get around at a decent time or may even cost just as expensive. Having somewhere to be and knowing you have to be their can be a haslte prioritizing your time. You have to calculate when you leave from both your home and the destination. Those who live in big cities will struggle even more from time to time. If cars on the street are limitted to taxis then the cost to get to a location will be as similar to that of a gas bill. Not only that but areas will require more taxi services to fill those needs of the people.

Vehicles, the deathly poison of the human race, will continue to pollute the area unless something is done. Many areas have taken the step to create more suitible living conditions of the human race. Globally, we are reducing the exposure of gas emission everywhere. Continuing this will ensure a heallthy present and furture for years to come.¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
64C6CB509C0C,"Dear Principle,

I believe that you should allow students to use cell phones during free time at school, only during time that they ( students) have when they aren't in class learning.

The student will still be getting his/her academic needs.

Cell phones will not change that if you follow through with your policy one, which tells the student to turn off all devices before instructional time.

with this policy students will not sneak and use cell phones.

Most of the time they get caught and you have to go through with the child complaining about why they where using the phone and so forth.

Well, if the policy is enforced students would not have a reason to use to cell phone if they have just used it during free time.

why not allow this reasonable policy?

Its perfect and you can modify the problems as you go on and enforce this policy.

Therefore, nothing will be changed only the teachers, knowing there is a turned off cell phone in a students pocket, but if the students cant follow the rules band cell phone from whom ever disobeys the policy.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
614D5160B5B0,"Driverless cars can be seen as an advantage or a shipwreck waiting to happen. Yes, humans have dreamed of this technology for generations, but is it truly what we need? Honestly, driverless cars could potentially cause more harm than good. They even sound scary: if a person, not in their right mind, can't drive a car functioanlly, then why can a computer? A super being that can't even think for themself? I am against the developement of these cars because they're too expensive to manufacture at a good rate, they require a driver at some point in time, and they're illegal in various areas of the United States.

As explained in the article, two seperate companies already came up with patents for driverless vehicles. They used electrical cables/ magnents within the road to create a path that the automobile could follow. As said in paragraph three, these ideas worked surprisingly well, yet they were too expensive to be practical. This idea was invented decades ago; everything was cheaper back then. Now a days, this idea also seems inpractical. the cost for these ""smart cars"" will remain insanely costly. the manufacturors will be out money because the people won't be able to afford these high priced gadgets.

I, for one, love car rides when I can't sleep at night. They help me drift off into sleep so easily and in a such a fast manor. Hundreds of people across the globe fall asleep at the wheel of an aoutmobile every week. Even with all the distractions of driving, they can't resist falling alseep. So imagine, having no distractions at all, how easy it would be to doze into that comfortable state of mind. In the article it states that drivers are occasionally needed when the car is faced with a difficult task. If driver drifted off to sleep, a wreck is bound to happen. I also feel as though too many people will put too much faith into their vehicle that they'll become unaware and uncareful about what's going on in particular scenarios that they are needed in, and they'll find themselves in a fateal accident.

What good if a car in a round country trip if it's illegal to drive in certain states? What are people supposed to do if they cross the boarder into a state that disapproves of these new and ""improved"" vehicles? Just turn around and take another route? It's pointless to have a vehicle you can't take everywhere with you. Laws aren't just made for no reason; they're there to keep the community safe. If it's supposedly dangerous to ride in an un-manned vehicle, then why do it? In paragraph nine, it states that presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. I believe in this law wholey and completely.

In my opinion, driverless cars are unsafe. There are many statistics and facts stating that safety is a huge risk with these vehicles and it's very true. A computer cannot possibly predict how a human mind will act or what a person will do unconciously; these vehicles won't be able to have last minute reactions.

I am against the developement of these cars because they're too expensive to manufacture at a good rate, they do require a driver at some point in time, and they're illegal in various areas of the United States. Driverless cars are thought to be the future; I want no part in such a dangerous place. ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
D2517350CB3A,"Hey there!  So, I've been thinking a lot about elective classes and how they can affect our education. I mean, they're pretty important, right? Like, they give us a chance to explore different subjects and stuff. But, there are pros and cons to them, you know?

One pro is that they can help us figure out what we're actually interested in. Like, if I never took a art class in middle school, I might still think I want to be an artist when I grow up. But, after that class, I realized I'm more into drawing and painting, you know? So, it's good to have those options.

Another pro is that they can help us develop new skills. Like, if I take a cooking class, I'll learn how to make different dishes and maybe even start my own food truck one day. Or, if I take a coding class, I'll learn how to make apps and websites, which can be really useful in the future.

But, there are also cons. One con is that they can be distracting. Like, if I'm supposed to be studying for a math test, but I'm also in a drama club, I might get distracted and forget about the math. Or, if I'm in a sports class, I might get so into it that I forget about my other classes. That can be bad.

And, some people might not be interested in the elective classes they're offered. Like, if I'm not into sports, but I have to take a sports class, I might get bored and not pay attention. Or, if I'm not into music, but I have to take a music class, I might not learn anything. That's why it's good to have choices, you know?

But, research shows that taking elective classes can have educational benefits. Like, studies have shown that students who take elective classes are more likely to do well in school and have better grades. And, they're more likely to go to college too. That's because elective classes can help us figure out what we're interested in and what we're good at, which can help us pick a college major.

E418CA5F2D7A,"Driveless cars are becoming a new idea and have been an experiment to try and make a perfect driveless car. Many different people have worked to come up with a flawless car that doesn't need a human behind the wheel. Although the idea is intriguing, i am not for driveless cars. There are many pros and cons of a drivelss car, however the cons out way the pros.

Pros of a driveless car: less human errors, uses half the fuel of today's taxis, far more flexibility, and they're just cool. Less human errors would occur since they wouldn't even have to touch the wheel in the first place. In the article it discusses how less fuel would be used which ulimately helps save our budgets and environment. More flexibility would occur because wherever you desire to be, your car would be able to tke you and pick you up. Now, driveless cars are just plain cool. Who wouldn't want a car to make all the decisions while you just relax until you meeet your destination? Although there are pros, the cons are just to great.

Cons of a driveless car: more accidents, not totally drivelss, disputes between manufactuerer and owner, expensive, too many chnages need to be made. Having a car that can drive for you is cool but the danger is just too high. The name of the car is very deceptive because to this day they aren't completely driveless, some still alert the driver when it is unable to drivve throug hcertain condidtions such as roadblocks or accidents. More accidents would occur because humans would rely on the automobile to drive itself when in fact the human must still be alert and awake. In paragraph 9 it discusses how there would be disputes between who would be responsible if the automobile system shut down. Should it be the manufacturer or the human in the car? Too man y laws would have to be instilled just because someone wants to make a new invention. Even with all these cons, the list could go on and on.

Many people would love to have a driveless car, however they wouldn't want all the risk and cons that come with a driveless car. The invention would be cool and unique, however it just isn't practical. In my opinion driveless cars should stay in movies and not be out on the streets. They are dangerous and there would be far too many disputes brought on by owning on. Driveless cars would indeed fundamentally change the world like the article implies, the change just wouldn't be for good.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
111D45750F1E,"I'm against having driverless cars because I don't think that driverless cars will ever work properly without getting into a wreck on its own. The cars wouldn't even be driverless because it would have to have a person turn them into and out of a driveway or dealing with complicated issues dealing with traffic. You're not just assisting a car you are driving the car still. It isn't 100% on its own on the road you would still have to help steer at certain spots. Therefore they can't be trusted because you could be approaching a stoplight that has a lot of traffic and then your car wouldn't stop you would have to stop it before it caused a wreck.

I would feel much more safe if I had just a regular, normal car that I could drive 100% of the time. The only safe car is a car that has a person in it and driving it. If it was a choice between the driver or the manufacturer I would definately say that it was the manufacturer because a good driver wouldn't wreck, or get injured. The car would though because a self driving car couldn't work and would cause way more wrecks than what there are now. Therefore I would never let a self driving car drive me around.

Like I said it wouldn't even be 100% on its own just the driving straight part of it. The car wouldn't be able to turn or go into traffic on its own, but a person can. That's why I'm against Driverless Cars and why I don't think that any of them would work.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
BFFFCC7D5602,"Have you ever heard of the face on Mars? In 1976 the Viking 1 was going around Mars to look for a landing spot for Viking 2. They found something that looked to be a face. It was about 2 miles long in a region called Cydonia. The unusual shadows of the ""face"" made it look almost to be an Egyptian Pharaoh.

The scientists just figured it was another Martian mesa which were common to the region, but the caption took notes of a ""huge rock formation, which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Nasa decided to take a closer look.

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture 10 times sharper than the original photo. It turns out it was just a natural landform. Not everyone was happy though, they say it was too cloudy to see if there were any alien markings.

Once again on April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took another picture on a cloudless summer day. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, says ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" The picture was so close that if there were anything on the ground we would've been able to see them. The picture shows the Martian is equivalent of a butte or mesa.

In conclusion, there were no alien momuments or anything weird happening. It was just a natural landform, although NASA wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars.                   ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
69B52531C7B0,"Vacations, relaxation, free time- these are just a few of the things students look forward to when the last day of school rolls around and summer vacation begins. But unfortunately summer is not just fun, students must maintain learning as well. From reading assignments to math packets summer work is inevitable, but if we change the guidelines to be more individualistic and open ended, students may be more motivated to utilize their knowledge in a meaningful way. Although teacher-designed projects may prepare students for the course ahead, summer projects should be student-designed because it will allows students to open their minds to creativity, projects will be more enjoyable and of higher quality, and it would be easier to manage.

Student-designed¬†projects promote creativity, which is one of the most useful skills today. Class curriculum is bound by specific expectations and allows little room for self driven deeper thinking. So, a student-based project would allow for students to explore topics that interest them and prompt them to dive deeper. When projects are less constricted and more open to interpretation, the outcome is an individualistic product that showcases one's individuality. For example, throughout different leadership clubs or classes students must come up with their own leadership project and propose a plan to achieve a specific goal. With each student having a different goal, each project is unique and expresses one's true self, with goals ranging from benefiting the homeless to saving the environment. The projects are not teacher-designed¬†and allow the student to explore their mind and come up with something creative yet specific to them. Skills like these are important to exercise because creativity and individuality is what will set one person apart from another in the real world, careers, and competition.

Not only will student-designed¬†projects prompt individuality, but they will also result in a higher quality product. When a project is based on something a person is genuinely interested in, it will lead them to enjoy the work they are doing. When one enjoys the work they are doing, they do a better job at it. For instance, we have been raised to pick a career that we enjoy because those who love their job are the ones that do it best. Therefore, we should do summer projects and school work the same way. Teacher-designed¬†projects that restrict creativity will be dreadful and considered as busy work to the student, which will result in work that is simply complete just to get checked off. But incorporating open ended possibilities will make summer learning more enjoyable compared to the endless stream of work during a regular school year, where close to everything is teacher-based. Teachers also would enjoy seeing projects of high quality that showcase an individual's drive to explore new things that are enjoyable to them rather than a repeat of the same five step project over and over again. Student-designed¬†projects will increase the quality and pleasure of the required summer work load.

Along with summer projects, students also need to balance work, family trips, and just enjoying life as a kid. Student-designed projects will allow one to manage their time in way that incorporates the project to their convenience. The regular school year brings enough stress with constant strict deadlines and expectations, so summer should be the time to let students breathe and mold projects around the components of break itself. No kid wants to work on their biology summer project during their beach vacation, but for example, students could incorporate an ocean or sea life based aspect to a self created project, that will not take away from the time spent on break. A trip to Europe can expand on a history project, rather than textbook readings and vocabulary words. Also, many teenagers are expected to maintain a job and earn money, and they may not have enough time to do a project molded by teachers who do not know details to each student's home life schedule. Students deserve the opportunity to indulge in a project that they believe fits best for themselves and the responsibilities they must tackle during the time that is meant to be a break from it all. Self-based projects will allow for students to incorporate learning into enjoyable things, so that is it more doable for them.

The warm weather and pool days should not be the only things students have to enjoy over summer break. With a student-designed project that is molded to an individual's schedule and interests, summer work could become enjoyable too. A rigid school year routine allows for a more flexible summer, which should also allow for a more flexible workload. Summer projects should be student-designed because they will prompt individuality, be of higher quality, and be done without extra stress to the teen. Making room for creativity and self-interest will result in a project that is more beneficial to the students in general. Enough of the expectations from students are teacher- designed, and as a society we would be surprised as to what amazing outcomes can come from promoting more individuality and freedom throughout learning.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

Firstly, participating in extracurricular activities can help students learn new skills. For example, if a student joins the school's drama club, they will learn how to act, memorize lines, and perform in front of an audience. Or, if a student joins the school's robotics club, they will learn how to build and program robots. These skills can be useful in the future, whether the student decides to pursue a career in acting or engineering.

Secondly, extracurricular activities can make students more well-rounded. If a student only focuses on their academics, they may miss out on other important aspects of life. By participating in extracurricular activities, students can learn about teamwork, leadership, and time management. They can also make new friends and discover new interests.

D95B78E39793,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that seeking advice from experts is crucial when making big decisions in life. The story of Christopher from Into the Wild illustrates the importance of guidance and the consequences of not seeking it. In this essay, I will analyze the example of Christopher and discuss how having guidance from experts can help support successful paths in life.

Christopher, the protagonist of Into the Wild, was a young man who decided to leave civilization and live in the wilderness. He believed that he could survive on his own and become self-sufficient. However, his lack of guidance and expertise in survival skills ultimately led to his tragic death. Christopher's story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of not seeking guidance when making big decisions.

Seeking advice from experts can provide valuable insights and knowledge that can help individuals make informed decisions. Experts have specialized knowledge and experience that can help individuals navigate complex situations and make better decisions. For example, when making a career decision, seeking advice from a career counselor can help individuals identify their strengths and weaknesses and choose a career path that aligns with their interests and skills.

Moreover, seeking guidance from experts can provide emotional support and motivation. When individuals are faced with difficult decisions, seeking guidance from experts can help them feel less alone and more confident in their choices. For example, when going through a divorce, seeking advice from a therapist can help individuals cope with the emotional turmoil and make decisions that are in their best interest.

In conclusion, seeking advice from experts is crucial when making big decisions in life. The story of Christopher from Into the Wild serves as a reminder of the dangers of not seeking guidance and the importance of having expertise in various fields.

4C6BB0618D7E,"Should summer projects be designed by teachers or students? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they are still learning during their break. The most simple thing to do, is to have the teachers design the projects, but why not let the students think for themselves. My take on this, is that students should have to put a little effort in, for once. Summer projects should be student-designed because they deserve some freedom, can show off their intelligence, and will help them develop life skills.

Some may say teachers are more educated and have more experience; That might be true, but how are the students supposed to get a real experience if they never get to design their own project. My friends like when a teacher gives the class a project that is already planned out. The reason they enjoy this is because they are lazy and do not have to do any work. Teachers know a lot of information which should be passed on to their students. Although, that statement is true, when do the students get to pass their information to the teacher?

Student-designed projects give the kids freedom in what they choose to do. At my old school, the students would have to read one book in the summer and then write a report on it. All my classmates would be so happy because they had the choice to read whatever they wanted. A teacher once told me, ""freedom is a gift; We do not get that gift often and it is a mistake."" This means, students are rarely given any freedom and all that does is limit them.

Student-designed projects would help teachers see how intelligent their students are. In

Kung Fu Panda , Master Shifu learns from watching Po move around the kitchen, that he has plenty of skill. In that scene, the master learns how much potential the student has by watching him do his own thing. In middle school, we would do our summer projects based on any news topic we read. This allowed the teachers to not only get an idea of who the students are, but also show them a baseline of how smart they are, as well.

The projects that students self-design will help them develop life skills. A student creating a project on their own teaches them responsibility and problem solving. The student will have to find a solution to their topic, which shows responsibility by being able to complete this task well enough, to receive a good grade. My father believes summer projects he had to create on his own assisted him to where he is today. My dad thinks this because it showed him time management, which is a life skill students will need forever.

Summer projects are meant to help students continue to learn over a long break. Although, why not make summer projects have more value? Instead, schools can help the students do more than just learn over break. Summer projects should be student-designed because they should have choice, will show off their intellect, and assists them in developing life skills. The school systems need to work together, to take action on making student-designed projects a priority, for getting students the best education.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,2

8778DE7C8D0E,"Okay! Here is an essay I came up with based on the prompt you provided:

Self-reliance is a great quality to have, but it's important to recognize when it's time to seek guidance from experts and authorities. Self-reliance means being able to take care of oneself and make decisions without relying on others. While this can be a valuable skill in many areas of life, there are some important matters where it's crucial to seek guidance from those who know more than we do.

First and foremost, experts and authorities have extensive knowledge and experience in their respective fields. Whether it's a doctor diagnosing a medical condition or a financial advisor making investment decisions, these individuals have spent years studying and working in their areas of expertise. They have a deep understanding of the complexities and nuances involved, and can provide valuable insights and recommendations that a self-reliant individual might not consider.

For example, let's say someone is considering a major life change, like switching careers or moving to a new city. While they might feel confident in their ability to make this decision on their own, consulting with a career counselor or a relocation expert could provide them with valuable information and advice that they might not have thought of on their own. These experts can help identify potential pitfalls and opportunities, and provide guidance on how to make the best decision for their specific situation.

Another reason why people who value self-reliance should seek guidance from experts and authorities is that they can save time and energy. Making important decisions can be time-consuming and emotionally draining, especially when it comes to complex issues. By seeking the advice of experts, individuals can avoid the stress and uncertainty of making these decisions on their own, and can instead focus on other areas of their life.

In conclusion, while self-reliance is an important quality, it's not always necessary or advisable to rely solely on one's own judgment when making important decisions. Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can provide valuable insights, save time and energy, and lead to better outcomes. So, the next time you're faced with a major decision, don't be afraid to seek the advice of those who know more than you do.",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

4C083F3FA3EA,"As technology and digital devices improve, more and more schools have begun to utilize them by offering the option to take a class at home by way of online or video conferencing. This allows students to have an empty slot in their class schedule which results in students being able to come to school late or leave school early. Allowing students to take their classes by way of online or video conferencing would not be beneficial because students would be able to cheat more easily, it would be harder to communicate with teachers, and students would get more distracted in online classes than¬†they would in school classes.

While the internet can provide long distance communication for a student to attend an online class, the internet can also provide the answers to assignments and work that the student may be assigned. If a student is allowed to take a class solely online, they will be inclined to cheat and look up answers. One counter argument that people have is that teachers have a way of seeing how many tabs are opened on the computer, but even if the teacher could see how many tabs were opened, the student could still use their phone or another digital device to look up answers. An online class would also make it easier to cheat because since the assignments would be all digital, students could utilize the copy and paste keys to look up answers quicker. If the student was taking the class at school instead, they could be given paper assignments and it would be harder for them to cheat. Online classes also make it easier for students to collaborate on assignments that they should be doing independently. Students could be using other students' help or they could be using previous students' work and it would be harder to identify.

Another reason why online classes would not be beneficial is because it would be harder to communicate with teachers. Some online classes may be taught by teachers who don't teach at the actual school the student attends. This makes it harder for students to ask them questions or ask for their help when they need it. This could cause students to not understand the topic completely and it might reflect in their grades. Online classes also make it harder for the student to build a relationship with the teacher. Because it is an online class, the student and the teacher don't really get to know each other and this could cause their relationship to be very weak. If the student was taking the in school class, they would have a stronger relationship with their teacher because the student would get to physically see and talk to the teacher every other day. The better the relationship between the teacher and the student is, the more likely it is for the student to go to the teacher and ask for help. Because the online teacher and student are not able to build a good relationship, the student might not ask questions to the teacher even if they don't understand the topic.

Another reason why online classes would not be beneficial is because students would be able to become distracted easier. Because the online class is done through video, teachers can not verify that there are no distractions present for the student. If the student was taking the class in school, the teacher would be able to see most distractions and could take them away. During an online class, the student could be able to use their phone away from the camera and the teacher would not know. This can cause the student to not pay attention to parts of the lesson and cause them to not understand as much as they might in an in school class. The student might have other distracting factors at home that would have been controlled at school like siblings or pets. At school you can produce a more focused environment than you could by taking an online class.

Online classes have some benefits, but have too many flaws to be beneficial to students. The flaws of cheating, lack of communication between teacher and student, and distractions make online classes an ineffective method of teaching. The system of online classes could be changed to try and make it more effective, but there are too many sacrifices made when you substitute in person teaching with online teaching.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,7
1E404144174D,"Summer, a time for sleeping in, enjoying the sunshine, and living the best life possible, is also a time where students tend to forget all of their learned information from school. Although summer vacation is a much needed break, it is also a time where information from previous year can be deleted. Some schools, because of this lack of knowledge retention, want to provide required summer projects in order to assure that students continue to learn over their long vacation. These projects should be teacher-designed, rather than student-designed, because it would ensure nobody falls behind, the correct curriculum is followed, and that grading is equal for all students.

Unfortunately, in many schools around the country, some students get left behind in their studies. Whether it be the teacher not adhering to their needs or just a lack of understanding without help to understand, some students just are not at the same level as everyone else. A teacher-designed project would allow all students to have the same opportunity for success. In this case, students will not have to stress about whether or not their project is good enough because everyone will have the same starting point. Some may argue that this would decrease individuality among students and discourage creativity, but it would, in fact, have the opposite effect. Since everyone is starting at the same point, students are encouraged to take the project any way they want and can show off their creativity to stand out from the rest of students. This strive for success to be the best among their peers would also make sure that no student underachieves. With a set teacher driven project, students can no longer just perform the easiest task at hand and call that their project. Teachers can set a baseline of what they want in their project. Since this project is in place to keep learning over summer, a teacher lead project would ensure that everyone is ready for the upcoming school year knowing the same amount as their peers, because they followed the curriculum their teacher prepared for them.

A teacher-designed project would put the teachers in charge of what their students learn and not the students in charge of what they learn, and that is their job, to teach. Teachers have the freedom to choose what they want for their students to learn over break; therefore, students will not get off topic and learn the wrong material. The freedom of a student-designed project may be too much for some and with this extended freedom, some students may go completely off the scope of the project. Teachers can decide for their students what they want done and how they want it done. The knowledge that their students are doing the right thing will put teachers at ease and be at peace knowing that when the school year restarts, all of their pupils will be on the right path and can pick off right where they left off before break.

The whole purpose of the summer project is to continue learning, and inside the school, projects are graded. Grading should be no different for these summer projects. With a same baseline for the project teachers are easily able to see who is achieving in the class and who may need some help. If students were to design their projects, some of them may choose easier projects than others and in this case grading would not be equal for everyone. The baseline would be created by an actual rubric with what is desired to be learned by students rather than students deciding what they want to have graded. The actual rubric would create fairness in grading and make completely sure that no student is getting an unequal advantage. With the learned project information, teachers can test and provide other sources for grading in class once school starts up again. Teachers will not have to worry about any one student not knowing what is going on and therefore can provide common tests and worksheets for students to do. For example in a biology class, one student could do a project on animal cells while another does a project on the DNA of a strawberry, it would be unfair to provide the same tests for these students. With a common project, common material is tested on and the teachers can be sure of this.

All in all a teacher-designed project would greatly benefit all at hand, not just students and not just the teachers. With a teacher-designed project students will all be at an equal level, with equal understanding, and equally graded. If teachers are paid to teach in schools, why should it suddenly switch to students teaching themselves over summer? Teachers are meant to teach, and students are meant to learn and this should remain the same all year round.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9
F1B1760AD63F,"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! üòÖ For this essay, I'm gonna talk about how collaboration, teamwork, and being considerate of others can lead to success in different situations.

First off, let's talk about the workplace. When people work together as a team, they can accomplish so much more than they could alone. For example, imagine a group of coworkers working on a big project. If they communicate well and listen to each other's ideas, they can come up with a better solution than any one person could on their own. Plus, it's way more fun to work with others than to do everything by yourself! üòÖ

But it's not just the workplace where collaboration is important. In families, teamwork can help solve problems and make everyone happy. For instance, if a family member is going through a tough time, the others can work together to support them and make sure they feel loved and cared for. And when everyone pitches in to do chores and errands, life becomes way less stressful! üßπ

Now, let's talk about school. When students work together on projects, they can learn from each other and come up with better ideas. Plus, it's way more fun to study with friends than to study alone! üìö And when classmates are considerate of each other, it creates a positive learning environment where everyone feels comfortable and supported. ü§ù

Finally, let's talk about social relationships. When people are considerate of each other's feelings and opinions, it can lead to stronger and more meaningful friendships. For example, if you're hanging out with friends and one of them is feeling down, you can listen to them and offer support. And when you're all working together on a group project, you can use each other's strengths to make it even better! ü§ù

In conclusion, collaboration, teamwork, and being considerate of others are super important for success in all sorts of situations. Whether you're at work, at home, or with friends, working together and being kind to each other can lead to amazing things! üåü So next time you're working on a",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Research and analyze how collaboration, team-work, and being considerate of others can shape success in different contexts.

80E36876B2CB,"No more junk food in the cafeteria anymore. Students need to start eating healthy, and take care of themselves so they can stay energetic for the rest of the day. Cafeteria needs to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu, which would eliminate some of the students favorite cafeteria foods. It's a good idea to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu because students will eat more healthy, students will not be obese, and they will be healthy instead getting sick every other day.

Majority of the people who eat healthy on daily basis are always in good health. My mom always eat healthy, and takes care of her diet, she's 60 years old, and she doesn't have any diseases or anything. She's in good health. So, she always tells me to stay determined to eat healthy, stay hydrated, and that should be the case for everyone else as well. Changing to a healthier menu is a good idea because students will eat well, and start to like the healthy food instead of the junk food. Eventually, students will start to like fruits and vegetables instead of chips and chocolates, and drink more water instead of soda, juice, and stay hydrated. They will be diligence towards their diet. Students will eat oat meal, milk, yogurt, and some fruits in the morning from the cafeteria. It would digest easily and students will not have stomachache or any other kind of pain in the morning after eating breakfast. In lunch, they will eat proteins, for example: meat, nuts, and beans, also milk, water, stay energized for the rest of the day, and not have any disease or pain.

Students will not be obese or gain a lot of weight. They will stay in shape because they will be eating healthy food from the cafeteria, and they will not have unhealthy condition of body or mind. Students will maintain their health, and stay fit by following their diet. Their body will not contain any impurities, and they will not have any diseases. Students will be able to play sports, run fast, accomplish their goals, and discover new things in life. Also, they will be more active. If you're fat then you become lazy, always not willing to work which is not good for health. You have to be productive in order to achieve your goals in life. Students will not eat junk food from the cafeteria anymore, and it would give students the opportunity to keep up with their body and be fit.

Students will be healthy instead of getting sick every other day. Eating healthy is good because you learn how to maintain your health, and it helps you to eat well. Students will the eat the food that is good for their health. Eating healthy on daily basis, and going to the gym maximum twice a week can keep them in shape, and get rid of the illness. Healthier school lunch menu would benefit a lot of students, and illustrate them ""To purify, and be bright"". My cousin Generic_Name used to eat unhealthy all the time, even from school cafeteria as well, and always used to cry about how her stomach used to hurt. After six months she gained weight, and she was crying about it that she's never going to be fit again because she gained too much weight, but my mom told her that there's always a second chance, she was eating unhealthy, and wasn't taking care of herself so that's why she gained weight. She told Generic_Name about her healthy diet and convinced her to immediately start eating healthy, stay hydrated, do not eat junk food on daily basis, and be diligence about working towards her goal to be fit. Generic_Name listened to my mom and started eating healthy, she lost weight right after 8 months, and her stomach didn't used to hurt like it used to before all the time, that's why students need to eat healthy food from the cafeteria, and take care of their diet because they spend majority of their time in school. It might not be the best food for the students but it's good for their health.

Junk food is not good for health. Cafeteria should have healthy lunch menu. So, students can have the opportunity to eat healthy and not face any dificulties related to their health. It's a very good idea to tell students to fix their diet, and start to become responsible for what is good for their health and immune system. Students will not gain a lot of weight if they stick to their diet and eat healthy from the cafeteria. Students wil not have stomachache or any other diseases. They will be able to trust the process of eating healthy, and keep up with it. Cafeteria should only have healthy food. So, people can minimize the amount of junk food they eat on daily basis.",0,original_moth,"Task: Analyze the benefits of transitioning from a junk food cafeteria menu to a healthier one.

B127CFD81E92,"Do you want to be forced to do an activity that you'd not want to do, or have an extra activity to deal with after school? I think not, well apparently some schools are thinking about having students do at least one extracurricular activity¬†after school. They also they might force kids do activities that there not interested in to get used to the real world.

After school activities might take away some free time that you may have at home, about almost the whole world does something after school as to sports, getting a job, and much more. Sometimes people are busy all the time, like, people that do sports after school, some of them don't get out of there sports practice or games after sometime, mostly around 9:00pm. Personally, people are great for doing after school activities, but I'm not one of those people, and I will never be, unless its something with basketball, or an activity that I'd want to do on my free time, but it usually waists a lot of free time, and I'm one of those people that like to do homework, especially since I get a lot of it. So what I'm trying to say is, we have a life too, were not always just on our technology 24/7, were actually trying to do things that are good for us.

After school activities might give you some hard time, and might put pressure on you to do a certain something for them. Photographers job is to take pictures, and put it into a book, or a frame for people. Yearbook photographers take pictures, but what you don't know is, that they have to help the year book makers, and helpers to put those pictures into the yearbook, and the worst thing is, that they might not have enough people, some might be sick, or some might just not have enough time, and that can be bad sometimes. Lets say your a year book photographer, and your taking pictures, and your friend is sick, then you realize that you have to go through all the pictures you took, and pick which one is best, or which one seems yearbook appropriate. After you go through the pictures you then realize that all your friends in the yearbook photographer club are all either on vacation, or sick, so your alone, and you need the pictures to be in the year book by tomorrow, but you have no access to internet, because your friends are the ones that have the internet, and can turn in the pictures, then once everyone thought that they would get there yearbooks, they didn't, because all of one day and the day you needed your friends to be there. Let me tell you that, that is stressful, because some people could blame you, but it was never your fault. If this were me I would be so mad, because I would know I would get blamed on. So, being in an after school¬†activity can be stressful especially in one you know your gonna have a hard time in.

After school activities don't give you money, or necessities you need for that club, most schools won't give you money because they always need it for their own school necessities, and I think thats great and all, but think about the students that do sports, photography, and serve as student council, and do all of this work. People joined because they thought it was going to be fun, and they thought, oh I'm not gonna have stress this could be relaxing for me, but no, the school will give them so much to do. Lets go back to the year book photographers, they take so many photos after, or for clubs almost every week, and they get nothing for it, they dont even get a copy of a yearbook. The sport kids don't need money, but at least give them better gear for there own sport that they play. I think that the schools should put more money into sports, and people that need better necessities like the clubs and the people that are in school, after school for reasons that would be good. I think that people should stop worrying about there kids with after school activities and start to worry about the jobs they get, parents should have there kids working young for small amounts of money and work there way up the money that they get paid, kids should have a job around high school¬†time maybe in 9th grade even because whats gonna happen when your child doesnt get a job, the parents are still gonna have to buy them food, cook for them, and have them waist more electricity and also some water bills so i think kids should stop worrying no what to do and start worrying where their gonna work at.

Some might say its better for kids to do after school activities and I agree, students usually at middle school¬†should try and sign up for something that will benefit for them like, sports and maybe some extra lessons to keep up their grade up, or try out and be ahead of everyone else, now while that may seem bad its really not, because it's there choice if they want to take geometry one year and take algebra 2 in the summer, or after school everyday. They'll be on their way to getting a good job or even be being the next Albert Einstein, who knows? Now while that may be true some parents sometimes push there kids into taking those after school¬†activities, and thats always a bad thing because, I think that the parents should respect there kids opinion about doing an after school activity. I also know, I know, I don't want my mom screaming at me telling me what I can, or can't do.

In conclusion, doing an after school activity is all up to the parent and and student. In my opinion I wouldnt because of the time it takes, and hard times that it might bring you in like those photographers and sports people.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
776FBF88E6FF,"Welll its going to be ah good beefit but in the same time it's a bad benefit to doing class in the house .

(03/10/2020).

The oportunity the not miss one class and be in you house is the best thing the can happen to one school students, this benefist the school and the students beacuse they never going to miss one day of school and the homeworks and tests to. In the actually some kids miss the school for be sicks, some familiar pass away ,they in vacation and they not return in time to the country , they miss the bus school and they can't go to the school beacuse they not have car ,oh they wake up late. This is a benefit because they can learn about the class oh activity and not miss homework oh test and be prepare for the next class in the school, and be in his house relaxing and be in a safe place and always have ready you homework oh test to next class and its ah good benefits to the people ho its in the hospital and can go to the school for ah broken legh oh medical condition .

But not everething it's good about this idea some kids maybe oh actually they gonna stop going to the school and stay in his house and skiping the school. this its going to affect them beacuse they can't sociable with other people ,they can have ah computer oh in his house, they not have wife oh cellfone and other guys oh kids will skip the online class to and go play video games,and they parents are not gonna have idea about what his kid did oh do, and during the test they can copy using this class peapers oh using his fone to find out the answers. ( In my case i will always if they give me the opportunity to online classes i will always stay in my house relaxing in my bed when i listening the class ) but in the end this option of learn in his house have his good and bad bennefits (some school in the united states are not using this becuse they not have personal wedsites and can garanteed if the student are going to use this ) .

( I have one idea in how they can do this in ah good way. The students ho miss the school need to call the school and inform why they not going to the school and need the have a parent in his house, then they send them the link of the online class and notify the parent if they are doing work, oh they are skiping the online classes, and they can have ah limet time of online classes so they can be focus to his work and doit on time and when they are doing ah test they doing the test in a video coferincing with one teacher if they and not chating oh copy during the test. ).

My personal opinion:

In my opinion its ah good offer becouse sometimes i miss the school bus and i can't go to the school becuse i not have ah car and i always miss the class,homework and tests, and this can be help me a lot to have all the work in time and be prepare for the next day of school and be ready take the class oh to take one test .

one sad fact:

In the intere world some kids can have this oportunity to have online classes in some countries around the world they not have the tecnology to do that so if they miss the school one its like they are missing one day of his life and fact even they are kids ho not are going to the school bacuse the parents not have money to send them to the school ( yep in some countries the education cost money and they not have free schools like united states ) and they have to work in one short age to help his family in my country was like this thaks to good i was alow to go to the school thanks to my mother and come her to the united states so when i come to the school her in united states and i hear students said i hate the school and i wanna be in home i remember my country and i said thanks to this country for give me free education (even in her they do video school conferencing to the people ho not coming to the school and i said wow , Even they do that for the students, and the students are doing protest to have more off days so what i try to said is always thanks to you parents for the education they are give to you and thaks always to you country to give you free education to you can be some one in you future and have a nice work and never ask why i not have this. and always think some in around the world not have the stuff the you have and always thanks to GOD for the stuff you have ( I always do that wen i wake up).

Extra fact:

In some countries i the world like China,South Korea,Russia... etc, the education in vidio its ilegaly in all school this is bacuse they think the education its have to be like the oll days paepar pencil and uniform (some schools in united states more in the private schools) and they not use laptops to do classes the have to read every single book and the attendence its obligatory what i read if you miss the school in that countries they punch you in the hands with one metal stinck ( like in some countries in south america) and the leave detention in the school and you have to writte in 10 oh 20 pages the i have to come to the school every day . sometimes they stay in the school all day bacuese they need study for ah test.

The mask that apeared on Mars was first spotted in the year of 1976. I can strongly say that the face on Mars is not created by aliens. I know this because scientists figured that is was a butte or mesa- landforms that are common around the American West. Also when they shot the pictures it was taken during winter when it is normanly cloudly, not a good time to take a photo.

The face on Mars is not a alien creation, but is a Marian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. This implies that the science behind this, is that the landform on Mars is non other than a mesa. Scientist also know that mesa landforms are common enough, especially around Cydonia. This shows that the unusual formation was definatly a butte, but this one just happened to make it look like a face.

In 1976 a Viking shot a photo of a face like portrait. This was taken during winter a cloudy time of the year. This demonstrates that this picture is not the most reliable photograph. And so On April 5, 1998 a team of MOC researchers went out a took a sharper photo,much more reliable thean the original Vikings photo. This reveils that the landform was very much a natural landform. Though this rock formation did very much resemble a human head, We know that this mesa was created by shadows not aliens.

The face on Mars show us that things may appear different from what they seem. Next time lets just leave it to the experts to tell us the science behind things.     ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
CF7F36B7EA2E,"Dear Principle,

I have heard you have been considering a new cell phone policy. Cell phones at school are not only used as communication between friends but also for other reasons. Most kids do want to use cell phones for the sole purpose of communicating between friends outside and inside the classroom. However there is always the exception. There are also many other students that use their cell phones for the purpose of contacting their parents and letting them know about important information about the day.

For this reason I am suggesting accepting the first cell phone policy where students can still use their cell phones at the appropriate time.

First there are the unexpected events that occur throughout day to day. For a child who gets picked up daily by their parents, if an event occurs that restricts the parent from picking up their child that day the parent needs to contact their child and let them know about the situation. Usually the parent will call the school and have them let their child know about the change in events but the child is not always informed. Most parents will still call their child as a precaution because they want to make sure that their child is up to date about the situation.

Next there is a change in a school event that a student planned to attend. If there was an after school activity or program going on that a student planned to attend, but got changed due to various reasons, that student would need a way to contact their parent or legal guardian to come pick them up. These change in events can happen frequently due to weather, or other events that restrict the ability to have that certain event.

Lastly is for the purpose of communicating between friends. Cell phones are not an essential but can help student relieve stress and pressure from the school day. I understand about not letting them have cell phones in the classroom but there should be no problem for usage of the item outside the classroom. Many students want to have some sort of entertainment to occupy them when needed. This policy will let students have that entertainment and still focus on school work.

All in all, cell phones can be used for many different reasons during a school day. If its from unexpected events to just plain entertainment, cell phones serve a purpose in today's society. The first policy, like I have mentioned before, should be allowed due to many different reasons. I sincerely hope you can see my reasoning and make the right decision for this policy.

Sincerely,

54B9CFA95D80,"Fellow citizens, cars have become a major role in our daily lives. They have their many excellent uses, however there are advantages of limiting that usage. To name a few are, that it's enviromentally healthier and it's less money you have to spend on them. Now let me explain why it's a smart choice to take advantage of limited usage of cars.

Paris recently (according to source two article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer) came up with a brilliant idea of partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. They took days were only even or odd liscense plated cars would drive or they would suffer a fine. However public transit was free throughout the week. This promoted less congestion and smog which is much better for the enviorment by lowering the amount of pollution in the ozone layer. As well as a cheaper way to commute. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". This shows just how out of hand the smog had gotten but with limiting the amount of cars used they managed to clear over half of it! Making the world greener than before.

Meanwhile in places such as Vauban, Germany, the residents went as far as giving up there cars. (according to source one article ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"" By Elisabeth Rosenthal) About 70% of the residents no longer own cars because it's either too expensive to have one on the edge of town and it's generally forbidden in this experiment in the new distirct. They even go as far as to say that it's better without having one. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter,a resident in Vauban according to the article. People in general, especially the younger generations don't use cars or have liscenes in comparison to older people who are more likely to retain their liscenses as the age was shown in research. People now don't care as much as what cars are driven but are more focused to get from point A to point B, it's simply a means of transportation. (In source 4 article ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal).

When it comes down to it, cars are transportation, but there are plenty of other means of transport that are free or cheaper such as buses, trains, bikes or even car pooling. While at the same time creating less pollution and congestion, making it enviromentally healthier.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
D251CC495A0E,"Dear State Senate,

I feel that the way we, the people, vote today is very unfair. We should change the voting to popular vote for the president of the United States. The majority of people don't care about voting for the next United States prsident because they don't get to chose who will win. The people that get to vote for one's state might not think about what what the remaining others would want.

In source one, this section tells the reader what an electoral college is and how it works. Paragraph two sums up what this system is, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting if the electoral votes by Congress."" Basically what this paragraph was saying is that the people dont get to directly say who they want as president. The people of a state get to vote for who they want, but it is ultimately up to the state electors on who will get the vote from that particular state. There could be a ton of people voting for one president, and then there might be less votes for a president who may be even better. Ultimately what this system comes down to is the people don't vote for their next president. They are selecting a name that might not do anything to their country.

Source two talks about the electoral college and how the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. In paragraph nine,¬† the text says, ""... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters¬† would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.

Paragrapgh twenty-three, ""It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state- Democrates in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" If these people were to vote by the system we have now, their vote would have no effect. This leads to the people living in these states to not vote. They don't even pay attention to the campaign anymore. They know that they won't do anything to the votes or who will become president. They couldn't care less.

We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.       ¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
E21C97204867,"As school budgets are stretched, some schools are considering changes to the food offered in cafeterias. While this can be a good way to cut costs, there are also potential negative outcomes to consider. 

One outcome could be that students may be less likely to eat the food offered if they are not accustomed to the new items. If students don't eat the food served in the cafeteria, they may not be getting the proper nutrition they need throughout the day. Furthermore, if students are not fully nourished, it could potentially lead to poorer academic performance.

Another potential outcome is that the quality of the food offered may decrease, leading to unhealthy eating habits. Food that is low in nutrition and high in unhealthy ingredients can not only be detrimental to physical health, but can also impact students' mental health and wellbeing. 

Lastly, introducing new foods or changing the menu could cause disruption or even dissatisfaction among students. This could potentially lead to diminished morale and a less positive school environment.

There wouldnt be other students around to bring your grade down because there failing also kids focus more when there's no teacher around because they feel more comfortable.

In my option¬†it would cost less drama because other people wouldnt be with you to cause problems. because when you get in trouble you have to deal with the principle and you will most likely get suspended.

Also you wouldnt have to wake up at 6:00 AM every morning because its so stressful to wake up that early every day. Because if u wake up mad you're not gonna wanna do anything at school.¬†If i were able to control if we had to work from home i would do it because everything you do online is better because you can go back and check you stuff you don't have any body rushing. You and when u make videos for the class instead of presenting to the whole class because if you make a video you can mess up as many times as you want. But the thing is you are able to start over, rather than having to present to the class and mess up in front of everybody when you mess up in front of other people it is embarrassing.

If you are taking classes at home you will be able to eat what you want. Because the school food is nasty and unhealthy¬†and sometimes you go half of the day with out eating and everybody knows you cant focus on a empty stomach. So if decide¬†to eat you can leave in the middle of a test and come back and finish if your taking the class at home.

In conclusion, theses are the reasons i think students should be able to stay home and do classes everything would be so much easier for them and if all the students. Make it and pass they would thank the county for letting them take online classes and they wouldn't be showing up late because you can lay in bed and do your online classes if you really wanted to dont forget it would be less drama two because drama messes up your school work after all this the reasons i think students should be able to take online classes.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

BFD5F32AA3C2,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that people should make their own decisions instead of seeking guidance from experts. While experts may have knowledge and experience in their respective fields, they may not always have the best understanding of an individual's unique circumstances and goals. Additionally, relying solely on the opinions of experts can limit personal growth and development.

Firstly, experts may not always have the best understanding of an individual's unique circumstances and goals. For example, a financial expert may provide advice that is not tailored to an individual's specific financial situation. This can lead to poor financial decisions and missed opportunities. Similarly, a career expert may provide advice that does not align with an individual's personal values and interests. In these cases, it is important for individuals to make their own decisions based on their own research and understanding of their situation.

Secondly, relying solely on the opinions of experts can limit personal growth and development. When individuals rely solely on the opinions of experts, they may not develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary to make informed decisions. This can lead to a lack of personal responsibility and a lack of confidence in one's own abilities. On the other hand, when individuals make their own decisions, they have the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and grow as individuals.

Finally, experts may not always have the best interests of the individual at heart. For example, a doctor may recommend a treatment that is not the best option for a patient's specific health needs. This can lead to unnecessary suffering and a lack of trust in the medical profession. Similarly, a lawyer may recommend a course of action that is not in the best interest of their client. In these cases, it is important for individuals to make their own decisions based on their own research and understanding of their situation.

9FA8391D4B9E,"Dear Mrs. Principal,

I think students should have at least a B average to be on a sports team or participate in any other activity.

Here are the reasons why I think that and why it's bad to let students with bad grades join a team or activity.

The students might need to pay more attention in school, and sports or activities might distract them from doing their work.

I think the best solution is to only allow students with at least a B average to be on a sports team or do any other activity.

They shouldn't be allowed to unless they get their grades up higher than a C.

Kids might think that sports or activities are more important than school work, so they would just start to forget about school and not care about their grades.

They might start coming up with excuses for not doing their homework or being ready for a test saying, ""I had practice,"" or ""I was really busy last night.""

And then they are going to stop caring about their grades and how they do in school.

Students should only be allowed to be on a sports team or in any activity if they are trying their best in school and getting good grades.

You don't want kids to slack off and do poorly, do you?

I think not being on a sports team or doing any activity can hurt your school work and it will be harder for the kids to stay on task and focused.

Also, if you tell the students that have less than a B, that they aren't allowed to be on any sports team or participate in any activity unless they have at least a B, they might want to be on that team or in that activity so badly that they change their grades and do better in school.

Did you ever think about that?

And then the students can have fun and also have good grades.

I think that it's very important to get good grades because it depends on your life ahead of you in the future.

If you don't do well in school, it might be hard to get into a good college, or you won't even get into one at all.

And usually kids that start slacking off in middle school, don't do much better in high school and might even drop out which isn't the answer.

They could change into bad students and they won't know how to make the right decisions and they would fall into the trap of peer pressure.

When people grow up, whether they are good or bad, a lot of peer pressure happens and it might be really hard to say no.

I think that if you're well educated and you try your best in school, get good grades, and make good choices, you won't need to worry so much about peer pressure.

The kids that are the opposite and don't do good in school, don't care about their grades, and make bad choices, are going to get themselves in trouble.

Thank you for your concern and please think about not letting the students be on any sports team or activity while their grades aren't at least a B.

I appreciate it.

F8BD33BC0C9B,"Humankind has always been fascinated with the concept of cars. Motorized vehicles that effortlessly take you from one area to another when compared to more traditional methods such as walking. Everyone wanted a car for themselves to become a part of the innovation. But as time has passed, we now realized that it was naive of us to think cars were going to revolutionize transport, as some of the more simpler ways of transport (bike riding, bus) outshined car ownership in practicality and efficiency.

Now more than ever, alternative transportation methods are being promoted heavily in order to reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere. A shining example of this is in Paris, France (""Paris bans driving due to smog"", source two), where the goverment took the initiative to limit the usage of vehicles to reduce the amount of smog in the city.

Paris, one of the most idolized cities in the world, was at a point where the density of smog and pollutants in the air rivaled Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. However, after the driving ban in Paris, the city saw a drastic reduction in the amount of pollutants in the air, as it dropped down from 147 micrograms of particulate matter/cubic meter. Not only that, but Paris also saw an inprovement in car traffic, dropping down to 40 percent of what it originally was five days after the ban.

With all this in mind, how does this benefit the population without looking at the pollution reduction? This can also benefit us physically and psychologically. In Bogota, Colombia, a generally congested city, filled with traffic jams and other problems; Mayor Antanas Mockus promoted alternative transportation in the ""Day Without Cars event""(Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, source 3). In an effort to encourage public transportation in the city of 7 million inhabitants, Mockus promoted an event in which the only form of motorized transportation available was taxi cabs and bus rides. This mean that the people took the opportunity to bike, walk, hike from one point to another. Subsequently, this also indirectly promoted physical fitness and a stress release for people wanting to take the chance to enjoy their day. As Carlos Plaza evidently states that it is a great way to take away stress, while on a bike ride with his wife. Colombia has also opened up new bike path, parks, and sports centers, which is all the more proof that this initiative is promoting physical fitness and psychological wellness.

One could argue that this revolution of alternative transportation could have negative consequences on car industries and other businesses that rely on personal vehicle, and they wouldn't be wrong. But this phenomenon doesn't necessarily have to hurt anyone, as these same industries can promote their time and resources on projects that also promote alternative transportation. Just as well, in recent years, the amount of people getting driver's licenses and relying on personal vehicles has seen a significant decline, such as the amount of young prople driving decreaed 23 percent from 2001 to 2009, or when a study showed the amount of miles driven by the average American peaked in 2005 and steadily declined since then (The End of Car Culture, Source 4). People started to see the efficiency of alternative transportation, and capitalized on the opportunity to make transportation more accessible to everyone. Whether its from the expanding biclycle paths in New York City, to the Bay Area Rapid Transport in San Francisco, these are just a few examples of the steadily growing list of cities promoting more accessible transportation.

So with all of this in mind, there is irrefutable evidence that the more simpler methods of alternative transportation to limit vehicular usage is more efficient and practical. As seen in Paris where the city saw a significant drop in the amount of smog the city contained. Or when Bogota where an event that banned vehicular usage promoted physical and psychological wellness. People opting for alternative transportation is the global phenomenon that benefits us in more ways than we can imagine. There''s no doubt that the older, more traditional methods of transportation out perform personal vehicles in efficiency.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0

I have art school after schools ends and I need to be there on time to finish part of my art work that help me get in to college.

EAB3924FD98F,"Ugh, I know, right? Four years of high school seems like forever! But hear me out. I think it's a pretty good idea for students to take four years of high school instead of three.

First of all, let's talk about learning. I mean, who doesn't love learning? (Okay, maybe some people, but not us.) Taking four years of high school means we have more time to explore different subjects and really dive deep into them. Like, imagine being able to take an extra year of math or science or even art! It's like, we get to be kids for longer, and that's not a bad thing. Plus, we can take more time to figure out what we're actually interested in, and not just be stuck with the same old subjects the whole time.

And speaking of interests, have you ever tried to decide what you want to do after high school in just three years? It's like, impossible! You're supposed to figure out your whole future in like, 12th grade? No thanks. Taking four years of high school means we have more time to explore different electives and see what really interests us. Like, I might want to take a year of coding or photography or something. It's like, we get to be kids and try new things without feeling rushed or stressed.

And let's not forget about summer vacations and evenings with family and friends! Three years of high school means we have to cram all of our fun stuff into two summers, which is like, not a lot of time. But with four years, we have more time to relax and enjoy ourselves. We can take longer vacations, go on more adventures, and just chill with our loved ones without feeling guilty. It's like, we get to have a real life outside of school.

And lastly, let's talk about having time to do stuff. Like, I know I'm only 13, but I already have a ton of hobbies and interests, and I want to have time to pursue them all! Taking four years of high school means I have more time to join clubs, volunteer, or even start my own business. It's like, I get to be a kid and have fun without feeling like",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

87055E1EDAC2,"The Sun is blazing, the sky is blue, and school is out. What more do students want? Once summer starts school books are thrown to the back of the closet, never to be seen until the next year. This worries schools since when students aren't learning during the summer then classes have to be provided for students to relearn everything they forgot. This led schools to develop summer projects so that their students will learn during the summer. However, issues started to arise of how they should be designed. Some say teachers should design it and others say that students should design it. Although teacher-designed summer projects would help set guidelines so that the students can learn as much as they can, student-designed projects will let the students showcases their creativity.

When designing the summer projects, teachers most definitely would set guidelines for students to help them, when they get stuck. However, what teachers don't realize is that by setting guidelines they are really restricting the student's creativity. They are limiting what the students can do and for the students to get a good grade on the projects, they would base their entire project on those guidelines. Which would mean they aren't really learning. These set guidelines would correspond with the topics that the teacher assigns. The assigned topics would focus on the materials the students need the most help in. Which in reality is forcing the students to learn. When someone is forced to do something they aren't interested in doing, they wouldn't usually put their full effort in to completing that task. This is the same for students too. By forcing the students to do these projects and not letting them chose what topic to do, the students wouldn't put all their effort in the project. This represents that the students aren't actually learning. This would be the¬†opposite¬†effect of what the summer projects were intended to do.

If the students were to, however,¬†design the projects instead, then the issue of them not learning would be avoided. By making the students design their own projects, they are able to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills. Most students, during school, have a difficult time demonstrating what creativity they have. However, by giving them this chance to design their own projects the students can really put their full heart into it since they would actually have interest in the topic. By being able to design their own projects students can also develop new skills, like leadership. Leadership is when someone is able to take charge in a difficult situation. The students would be able to represent this when they have to take charge to develop their own project based off the topic they chose. Having the ability to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills, students would be able to fully grasp what their learning. Schools then wouldn't have to worry about assigning classes so the students can relearn everything they forgot, since when school starts in the fall students would be ready to tackle new topics.

When it comes to demonstrating why students should design their own projects, schools should look towards the science fair. The science fair is a student-designed project that every student has to do, at least once, in their high school or middle school life. The science fair makes students pick a topic that their experiment would be based off of. When picking the topic, the student is showcasing their creative side since they aren't restricted on what topic to pick. During the experiment process, students are able to develop research skills for when they have to write their background paper on their hypothesis. Since they would need to find respected¬†articles that relate to their¬†hypothesis.¬†Students would also be developing their leadership skills since when doing their experiment things can go wrong and they have to take charge and figure out why. At the end of the science fair process, students can then really grasp the understanding of the scientific design process and how to develop a well done experiment. This would all be possible since the science fair is a student designed project. If the teacher were to design the project and pick the topics, students would have never been able to fully understand the scientific design process.

Schools should make the summer projects student-designed since it allows students to showcase their creative side. Even if having them teacher-designed would help set guidelines the students can look back at when stuck. By having teachers design the projects, students are going to be restricted and aren't going to be able to really learn since they won't be putting all their effort into the project. This would all be avoided if students were to design the projects themselves, because they won't be restricted and instead they would put all their effort into the project. At the end, students would be developing new skills and getting to actually learn. A perfect example is the science fair, where students are made to design their own experiments so that they can understand the scientific design process and how to properly make a experiment. Schools should trust their own students for their own learning at certain times.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,6
CBDAC6EED622,"Dear Mrs. Principal,

I am writing you concerning our possible change in policy. I both agree and disagree with your idea on change the grade level average.

I disagree with you on this term: most of the students who participate in the sport activities have a grade level lower than your expectations. By changing this policy, you are eliminating most of the players who are committed to the sport activities. The majority of the students who also play sports try to keep their grades up, but have a hard time doing so because of the sports, yes. But this does not mean that the students don't care enough to learn. It might be that they do not understand what they are being taught, but they just don't want to voice that they don't understand. The change in policy will only make them feel panicked and their grades will drop even furthe. If they are given the chance to fully understand the lessons, like a private tutor, they will be able to get their grades up and keep them that way, hopefully getting rid of the shyness to voice their misunderstandings. Their performance in school and in the sport they play will be better if the policy is not changed.

I agree with you on this point, however: some students just don't care enough to learn. They would rather be out on the field or shooting some hoops. By changing the policy, you give them a reason to learn what they are being taught. If you eliminate the ability to participate in said sport, it will give them more time to focus on the schoolwork they need to get done. Once they do spend more time on their homework, they will be able to get their grade up to expectations, and hopefully keep it there once they rejoin the team. By having the policy changed their drive to learn will be increased, even if they dislike the idea, and it will help them later on in life.

One of the best ways to spend time outside is by exploring your surroundings. I live in a small town with a lot of greenery and parks, so I love going on walks or bike rides to discover new places. It's amazing how much you can find when you take the time to look around. I've found hidden ponds, secret gardens, and even a few cool caves near my house.

F160E7B1FD96,"As an 8th grader, I know that high school is just around the corner, and college is not too far away. It's important to start thinking about what I want to do after high school, and one career that has always caught my attention is being a lawyer. I want to learn more about this profession and what it takes to become one.

Researching different colleges and their requirements, I found out that most law schools require a bachelor's degree in any field, but some prefer candidates with a degree in a related field like political science or criminal justice. Additionally, law schools typically require applicants to take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and have a strong academic record. It's also important to have good grades in challenging courses, like advanced math and science, as these will help me prepare for the rigorous coursework in law school.

Staying out of trouble and creating a positive image around myself is also crucial. I know that lawyers are held to high standards of conduct and ethics, and any legal or disciplinary issues can make it harder for me to get into law school or practice law in the future. So, I need to make sure I stay focused and work hard to achieve my goals.

To learn more about the profession of being a lawyer, I've been asking questions and doing research on the job requirements, duties, and legal practices. I've learned that lawyers represent clients in court, help them navigate the legal system, and provide legal advice. They also have to stay up to date on changes in the law and regulations, and they often work long hours to meet deadlines and prepare cases.

First of all, when you try to change who you are to suit society, it's like, you're losing your identity. You're like, forgetting who you are and what you want, and that's, like, not a good thing. You should be proud of who you are, and embrace your uniqueness.

Also, when you believe in your goals, you're more likely to achieve them. Like, if you want to do something, and you're like, ""Yeah, I can do this,"" you're gonna work harder to make it happen.

I agree with the quote because unless you try to something you need to have pasion and focused in things that you can grow in life over things that you already mastered. You can grow beyond and over things that you already master and learn new things to keep growing not just staying in the same spot.

16759AEA250C,"Dear Principal,

Good morning! It has come to my attention that you are considering to change our school policy. If you haven't noticed, most of the students have a C average. Many students may be arguing that changing our policy is wrong; my argument is just the opposite. By the end of this letter, I'm sure that you'll be convinced that we should definitely change our policy.

Which is more important, grades or after school activities? Yes, students do like to play sports and do other activities, but does this mean they should let their grades go? I believe this is very wrong. But, this doesn't mean we should let the students stop what they love to do. Getting good grades is very important, and I believe parents would agree with me as well. I myself, am one of these people that like to get good grades. This is what being in school is about.

First of all, grades on a report card reflect what the student knows, and what they need more help on. I think that it's fair that students should at least get a B in school. If students want to play sports or do other activities, then they should learn to be good physically, as well as mentally. In America, it's all about equality and fairness. Your idea of changing the policy seems fair enough. I'm sure that when you change your policy, you'll see a great change on your students report cards.

When I was in Kindergarten, my parents would tell me school is fun. Now that I'm in 8th grade, you see that it gets a little more hard and boring. But, students can be more enthusiastic about school, when they feel how getting good grades feels great. I assure you, once students realize that they have to get their grades higher, to play sports or do other activities, they will learn that they can be both smart, and active.

Lastly, I hope that you'll consider the change in policy, because it will be a great help for students. Fair is fair, and getting at least a B to play sports, or do other activities will make their parents happy, and maybe they will be too. I want to thank you for taking your time to read my letter, and I hope you'll go along with changing our school policy. This will help our school achieve more, and make it a better learning experience for everybody.

Having cell phones in school isn't a good idea. They provide distractions, ways to cheat on assignments, and they could get stolen, lost, or ruined. Having cell phones at school can cause many problems.

They provide a plentiful amount of distractions. Students could be texting in class and not be paying attention to what the teacher is saying and it will affect test and quiz scores because students will not know what they are doing since their cell phone had their attention, not the teacher. If a cell phone starts ringing in the middle of class, the noise will distract other people in the room. Other students might know the song that is being played and start singing along and being obnoxious with it. A cell phone would also be a nuisance to teachers because if it is out while they are teaching, they have to confiscate them and it takes away from the time they have to teach.

Cell phones could mean cheating on assignments because another student who has already taken the test and knows all of the answers could text the answers to someone while that person is taking their test. A student could put the answers into their phone and look at it while they are testing. Students could also pass the phone with answers on it around to everyone else taking the test.

Cell phones could get stolen and cause fights. If someone who owns a phone leaves it for just a second, another student could take the phone. Then, the student who's phone was stolen could figure out who took it and get upset with the other person, possibly even causing a fist-fight. If someone's phone gets lost, parents could be very upset at their child. Also, students could have fights, oral and fist, about who's phone is better.

Students bringing phones to school and being able to use them is a very bad idea and could hurt the school by rupturing grades and the students themselves. Bringing cell phones into schools shouldn't happen, and I hope you see why.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
5E75902533E2,"Summer projects are normally always dreaded by students and pushed to last second to complete. These assignments are usually given with a rubric and step by step guide on how the project should be completed. So what would happen than if students were given the opportunity to come up with their own project to complete? A student-designed project would open a new creative outlet for kids, have a higher chance of actually being completed, and it would give the teachers a better understanding of what needs to be taught throughout the next school year.

Not every student learns the same way, some kids are audible learners, who can learn by just listening, where others need to be hands on and are very visual learners, who need to be able to see what they're learning. It's hard for teachers to be able to work around and create projects that can benefit every individual student. Student-led projects would allow each student to find and use their own strengths and weaknesses and work off of what helps them retain information the most. With very few structured rules, the kids can run with their crazy, out of this world, thinking that fades away as you get older. If anything was to come out of student- designed projects it would be the different approaches to go about learning, to help teachers creating projects in the future.

It's very hard for students to be motivated to do something given to them by a higher authority, normally kids are motivated by a single letter grade or by a percentage. There are some kids though that as great as the reward may be, if they arent interested in the topic, then the homework, project, or worksheet won't get done. With the choice for the student to create the project on their own, it's highly likely that it's gonna be something that interest them. If it's something they actually are interested in, the more willing they'll be to actually completing the assignment. Compared to teacher-designed projects, the student created projects have a higher chance of actually being completed. It's not necessarily driven by a letter or a number, but more by a student's want to learn.

Student-designed projects help teachers figure out what needs to be taught in the incoming school year. When teachers receive these projects at the end of the summer they can take a look and see what knowledge each child has on the topic at hand and what needs to be taught in the future. It almost saves time and energy for both the children and the teachers, who now can direct their energy to something that is new and or never been taught before. Every school year, for the first month or so, many teachers review lessons and topics that were learned the year before. That wastes a whole month that could have been devoted to teaching a new lesson or topic that may never end up getting taught or rushed through at the end of the year, due to time. Student-designed projects allows repetitive or rushed learning to never be an issue.

Overall, student-designed projects have many more advantages than teacher-designed projects. Letting students decide what and how they wanna learn opens a door for a positive learning environment. It helps put the joy back in learning and the educational system as a whole. Student created projects allow for kids to find their identity and learn new things about themselves, it encourages a greater probability in the projects to be finished and to the fullest potential, and it helps both the child and the teacher for the school year ahead. Student-designed projects are perfect for the future of education.",0,persuade_corpus,,0

8062CAE2DEEE,"Making a claim is something we do almost everyday in our lives. Many are proven false or true, many are too absurd to ever be true, many don't have actual support, and quite a few are actually good claims. A majority of these come from science, as claims are usually just explanations there, but there are some that are more in line with what we think is a claim. Some of those are for stuff like space, time, other galaxies, even other planets in our solar system. In this case, we're looking at a claim about why people are trying to learn about Venus, the ""Evening Star.""

Firstly, how about the claim itself, and how well does it end up? The claim is stating that Venus is a worthy target for studying, despite any of the dangers. The most suitable answer to this is curiosity. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" That is some pretty good evidence, and a later part in the article the claim is made in states that it will likely lead us into many other endeavors that are as equally intimidating. Good evidence, reasonable claim, it's all there.

Secondly, what else supports the claim, as well as my claim on it? Our past is still full of mystery, and yet we still pursue it. The past of another planet taking that role isn't too far off the charts. The last paragraph states that we will be led to more endeavors because of our curiosity, not just because we met the challenge. ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" We do it because we want to, because of how nature works. We set our goals, then strive to meet them. Even if the goals weren't set by ourselves, a goal is a goal, and striving to meet them is the best we can do.

Finally, what dangers are looked at, and what are some solutions? The article puts the dangers of Venus pretty well. Venus is inhospitable, with a very thick atmosphere, over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit at the surface, and much more pressure than the deepest parts of our oceans. What we have come up with to get past this so far is to stay a safe distance away and study the surface. New oppurtunities open up as machines get made out of different metals that melt harder, using different boards for electronics, or even going back to early technology and using stuff like gears. Mechanical parts don't need electricity, compared to the stuff we use today.

So, yeah, that about wraps up the stuff related to that claim. Venus may be inhospitable, but that doesn't stop our curiosity from asking questions and our determination from trying to answer those questions. The claim about Venus being a worthy pursuit? It turns out well, and is definitely a really interesting question to ask. While we may not think about other planets often, it is definitely very interesting to learn about places like this Evening Star.                                  ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
D6CF7CB72CAF,"Should summer projects be students or teacher designed? Students should have the option of being able to create their own project during the summmer because more than likely they will do what they have in mind rather than the teacher. Although students would most likely do the projects if its optional for them to do, teacher assigned projects would be more edcational for the students. If students are allowed to design their own project they will be more interested into what they are doing. Giving the option of allowing students would be more diverse in opinions and amazing different ideas. If the teacher assigned the summer project they may no be so much interested into what the project is on, but if they are able to come up with things it will be easier.

Students dont have alot of decison making when it comes to educational purposes. Students should atleast be able to design their own summer project, which of course would be educational related. All school year, they have to follow the directions and go by what their teachers tell them to do. So therefore, they should have the option of coming up with their own project idea. During the summer their are alot of adventures the students overcome, making a projects out of the cool things they did over summer would be a great summer project. Students dislike projects, but if they are given the option to free hand, they will be more than likely to participate. They will have a little more leadway and more options to base off of. School isnt fun and projects arent either, so make things better and let the students have the option to create their own summer project.

Teacher designed projects are not always so fun and interesting. School projects are usually ""one for all"" meaning everyone is assigned the same project. Futhermore, letting students design and present their own project would more rational. There will be more diverse opinions,so all the projects wouldnt be the same. It would be a variety of different project ideas. Nevertheless, while the teacher is grading this projects,he or she, wont be grading all the same thing, you will see different point of views and more creative ideas the students have come up with. Asigning a project on what the students did over the summer, or just letting them come up with things by themselves would be interesting for the teacher grading instead of grading the same thing over and over. Since students attend school all year and the only break they have is summer, they should be allowed to design an project for themself.

Student projects desinged from students will be more convincing to do. If students hear their teacher telling them she or he is asigning a prject they wont be as excitied. No one like projects, so therefore if they are giving the option to take it upon themselves to create a project they will most likely participate. When students think of projects, they think of dreadfulness, so letting them do a free project will be more interesting to them because they wont have to think about the if its right or wrong, its based upon them. The summer design project is an good idea for the students to do because most likely they will engage more since its more orientated with them and not the teacher just assigning a project to the students. For example, say if you are in school and your teacher says ""you all have an project coming up on family speices "" versus "" you all have a project coming up and you will be able to do anything on it as long as it is school appropiate. Which one sounds more interesting to you? Furthermore, the students have to be engaged to be able to want to do something. School isnt fun, thats why teacher and administrators should help the school be more interesting for the students.

Students should have the option because they are more than likely to do what they have in mind rather than the teacher. Teacher projects are not great all they time but letting the students have the option is more helpful to them. Students dont like school projects, but if they are given the option, the teacher would probably see more grades increasing and more particaption reports. You never know what students are capable of, but giving them the option of designing a project on their own would be great to also see their talents or on how smart they are.

People just throw things on the ground and kill our world, by not treating it right. I think we should all be apart of community service. It would help our school raise more money for more activities and we could help other people by making the world better for them. Some people laugh at people doing community service, but what they really should be doing is helping them. They know that doing things for other people, or the community, is the right thing. So i believe that our school should take a full day off, out side, help other people clean up streets, parks, and yards. It would be a lot of help, and even if we don't get paid, we all know we did the right thing. Our world could be a much better place than what it is now. We don't always have to depend on technology to do everything for us.

Whether women were with child, someone had a broken leg, or u could've been sick. Either way, they still kept going until the reached their destination.

You shouldn't expect someone to give cash right away either. Just because you help doesn't mean your lame, or stupid. It means that actually care about the ones around you. So i believe that our school should get up and make a change for once. There should be no more sitting around, doing things we already know, when we could out there, in the world, helping others, learning new things, and how all of this is useful to us.

3170B51DC0BE,"How would one feel if a teacher said that every student would be taking the exact same courses in high school? Everyone would feel very uncomfortable because they are forced to do something that they may not like. Well, this is the same scenario as whether the summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. These summer projects offer the students to test out their skills and find out what they are proficient at. Summer projects should be student-designed because they can choose projects/topics that they are familiar with. Unlike teacher-designed projects, student-designed projects offers a far more widespread of new opportunities.

My first reason to why summer projects should be student-designed is because they can choose projects/topics that they are familiar with. For example, in the summer between 7th and 8th grade, the Geometry HN teachers assigned the incoming students an essay about geometry where we could write about anything related to the subject. Since I was allowed to choose what to write about, I decided to find real life applications of math and I was able to correlate these applications with basketball, one of my favorite sports. I wrote about how the basketball scoring was related to addition, how the court dimension was related to surface area, how shooting the basketball at certain angles/distances helps the ball go into the net, and etc. People should expect students to succeed at student-designed projects because students can choose topics that they are good at. Another example,¬†in the summer between 8th and 9th grade, was when the students were given a book to read,

The Other Wes Moore . When school started, we had a Socratic Seminar about the book¬†in my English 9 HN class. However, most people either hated the book or did not read it because that book was not a fan-favorite genre among the students. I was not able to finish reading the book because the first page was so boring that I would have rather watched paint dry. If the students were authorize to choose their book, they would be able to pick books from their genres or even books that they can personally relate to.

My second reason to why summer projects should be student-designed is because, unlike teacher-designed projects, student-designed projects offers a far more widespread of new opportunities. If everybody was assigned the same area of science for the science fair, then everybody would do very similar projects. However, student-designed projects allows students to try out new things and figure out whether or not they are good at it. For example, when choosing my 6th grade science fair project, I was originally going to choose an area of science that I was already good at, biology. However, I wanted to challenge myself, so I chose to do a project that revolves around physics, balancing. After I executed this concept to my project, I knew that it would take a while because I was new to this field. Once everyone was done with their project and their presentation, the results came in and I ended up getting second place in the whole school. Student-designed projects encourages students to not shy away from trying new things. Another example, in the summer between 6th and 7th grade, was when students were given an essay prompt to write about rather than letting us choose our own prompt. The prompt was about ""would you rather be in jail for 10 years for a crime you didn't commit or would you rather commit a crime and live with the feeling that you could be caught anytime."" My friend, Generic_Name, was completely stumped on what to write because he was not very good at writing essays, which is why he took English 7 HN--in hopes of improving his essay-writing skills. He ended up failing that essay due to lack of freedom given by the teachers' choice of the prompt. If Generic_Name was able to choose a prompt that and not be limited to one, then he might have been able to succeed at that essay.

As a result, some people may argue that teacher-designed projects creates a fair environment to everybody because every student has to the same projects. However, all this does is encourage more cheating because if every student is given the same project, then students can ""work"" with their friends to finish this projects faster. For example, in the summer between 9th and 10th grade, the students were given the same Pre-Calculus HN summer packet. To finish this faster, my friends and I each did three pages (total of 15 pages) and sent the completed work to each other. We completed the packet in less than 3 hours and got full credit for it all because we had the same thing to do. If students have to same assignment as others, then they will easily take full advantage of it by ""working"" together. Whereas, if students are allowed to choose their project, but not be able to do something that has already been done, they every student will succeed.

In conclusion, student-designed summer projects prevents cheating, creates more and new opportunities, and allows students to choose what they like. If teachers design the projects, then they are basically controlling one's decisions because they aren't allowing the students to widen their skills. So, answer this question again: How would you feel if a teacher said that every student would be taking the exact same courses in high school?",0,persuade_corpus,,6

Hi.

I am an eighth grader at your school.

And I am going to propose an opinion on whether or not the whole school should be required to do community service or not.

My answer will be supported with examples and other forms of evidence.

I think that you should not make everyone do community service.

There are plenty of people who should do it and people who cannot do it.

Many teens these days play sports and have families to attend to.

Although everyone SHOULD do it, doesn't mean they can do it.

I, for example, can't because of baseball.

I play in two different leagues and I am trying out for the school team.

There are many others who are just like me and just can't even if they wanted to.

The people that do have time to do it are doing good for our society and so it does not mean that everyone must contribute.

Also, if you think about it, a lot of teens, especially eighth graders, will not want to do it at all.

Teens these days just aren't caring for our economy, society, etc.

And if you do not listen to me and make everyone do it anyway, there will be protesters and you never know what they might do to get you to stop it.

It is great if people want to do it but like i said before, not everyone wants to or they just cannot have the time to help out.

Thank you for taking your time to read my (hopefully convincing) letter to you.

And that you please consider the possibilities of what might happen if you do go through with your plan.

This is a debate that society will never truly know because there are too many reasons for both sides, The car could be faulty and crash and harm people, or the car will crash because the human operating this car wasn't paying attention at the right moment. The debate is endless and society will have to discover how to judge the situation. In the article it states: ""As a result, in most states it is even illegal to test computer-driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the DIstrict of Columbia have led the country in allowing liminted use of semi-autonomous cars"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming). This quote states that many states are creating laws about this topic because of the chances of accidents. If driverless cars are being prevented on roads in some states, then why should we take the chance in any other state?

The second reason is that they are just too exspensive. The cars will need to have special sensors to make them a hundred percent safe. This will be too costly and will take a toll in economic debt. The sensors will need to be placed in every road and this will be way too costly. The article sates this about sensors in roads: ""These smart-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too exspensive to be practical"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming). This statement makes a lot of sense especially since the debt is burrying our economy today. Also the other option is to have smart cars with 3D mapping sensors, but these cars will be too costly for many of the Americans today so there will still be accidents occuring. So the real answer to this is that driverless cars are too exspensive.

The third and final reason is will the drivers pay attention still? The cars may be driverless in many situations but the human driver is still needed in certain situations and these situations can be very dangerous. The article states that ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming). The impact can be very harmful and dangerous especially if the operater of a car doesn't pay attention when needed. If a driver dozes off because they think they won't need to pay attention then they could possibly run through construction, go around accidents or if the car malfunctions. The drivers will misuse their privliges with these cars and they will not be safe in our society.

The use of driverless cars are unsafe and too exspensive for society. The reasons kisted above state just some of the many reasons why driverless cars would be useless in todays world. The cars are not proved safe yet and they will be too heavily priced for everyone to get one. The use of these cars are useless until they are proven completely safe and they are cost efficient. The real question though is, would you want your parents, kids, or even friends to drive these cars if you knew they are not proven to be 100% malfunction free?   ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
AD2E56E68B84,"The Reason teachers do summer projects is so that students do not forget the things they learned during the school year.¬†Some people may argue that summer projects should be teacher designed because if everyone has the same project then it should not be a problem. I know that argument is wrong because I have done both student and teacher designed and the student designed was much easier to work into my summer vacation than the teacher's project. Over the summer projects should be student designed because the student has more freedom to do what they want with the project.

Student designed projects helps the student because the student knows how to fit a project for summer vacation. During summer vacation a student does not worry about his or her schoolwork they have learned during the year. I was a kid that had summer camps that took up the entire day, but since I had a student designed project I was able to finish it earlier. The student designed projects give more room for students to finish early and be creative. This freedom the student designed projects give is why teacher designed projects is a worse choice.

Some people seem to think that since all the students get the same project when its teacher designed that the project is easier to complete. Teacher designed projects do not account for any job/summer camp that the student would be doing. The projects also ignores the chance that a student could be travelling to visit relatives for an extended time. Teacher designed projects are typically time consuming, harder, and leave less room for creativity. The students working on the project would be less likely to work on it since the subject the students are given are not interesting to them. I know this because in 7th grade many kids did not turn in their summer reader assignment because they were either too busy or too unintrested in the subject entirely.

Students given the over the summer projects should be able to design the project because there is more freedom and interest in the project itself. People that disagree could say it's easier because the project was made by a teacher, but the same people do not account for interest, summer jobs, summer camps, or any other activity that would take time away from school work. If students had control over the summer projects then even their grades would be boosted.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

Maintaining individual identity is super important, like, really important. It's like, the key to being successful and happy in life.

There are many successful people from around the world who are admired for their achievements. These individuals possess qualities such as determination, hard work, and perseverance that have helped them reach the top of their respective fields. One such person is Oprah Winfrey, an American media executive, actress, talk show host, and philanthropist. Oprah was born into poverty in rural Mississippi, but through her determination and hard work, she became one of the most influential women in the world.

Another successful person is Elon Musk, an entrepreneur and business magnate who has revolutionized the technology and automotive industries. Musk was born in South Africa and immigrated to Canada and then the United States, where he pursued his dreams of becoming an entrepreneur. Despite facing numerous obstacles and setbacks, Musk persevered and became one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world.

However, immigrants face significant difficulties when entering the United States. Many immigrants face language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination, which can make it challenging to integrate into society. Additionally, the path to becoming a U.S. citizen can be lengthy and complex, requiring immigrants to go through a rigorous process that includes passing a citizenship test, demonstrating good moral character, and being able to speak English.

Despite these obstacles, many immigrants have overcome them to succeed in the United States. For example, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, immigrated to the United States from the United Kingdom and overcame poverty and depression to become one of the most successful authors in the world. Similarly, Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, immigrated to the United States from Russia and overcame language barriers to become one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the tech industry.

Hard work and perseverance are key factors that have helped many immigrants achieve their goals.

D37412D51517,"""Alright class, you have a summer assignment that you will need to complete by the start of next school year.""

For many high school students, that quote is often what teachers will say to them at the end of the year.

It is not uncommon for a teacher to give out a summer assignment, especially in math or AP, or Advanced Placement, courses.

These projects can help to prevent loss of knowledge during the summer months, while students are not in school, or even just help the student to warm up their brain.

These projects should be teacher-designed, because student-designed projects will likely not help learning much, it makes grading easier on the teacher, and it helps the students to know what to expect from the class.

Students, just as electricity, will pick the path of least resistance.

That means that students will almost always choose the easiest way to complete an assignment.

That is one of the reasons that students will cheat.

I know a few friends that will cheat on most of their assignments, just because it is often easier than doing the work.

Because of that, the projects that students choose to complete will not be beneficial to their learning.

The student-designed projects would instead be ones that are the easiest to complete, not what benefits learning for the student.

For example, when students are told to make a story using certain elements of their choice, most students will only use those elements that are simplest and nothing more.

Because of that, the students may not get as much experience of writing a story with more complex, yet more beneficial elements.

If students are told to do a summer project, that they have the choice as to what to do, then they will choose what is easiest and not most beneficial to their learning.

If instead a teacher decides the project, then the student will have to use those more beneficial elements.

Also, if the teacher has to make how¬†the students create their projects so complicated, then the teacher might as well just create the project.

Whenever I have to do a project that involves multiple different choices, and the rubric is very vague as a result, I often can not tell if what I have done is an A+ work.

I specifically had to do a project on

The Catcher in the Rye , where I had to choose between multiple choices including an essay or various different visual projects.

The rubric on that wasn't very helpful when I was trying to figure out if I had done an A+ work, because it did not include much specifically about the project that I chose.¬†While that might be fine when I already know the teacher, so I can ask them, it would be much harder during the summer to know if it is excellent work.

Because of this, the students would either just not care that much about the project and just do what they think is the bare minimum, or they would be pressed into doing two miles instead of the only one mile needed for the project.

While this may be beneficial to the learning sometimes, it would also create much stress that would hinder the student's learning as well as life.

Along with this, because of the vague rubric, the teacher may have a different idea of what constitutes a good project than the student.

If the project is designed by the teacher and the rubric is more specific, then that discrepancy does not exist.

And then, because the rubric is more specific, the teacher would be able to grade it on more objective rather than subjective elements, meaning that all the teacher would have to do is follow a checklist to grade it, rather than vague guidelines as to what to look for.

This would make teachers lives easier, especially just after getting back from summer break.

Another benefit with the teacher-designed project is that it allows the students to know what to expect from the class.

For example, when I was in AP World History, I had to outline the first three chapters of the textbook as a summer assignment.

It was very long and specific work, but it helped me to learn about how the class was going to be a lot of outlining, as well that the class would have most of the notes done outside of class.

If a teacher were to assign a project that involved coloring and such, then the student would be able to reasonably guess that the class would have a lot of coloring and drawing.

Or if the assessment were to be that the student should read and annotate

The Crucible , then the student would expect that there would be a lot of reading and annotating in that class.

If the project were student designed, then the student would not have that advantage of knowing what to expect in the course.

A student may realize when doing the summer project that the class would be far too strenuous for them, if so, then they can change their class to an easier class before school starts.

Students do not always pick the easiest projects, so it may not be the most beneficial for their learning to design their own.

The lack of specific guidelines on the project may make it harder on the teacher to grade, as well as harder on the student to know what is the work needed to get the highest grade.

As well, the nature of the project may give the student insight into what the class is going to be like.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student designed, because students will not pick projects helpful to their learning, teachers and students can have an easier time knowing what is going to get the highest grade, and it helps the student to know what the class will be like.

After all, the teacher is the one who is teaching the class.",0,persuade_corpus,,4

fb35b978,"In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards limiting car usage in communities around the world. This shift is driven by various factors, including the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote alternative modes of transportation. Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The passage set highlights that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars produce pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds, which contribute to smog and respiratory problems. The passage set gives examples of cities like Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and create healthier environments for people to live in.

Limiting car usage also has benefits for individuals. Not owning a car can be liberating and lead to a less stressful lifestyle. In the passage set, residents of Vauban, Germany, express their happiness at not owning cars, stating that they feel more relaxed and at ease. This is because car ownership comes with various costs and responsibilities, such as maintenance, insurance, and finding parking spaces. By limiting car usage, individuals can save money and reduce the stress and hassles associated with car ownership.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and walkable communities. The passage set mentions the trend of making suburbs more accessible to public transportation and placing stores within walking distance. By designing communities in this way, we can reduce the need for cars and promote healthier and more active lifestyles. Walking or cycling as a means of transportation also has various health benefits, such as increased physical activity and reduced risk of chronic diseases.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that benefit both individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more sustainable and livable communities. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to embrace this movement and prioritize smart planning that limits car usage in order to build a more sustainable future.",1,radek_500,,1

7C08DA95AE9A,"After School Homework Club: A Pathway to Enhanced Student Achievement

Introduction

As an eighth-grade student, I have observed that many students struggle with completing their homework assignments. This is not only a problem for individual students but also for the school as a whole. To address this issue, I propose the establishment of an after school homework club that would provide a supportive and structured environment for students to work on their assignments. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of starting an after school homework club, provide suggestions for its implementation, and address potential challenges that may arise.

Benefits of an After School Homework Club

1. Improved Academic Performance: By providing a dedicated space for students to work on their homework assignments, the after school homework club can help improve their academic performance. This is because students will have access to resources, guidance, and support from their peers and teachers.
2. Time Management: Many students struggle with managing their time effectively, leading to procrastination and poor academic performance. The after school homework club can help students develop time management skills by providing a structured environment for completing homework assignments.
3. Socialization: Homework can be a tedious and solitary task, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their peers. The after school homework club can provide an opportunity for students to socialize and collaborate with their peers, making the homework process more enjoyable and engaging.

Suggestions for Implementing an After School Homework Club

1. Teacher Involvement: Teachers play a crucial role in the success of the after school homework club. They should be involved in the planning and implementation of the club, as well as providing guidance and support to students.
2. Resource Allocation: The after school homework club should have access to resources such as computers, textbooks, and study materials. These resources can be provided by the school or donated by parents and community members.
3. Time Management: The after school homework club should have a set schedule for completing homework assignments. This can help students develop time management skills and ensure that they are making progress on their assignments.
4. Peer Tutoring: The after school homework club can provide an opportunity for peer tutoring, where students can help each other with their assignments. This can be facilitated by teachers or by having students take turns leading study sessions.

F97EF0C23821,"Dear senator, I believe the Electoral College System is wrong.

In source number 2, Bradford Plumer states, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."". In other words, your vote is basically in the hands of someone else, and hopefully they vote for who you want what's even worse is electors are picked on at state conventions, sometimes state party's central committee, or even sometimes the presidental candidates, so you, the citizens don't get to pick the elector. Voters can not always control who their electors vote for and voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiate.

Moreover, in source number 2, Bradford Plumer states, ""The single best arguement against the electoral college is what we might call the diaster factor... state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people...electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."". Furthermore, this shows how the citizens of the United States of America really don't have a direct, liberal,voting system to choose who they want to won the election because at anypoint the electors can just go against what the citizens want and vote for who they please.

Lastly, Plumer states, ""the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states, candidates don't spend time in each state because they know they hvae no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."". Basically,this is saying that small states don't get to see campaigns or any of that because they're small states so they don't evem get a visit from the elector.

Overall, The electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. We should all have the right to vote for who we want directly and not have to go through electors which there is a very high chance they might change their minds and vote for the other party.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

In my opinion,driverless cars are a wonderful invention. As it is commonly known,there is a ridiculous amount of c02 polluting out air. I think that lower amounts cars out driving would improve the air quality and the health of wildlife in the area. Drivers may become bored more easily when driving because they are not focusing on driving but in my opinion even this is a positive factor. I say that its a positive factor, because people tend to get distracted while driving which could cause crashes. Car wrecks are completely avoidable,and I think should make changes in technology to prevent occurences like that.

All in all,I think that self driven cars are a positive innovation. I hope to see them on the road soon.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

I think that policy number 2 is a good policy because if you allow students to bring cell phones to school then they will not only use them in lunch or passing periods i think they will be using them in the classrooms too. I think that if you allow them to bring cell phones to school then they would start using them in class too and then they wont be able to learn anything if you allow them to bring them. Also, i think they would be using them all around the school and they don't turn them off they just put them on vibrate or they silent mode them. I think it would be good if they bring cell phones but then they might get too excited then they're going to start using them every time, but i also think some should bring them because sometimes they need to call they're parents after school but sometimes they could get out of hand. They can also be prank call people or they can cyber bully someone and i know that, that wont be good for our school. They wont be learning anything if you allow them to bring cell phones because maybe when they are taking test they text each other the answers or tell each other to help. I mean bringing cell phones isn't bad but what would the consequences be if you let them bring they're cell phones? Well i think some of the consequences can be they can get lower grades, they can cheat, they can be using them in class or even cyber bully someone! I don't think they should because they will be using them all around the school and that will be a bad thing.

CB892FB55B59,"Hey, so for this essay, I'm gonna talk about how important first impressions are and why you should always show your best self at the start. Like, think about it, when you meet someone new, you only get one chance to make a good impression. It's like, the first few seconds of a movie, you gotta hook 'em right away or they're gonna lose interest.

So, first impressions matter because they set the tone for how people perceive you. If you come off as cool and confident, they're more likely to think you're cool and confident too. But if you come off as awkward or boring, well, you get the idea. And once people form an opinion of you, it's hard to change it. Like, imagine if you had a bad first impression with someone and then you tried to make up for it later. It's not gonna be easy, right?

One reason why first impressions are almost impossible to change is because of something called confirmation bias. It's when people tend to believe what they want to believe, even if it's not true. So if someone has a bad first impression of you, they're gonna be more likely to notice all the times you mess up or do something stupid, and less likely to give you the benefit of the doubt. And that's not fair, but it's just how people work.

Another reason is that people tend to base their opinions on the most recent thing they've experienced with you. So if you have a bad day or make a mistake, that's gonna be what they remember about you, even if you've been acting cool and confident the rest of the time. And that's why it's important to always be on your best behavior, because you never know when someone's gonna be paying attention.

Finally, first impressions can be hard to change because people tend to be creatures of habit. Once they've formed an opinion of you, they're gonna stick to it, even if you start acting differently. So, if you're always trying to prove yourself to someone, but they're just not gonna see it, then it's gonna be hard to change their mind.

A9F7B20A9483,"Title: Minister Winston's Selfless Acts of Kindness in the Community

Introduction:

As an 8th grader, I find it inspiring to learn about individuals who make a positive impact in their community. Minister Winston, a local religious leader, is one such person who has been making a difference in the lives of many. Through my research, I have discovered the various ways he helps others, and I believe it's essential to highlight his selfless acts of kindness.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Working in a Group:

Minister Winston's efforts are not limited to helping individuals; he also works with a group of volunteers to achieve common goals. While working in a group has its advantages, such as sharing ideas and dividing tasks, it can also have disadvantages, like conflicts and communication issues. However, in Minister Winston's case, his ability to bring people together has led to more significant accomplishments.

Benefits of Immigrants Coming to a New Country:

Immigrants face numerous challenges when moving to a new country, but Minister Winston's organization helps them overcome these obstacles. The benefits of immigration include cultural diversity, economic growth, and new ideas. By providing language classes, job training, and emotional support, Minister Winston's organization helps immigrants integrate into their new community.

Challenges of Learning a New Language:

Learning a new language can be challenging, especially for adults who may feel embarrassed or intimidated. Minister Winston's language classes provide a supportive environment for immigrants to learn and improve their language skills. Through his program, they can overcome the difficulties of language learning and become more confident in their abilities.

Everyday Activities Helping Language Learning:

Minister Winston's program is not limited to formal classes; he also encourages everyday activities that can help with language learning. For example, watching TV shows or movies in the target language, listening to music, or participating in cultural events can all be valuable language learning tools. By incorporating these activities into their daily routine, immigrants can improve their language skills in a fun and engaging way.

If i saw someone with a phone out i would get mad and might give the people a talking to also i might even say i need your phone fro the rest of the day. Tell them i will not give your phone back the next time and i will call home if i have to. Now i would make it a law not to have phones with students and also band the phones.

llama_70b_v1750,"Okay, so like, there's this big debate goin' on about how video games can like, affect our behavior and stuff. And, like, some people think that they can make us more violent and stuff, but I don't really think that's true.

First of all, like, video games are just games, you know? They're meant to be fun and entertaining, not to teach us how to be violent or anything. Sure, some games might have violent content, but that doesn't mean we're gonna go out and start killin' people or whatever. I mean, come on, most of us can tell the difference between a game and reality, right?

And also, like, video games can actually be good for us in some ways. They can help us relax and de-stress, and they can even improve our hand-eye coordination and problem-solving skills. My friend's little brother, he's like, really into those first-person shooter games, and he's gotten really good at them. But he's not, like, violent or anything, he's just really good at the game.

Plus, like, there are so many other factors that can contribute to violent behavior, like, you know, mental health issues or a bad home life. It's not fair to blame video games for something that's way more complicated than that.

But, like, on the other hand, I guess it's possible that some video games could have a negative impact on certain people. Like, if someone's already got some anger issues or whatever, maybe playing a violent game could make them feel like it's okay to act out in real life. But that's not the game's fault, it's just, like, a coincidence or whatever.

So, overall, I don't think video games can make us more violent. They're just a form of entertainment, and it's up to us to decide how we want to act in real life. We can't blame games for our own problems, you know? That's just, like, not fair.

899F478E9672,"NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circiling Mars and snapping photos of possible laninding sites. It spotted what looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. There are many conspiracy theorists that think this is proof of life on Mars. I disagree. The article states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" The face like shadows that were captured on Mars can be compared to landforms on Earth. I think that what is thought to be a face, is just a hill-type mass with shadows that look like a face at certian angles. The article also says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeares on JLP web site, revealing . . . a nautural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" So what this means is that the landform has nothing to with life on Mars, just the planet itself. When NASA released the picture, they captioned it, ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" I personally think that what they had captioned the photo is all you need to know about what it is, a huge rock foundation. If what NASA captured was an actual aliens face, they claim they would release that information because it would do so much good for them.

70cd1937,"Dear Senator Nelson, In recent years, many people have called for the change of the presidential election process. Specifically, the Electoral College. Many consider it a pointless, unfair, and archaic system that denies the people the liberty of choosing their president. However, I believe the Electoral College is a necessity in modern America. Although it is as old as the country itself, it is still relevant and useful today.

The Electoral College ensures the outcome of an election. Without the Electoral College, the election may possibly need multiple reruns as a result of a tie in the popular vote. According to ""Does the Electoral College work?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president"". With that few of electors, it reduces the chances of a tie occurring. Although it can happen however, it's not probable. For example, if two candidates ever had a tie among the popular vote, it could be resolved within the college because of the way the slates of electors are divided up among the states. Some critics of the college say that this systems takes the control out of the peoples hands and denies them the right of choice. However, you have to remember that the people elect a slate of electors to vote for their candidate. That means that even though the College ultimately decides the president, the people still have someone to represent their candidates.

The Electoral College is also a necessity because it forces the candidates to face issues the people care about and to appeal to the masses. According to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: 5 reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So, a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pluralarity in those states"". This means that in order to win the popular vote and get a chance to win within the Electoral College, a candidate must appeal to the country, not just a particular set of voters who may have different views on politics than the majority of voters. Some people say that a candidate may try to appeal to a set of voters but in the end just use them in order to win the presidency. To that I say this. As a candidate, your ultimate goal is to serve two full terms as the president of the world's leading superpower right? Why would a candidate want to lie and jeprodize their chances at doing what they feel is right for the country?

In Conclusion, the Electoral college must not be done away with. It is a necessary tool to maintain fairness among the candidates and the election process. We have checks and balances among the government so one branch of government may never gain more power over the others so why not supervise the most important process in government? If you take anything at all away from this letter, please let it be this. The Electoral College is a staple in American politics. Without it, we would be denying our country the right to a fair election.",0,train_essays,,1
6895596AF3BD,"Dear Senator,

I don't think that we should keep the Electoral College because I truly believe that as the people of our country, we should have the freedom to vote for whom we think best fits the role of our president. I'll tell you why.

I have read this passage about three times in a row and I've gotten a better understanding of how the Electoral College works. I can understand an opinion that thinks the Electoral College is great and I'm sure it's a little less complicated and such but it's not quite fair to certain people in small states, etc. There are people who don't even see a point in voting now because they know that their vote will most likely not matter. As stated in

Source 3: In Defense of the Eletoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, paragraph 23,

""

It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state--Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing thier vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..

""

I strongly disagree with people in our country feeling this way. We are together as a country. Everyone's votes should matter. We are all here as one. People will have less and less interest in voting and we will go nowhere. I believe that the people should fully understand the process and not only that. Understand who is about to become president. In the country that we the people live in. Know this persons values, are they worthy? Know the lengths that they will go for our people. People should not feel that because they're in a small state, their vote doesn't matter. It should not be this way. I do believe that voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election but don't you think that everyone should be involved and that everyone should be informed or even have an opinion on what is about to happen? I feel that there are some people who are not fully understanding the system. As said in

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong, paragraph 10,

""

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.

""

Do the people even know who these electors are? Who picks them anyways? I understand that it depends on the state but do they know that? I also read that voters can not always control whom their electors vote for. Also that sometimes, voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. This is what I mean by people not fully understanding.

This is just my opinion followed by some evidence and explanation. Maybe you could see from my point of view and anyone who has a similar one.

Dear Senator I strongly suggest you on changing to election by popular vote and getting rid of the Electoral College. As you can see on the quote above people really don't like the Electoral College. This would be a very wise decision because the Electoral College is very old and unfair and it cause many crisis to happened.

First and foremost the Electoral College is very old.

It states in the article ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong"" ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

This quote explains how the electoral college is getting old and unfair so we should start fresh with a new change from electoral college to popular vote. Also the electoral college sometimes causes many crisis.

It states in the article "" The single best argument against the electoral college is that we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the century; the system allows for much worse.""

This quote explains how the electoral college caused a fiasco in 2000 because of the electoral college and if we don't get rid of it we could have another one of these crisis.

On the other hand the electoral college should not be taken away because our founding fathers established it.

It states in the article ""Source 1: What is the Electoral College?"" ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""

This quote illustrates how the electoral college is suppose to help us and noy hurt us. Also our founding fathers established so they were just trying to get everything in order and have peace with everyone.

Although the electoral college is very unfair because of the winner-take-all system.

It states in the article ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong"" ""At the most basic level, the electoral coolege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state. canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on only the tight race in the ""swing"" states.""

This quote explains how the electoral college is unfair and doesn't give chances to other states that supposively have no chance on voting for that certain canditate.

All in all Senator the electoral college must be abolish. Not only does it create many disasters, but it is very unfair to us citizens. The electoral college is very old and we should give a break. We could start with something fresh like the popular vote and see how it turns out. As you can see there is many evidence on how the electoral college is bad and that you should give the popular vote a chance.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7

llama_70b_v1754,"Climate change is real and its effects are already being felt. Rising sea levels, more intense natural disasters, and changing weather patterns are just a few examples of what we're seeing. The question is, what are we going to do about it? In my opinion, governments need to take immediate action to address this issue before it's too late.

First of all, let's talk about why climate change is such a big deal. The science is clear: human activities, like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which are causing the Earth's temperature to rise. This warming is melting polar ice caps, raising sea levels, and changing weather patterns, leading to more intense natural disasters. If we don't do something to stop it, the effects of climate change will only get worse.

One of the biggest reasons we need governments to take action is that climate change is a global problem. It's not something that one country or even a group of countries can solve on their own. It requires coordinated effort and cooperation from around the world. Governments have the power to implement policies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in clean energy technologies. They can also provide funding for research and development of new technologies that can help us mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another reason governments need to take action is that climate change is already having a disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities. Rising sea levels are threatening coastal communities, and more intense natural disasters are affecting communities that don't have the resources to recover from them. Governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens, and that includes taking action to address climate change.

There are also economic reasons why governments should take action. The cost of climate change is already being felt in terms of property damage, lost productivity, and healthcare costs. According to a report by the International Monetary Fund, the economic impact of climate change could be severe, with losses estimated in the trillions of dollars. By taking action now, governments can help mitigate these costs and prevent them from getting worse in the future.

Finally, taking action on climate change can create new economic opportunities. Investing in clean energy technologies can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, the renewable energy sector could support up to 46 million jobs worldwide by 2050.

Of course, there are those who argue that taking action on climate change will hurt the economy. They say that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will lead to higher energy costs and reduced economic growth. But the science doesn't support this. In fact, studies have shown that taking action on climate change can actually boost economic growth while reducing emissions.

In conclusion, climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate action from governments around the world. The science is clear, the impacts are already being felt, and the economic costs are mounting. Governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens and take action to address this global problem. By investing in clean energy technologies and implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, governments can not only mitigate the effects of climate change, but also create new economic opportunities. It's time for governments to take action and lead the way in addressing this critical issue.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The issue of climate change has become increasingly important in recent years.

EC8590A774E6,"Hey there!  So, you know how sometimes you feel really good about yourself, like you can take on the world? That's called self-esteem, and it's super important.  Like, it can make you feel more confident and stuff. But, have you ever wondered why it's so hard to keep that self-esteem up? Like, why do people's opinions matter so much? And how can we actually be ourselves and still feel good about it?  Well, let me tell you, it's not always easy, but it's definitely worth it.

First of all, self-esteem is like, the ability to feel good about yourself, even when things don't go your way. It's like, having confidence in yourself, even when you mess up. And let's be real, we all mess up sometimes.  But, when you have good self-esteem, you can bounce back from those mistakes way faster. It's like, you don't let one little mistake define you as a person. You're like, ""Oh, I made a mistake? No big deal, I can do better next time!"" 

But, here's the thing, other people's opinions can really affect your self-esteem. Like, if your friends are always making fun of you or if your parents are always on your case, it can make you feel like you're not good enough.  It's like, they don't understand that we're all imperfect, and that's okay. We're all gonna make mistakes, and that's how we learn and grow. 

So, how can we improve our self-esteem? Well, one way is to focus on our strengths. Like, what are you good at? What makes you unique?  Maybe you're really good at drawing, or maybe you're super smart in math. Whatever it is, embrace it! Be proud of yourself and your abilities. 

Another way is to be yourself. Like, don't try to be someone you're not. It's okay to be",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

0C0C473FA794,"I truthfully believe this is not created by aliens. Even if the artifact was created by aliens we have no proof of actually seeing them. NASA denies that there is not any other logical proof of aliens, but NASA's budget really wishes there was an ancient civilization. It would mean great publicity and further exploration into science. As a scientist learning about this you may believe anything within earshot. Whatever could seem logical, could not really be what is really right. Confusing as this argument sounds, I really believe that aliens never would have made this artifact. Could something like this happen? Do they really exsist?

Nature is different on mars, how is this effective? Mars has different climates and weather storms that we don't experience on earth. Maybe, the ""face"" is a weathered rock and when shadows cross over it it really looks like a face. Does that seem truthful enough to you? Or even believable? Sometimes when we look at clouds they can be different shapes as what we think they look like. To you, this is artifact that needs further examination. If we could excavate it from Mars we could further our studies on what truly made this rock really look like a face. How could this happen, you may ask? The cost of getting another spaceship to Mars and having a crew does cost alot of money, I understand. NASA made the last possible missions come true, would we be putting the people in that spaceship in danger?

Mars really isn't that safe, that may be why people dont life on Mars without a suit and oxygen tank. Because something bad could really happen up there, and we need contact with earth to tell whats going on. That may put people in danger sending the crew up there. We can only think and hope that the artifact was created by aliens. The face on Mars is an icon for magazines and movies like ""The Martian"" and books like ""The Lunar Chronicles"". A single dicovered thing can turn sellers into money-makers easliy. All these fanatsy in books and movies, really can make us believe what we believe.

Pictures say that shadows make it look like a face. To me the artifact looks like a giant rock, with holes in it. When the shadows of clouds do come along it looks like a face. We may reallly never know who, what, or how this confusing landmark was made. The whole solar system moves around the sun, sometimes they said that they couldnt find Cydonia. Its stuck behind the cloud storms, but this face is really a natural landform on Mars. Now pictures can be photoshopped can't they? If this really was a face why does it look the way it does? From early pictures they turned out blurry and you cant really see the face. I still dont see the face.

Some say the camera doesnt lie, well in this case it may. If aliens were there making these faces wouldnt there be more? it would be a culture to them, or a ceremonial thing. We may never know. All these questions have no answer to them. What is really happening on Mars? Why were the artifacts made, but its really something we will never understand.

If aliens did make the artifact where are they? Wouldnt we see something about them or some weird signals coming from them? Aliens dont really exsist, as much as the subject wraps around our brains, it really leaves us clueless on what we know and what we dont know. Since we really have no proof, I believe that aliens did not make this artifact, found on Mars. I could be wrong to some people, but i believe my claim is true. There really may be a civilization on Mars if we could really think about it and further our studies. But for now i believe this artifact is really just a weathered rock on the face of Mars.

C68A69F99946,"At some place like NASA, when they are building these multi-million dollar space crafts, do you think they have one person who designs everything, checks his own work once and then they send these ships into space? The answer is no. They have a bunch of different people checking their numbers and working on these projects because it's the most effective way. Talking to more than one person before making a decision can help you when trying to solve a problem, research, or at your job just like they do at NASA.

The first way asking multiple people can help you is if you are trying to solve a problem. In school if we have a hard homework assignment I'll usually text two of my friends in that class. One time one of them was out of town, and my other friend and I both got a question wrong. We both then got points taken off. If we would have had a third person to check the problem we probably could have figured it out. If you are trying to solve a problem by your self, you can never guarantee you'll get it right.

The next way asking multiple people can help you is when you are researching something. If you have a topic you are really interested in you will usually read more than one article or book about it. I love to read, and I love sports, so when there if there is some big nationals trade I'll read a few articles about the new players or just about the trade. If there is a paper I have to do for school I'm also going to check more than one website so I can see more than one point of view.

The last way asking multiple people can help you is in your everyday job. My dad is a plumber. One time he came home from work and said that he was supposed to fix a fouset that day, but the pipe valves he bought were the wrong size. There was one size that almost every house in America has, but this house was different. They had bought $50 worth of pipes and didn't even use them. He then had to buy new ones and fix the fouset another day. He had checked with the mother but she said that she wasn't sure what size they needed. If he would have checked with the father of the family¬†they wouldn't have wasted the pipes. Another job that you would check with more than one person would be coaching. When a coach picks his or her team they probably check with the second coach and decide together who they will pick.

It can never hurt to ask more than one person for advice. Seeking multiple opinions can always help making a better choice. Whenever you are trying to decide something ask two of your friends and they can only help. Talking to more than one person before making a decision can help you when trying to solve a problem, research, or even at your job.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
B6D2D0599D30,"I think that this policy will make kids that want to play sports be forced to get better grades & keep a higher average which will be better for the school & the children that are in the school that play sports. A few supporting details are that this new policy will help the school have more activities because if a school has a good overall average then the government will be more willing to give them resources & it would make parents have more faith in school & the parents will know that they're sending their kids to a good school that will insure that they get good grades. It would also reflect to the community how good the school is & how they make sure that your kids will get better grades.

But this policy still isn't perfect because it says in the article that the majority of kids in the school have a C average and if they want people that are playing sports to have a B average there should be a way to help kids with a C average get better grades so they can play sports.

My conclusion is that this policy is a good way to make kids get better grades if they want to play sports but there should be a way that will help the kids with a C average to get a B average so they can play sports",0,persuade_corpus,,0

A0935CEA2649,"Although most extracurricular activities are fun and helpful, making them a necessity would be like making school longer. Some students don't participate in extracurricular activities because they don't want to or their parents don't want them to participate in them, but if it does become a necessity, then students would participate but some of them might not be interested at all and that would just lead to boredom and lack of participation.

First of all, students that don't participate in extracurricular activities do it for a reason. They might not have the time to participate in the activities between all their schoolwork and chores at home. They might have a lot of work from school because they take harder courses and their parents would expect them to do their chores. They might not be interested at what's being offered at their school because they have other unique interests and even if they were interested in the activities, they might not care about the activities because it's not going to be helpful for them and it is just going to consume and waste their time.

Another reason students don't participate in extracurricular activities is because their parents don't want them to. Most extracurricular activities take place after school and parents might not have the time pick up their kids from school because of their work hours. They might too busy to pick up kids or they live far from the school and it takes too much time to get to school. The parents might not want their child to take the activities because they want to spend more time together with their family and taking extracurricular activities might take away that family time. The parents also might not want their child so interested in the activity that he/she would stop caring about school and academics and do bad in school.

Finally, if kids do take an extracurricular activity that they are not interested in, they would feel like school got longer and would be angry about it because in a way, school did get longer. The activities could be so time consuming that they would have less time for other things like doing their homework or chores and, most importantly, relaxing. The activities could be so time consuming that they wouldn't have time to study for tests and quizzes and they wouldn't do as well as they used to in school because they don't have as much time to study as they used to.

In conclusion, the principal should keep the extracurricular activities optional and not make them a necessity because extracurricular activities and after school activities are supposed to be for students who have extra time and want to do something else in their free time. They are not for students that have a lot of trouble keeping up with their schoolwork. The students that don't take extracurricular activities don't participate for a good reason and some parents don't allow their kids to take extracurricular activities because they know what's best for their kids and they know it would be too time consuming for them.",0,persuade_corpus,,6

The planet Earth have a some of things simulatary between Venus, but this not can have life, becauses this planet hava a diferents conditions between the Earth, having all the atention for the people for study the planet, ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.""

The planet Earth have an atmosphere of almost 97 porcent of carbone dioxide a diference whit Venus have a sulfuric acid atmosphere and a 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and am atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what esoerience on our own planet.

The conditions in the planet Venus is a ""extrem than anything human encounter on Earth.""

The other solution whit the NASA use for the study of the planet and don't use human is tray to take a photography and a videography, but this not worker.

you will be able to have multiple choices to pick from and make the right decision.

you can even meet new people while your at it and also they can help you see it in another perspective.

Are you having a hard time deciding something? if you are you should talk to other people and see what they think its good to see what others think because, they can help you decide and give you great ideas,for example i had a friend and she would help me decide all the time and she would give out great ideas and i would pick the right decision with her help.

Also they can give you ideas and you can decide what is the best one and you can make the right decision and see what is the best idea and you can make the right decision not just that but you can see how others think and they might think different from how you think for example if you think that chocolate is better and your friend thinks strawberry is better then you should give a try and see if you made the right decision by picking strawberry instead of chocolate or she might be wrong and chocolate is better then strawberry but you will never know in till you try it.

Perhaps they can help you see things in another perspective,also you can make new friends while your at it,but not just that you can share your ideas as well and they can see what you think and help you out if your stuck and they will tell you if your doing something wrong and help you out and see it in another perspective,you might think that going to the movies is better and your friend might think that staying at home and watching a movie is better and she starts telling you why its better and you end up staying home and watching a movie because the reason she gave you where good.

You should give new things a try to because you will never know if its a good idea or not just ask your friends on what you should do during the weekend and they will help you and you will be able to try new things and take new ideas from that and its also nice to talk to someone and share ideas it will keep your mind off things and you wont be as stressed because you will have someone helping you.

those are the reason i think you should be seeking ideas not just from one person but from more and i think you should give it a try and see how it goes and hopefully it goes well because it works for me so give it a try hopefully i helped you see things in another perspective.¬†¬†   ¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,1

09AA28BBE192,"Dear Principal,

I have heard that you have made a new rule, that any students that do not have a B average can not participate in any school activities, including sports, music and more. I fully believe that you are on the right track, students need to be able to keep up with there school work and activities. I think that if the student is passing the class they should be able to participate, not be able to, because they do not have a B average.

Most Junior High or High School kids may get a C or a D as long as they are not failing in the class and is doing pretty well I believe they should still be able to participate. If the student may get a C or a D they should be talked to or informed by a teacher to be warned they need to improve on there school work in order to participate in the school activities. Many students that are involved in sports and after school activities juggle them, school work, chores at home, and somewhere in there sleep. It is a big responsibility for some students, and may mean a lot to them. So if a student may get a C or a D on a couple of papers which will bring there grade down to a C they should still be able to attend whatever they may be interested in. As I said in the beginning of my letter, the student should still be notified about his or her grade and that they may need to find some extra credit to bring the grade up, or a tutor, or even just working harder!

I am glad you are listening to the views of the students to see what we have to say. Grades are very important, I just think it would be more fair if students could still attend the events unless they were not passing. I hope I have helped in some way, I really hope you understand what I had to say every student should be able to attend or participate in whatever they may like with out a failing grade.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
021B2E55384C,"Students should be able to design their own summer projects. I believe that summer projects assigned should be student designed because it would be more freeing to the students if they got to design their own project for the summer instead of a project designed by a teacher. This is a good thing because it's their summer vacation and that should give them the right to decide what project they want to do so they don't feel like the school is control of them even during their summer vacation which often represents the idea of freedom until the next school year begins.

My reasoning on this is because it's the students vacation; it would be more fair to the student that they get to design what their project should be so they don't feel like the school is still in charge of them and what they do even while they're on break. I also don't think it would be fair to the teachers either if they were the ones who had to design a project for their students and eventually get bored of grading them because things could get repetitive depending on what the project would be. Some evidence I have for this reasoning is that I know some students that would be stressed out greatly from teachers designing what the students are going to work on over the summer during their vacation; it doesn't matter if the project is difficult or not because they would purely be stressed about the fact that they have a teacher designed project to do over the summer which feels more like schoolwork to do over the summer and that isn't a fun thing to be thinking about over your vacation.

I also feel that parents would have complaints to make if their child was being assigned to a summer vacation project that was designed by teachers because that would give them the idea that teachers aren't giving enough freedom to their child over the summer. Though if it was their child designing their project I feel like parents would be more supportive of that because not only is their child still learning during break; but with the student being the one to design the project; that means that it gets the students' creativity flowing which I believe parents would be more supportive of then if teachers were the ones to design the project.

While I do know that there would be students and parents who would prefer that teachers would design the projects so the students wouldn't have to think so much about it and just do the project like a lifeless mind slave; I would have to argue back that not only would that cause a block on the students creativity, which is very important, but it would also mean that teachers would have to design a project for all of their students, which is a lot mind you, while trying to make sure that the project would be fitting for each one of their students and I think that's a problem that comes back to the fact that it just wouldn't be fair for teachers to have to do that; especially because they would already be having to grade them; so with the teachers also designing the projects, like I said before, that has a risk of things getting repeated and that could cause the teacher annoyance, a headache, sleep deprivation, etc.

I think that if summer projects were to be assigned then students should be the ones designing them. It would boost their creativity as well as their learning because they would be designing the project and doing research for it, It would make the majority of parents happier if they knew that their child wasn't using their summer vacation for completing a project that was designed by a teacher and not their child, and the teachers would be less stressed as well knowing that the outcome of letting students design their summer project would result in more diversity between what the projects were about and would more than likely contain less repetition than they would if the teachers were to design the summer project. It makes more sense to me that the student would be the one designing what project they're going to do during their summer vacation.¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,7
CCB5EED97986,"Attitude is a crucial aspect of a person's life. It is the way a person thinks and feels about something or someone, and it can greatly impact their life. In this essay, I will research how attitude can help people's lives, reflect on moments in my life that demonstrate the impact of attitude, analyze my current attitude and consider how I could improve it, examine how my siblings or relatives have affected my attitude, look into how different people react to situations and how their attitudes impact the outcome, and describe how an individual's attitude could help them achieve their goals.

Firstly, research shows that having a positive attitude can greatly improve a person's life. A positive attitude can help a person cope with stress and adversity, improve their mental and physical health, and even increase their lifespan. For example, a study conducted by the Mayo Clinic found that people with a positive attitude were more likely to engage in healthy behaviors such as exercising and eating a healthy diet, which can lead to a longer and healthier life.

In my own life, I have experienced the impact of attitude firsthand. There have been times when I had a negative attitude towards a situation or person, and it only made things worse. On the other hand, there have been times when I had a positive attitude, and it made the situation or person more enjoyable and productive. For example, when I was struggling with a difficult project in school, I initially had a negative attitude towards it. However, after talking to a friend who had a positive attitude about the project, I began to see it in a different light. I started to enjoy the challenge and put in more effort, which ultimately led to a better outcome.

In addition to my own experiences, I have also seen how my siblings' attitudes have affected me. My younger sister, for example, always has a positive attitude, even in the face of adversity. Her optimism and resilience have inspired me to see things in a more positive light, even when things are tough. On the other hand, my older brother has a more negative attitude towards certain situations, which can sometimes bring me down and make me feel discouraged.

Furthermore, I have also noticed how different people react to situations and how their attitudes impact the outcome. For example, when I was part of a group project in school, I noticed that the person with the most negative attitude",1,llammistral7binstruct,,4

For example, when I was working on a group project in college, I had the benefit of working alongside three other students who each had their own area of expertise. Together, we were able to create a highly effective solution that drew from each of our strengths, whereas if I was working alone, the quality of the results would have likely suffered. 

Furthermore, collaborating with peers on a project or task helps us stay organized and on task. We are more motivated to stay focused and complete the assignment in a timely manner than if we were working independently since we don't want to let our group members down. Plus, we are able to keep up with the progress of our peers, which adds a layer of accountability to each member of the group.

Despite the advantages of group work, some may argue that it can lead to wasted time and disagreements between peers. Yet, with proper planning and communication, these issues can be minimized. Establishing group rules and mutually agreed-upon goals can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that decisions are being made efficiently. Additionally, setting due dates and holding each member of the team accountable to their individual tasks will help minimize conflicts and wasted time.

To sum up, working in a group comes with numerous benefits that can enhance the process and quality of completing an assignment. With proper planning and communication, disagreements and wasted time can be minimized, allowing groups to maximize their effectiveness. As demonstrated, group work can be much more beneficial than working alone and should be the preferred method for completing projects or tasks.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task:

F1620489BEB3,"Obesity is a growing problem in many countries, and it is not only affecting adults but also children. One of the main causes of obesity is the consumption of unhealthy food, especially during school hours. In this essay, I will explore the effects of obesity, healthy food options for school lunch, and how different cultures view food. Additionally, I will examine the consequences of unhealthy food choices and the financial implications of switching to healthier school lunch options. Finally, I will discuss the potential benefits of having healthier options for school lunches for both current and future generations.

Obesity is a serious health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of obesity has tripled since 1975, and it is now estimated that 39% of adults and 18% of children worldwide are overweight or obese. Obesity is associated with a range of health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer.

One of the main reasons for the rise in obesity is the consumption of unhealthy food, especially during school hours. School lunches often contain high levels of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems. In addition, many school lunches are highly processed and lack essential nutrients, such as fiber and vitamins.

Different cultures view food in different ways, and this can affect the types of food that are available in school lunches. For example, in some cultures, it is considered important to have a balanced diet that includes a variety of different foods, while in others, it is more important to focus on specific foods that are considered to be traditional or culturally significant.

The consequences of unhealthy food choices can be significant, both financially and health-wise. Unhealthy school lunches can lead to increased healthcare costs, as well as decreased productivity and increased absenteeism. In addition, switching to healthier school lunch options can have a positive financial impact, as it can reduce healthcare costs and increase productivity.

In conclusion, having healthier options for school lunches can have a range of benefits for both current and future generations. By reducing the consumption of unhealthy food and promoting a balanced diet, we can help",1,llammistral7binstruct,,4
8E73ED6F2FCC,"Did you know a recent study showed that 67 percent of high school¬†graduates wish they could have been more involved with their school? Well it's true. Most schools always provide extra activities and ways to help out your community through your school so why shouldn't we take advantage of that? Being forced to take those extra circulars will help students who didnt know those were an option, open their eyes to a new world of possibilities and fun. Staff should require students to take extra circular¬†activities with the school.

These activities will help students create great, new, long lasting friendships! Say you just moved to my school and you have very little to no friends, doing these extra activities will help introduce you to new people. When you sign up for something that you enjoy spending your time on, and you meet people there, why not be friends with them? You are building a relationship with people who enjoy the same things as you!

Even if you may not want to sign up for a extra activities, you may end up liking it. When your doing these clubs/activities/extra circulars, they could become your new hobby. Sammy Maple, soccer player for the Men's U.S. Soccer Team, said that he was first introduced to soccer at a young age because his elementary school asked everyone one sign up for a club, and he chose soccer club. From then on, Sammy kept playing and practicing and soon everyone around him saw the pure gift he had for the sport. You can benefit from these opportunities provided through your school in so many ways.

Being required to take extra circulars can help you build skills. Skills for the workplace, for a future job, or even people skills. In dog walking club we have to make fliers to promote our club so we get clients. I was in charge¬†of making them, hanging them up, and handing them out to people. When making them I learned not to be to wordy with the fliers so they are easy to ready. Next, I learned that when you hand them out, never give them out to people who are not aware of their surroundings. For example do not bombard someone who is on the phone¬†to give them one of your beautifully made fliers. I can use that information if I would ever want to pursue the job of being a sales person or a graphic designer.¬†These are things they can not teach you in any regular science or math class. These activities teach you valuable things.

I have come to see that most people will say that we should not be required to take extra circulars because they take too much energy away from us that could be used in school. Mostly student who are in the more active sports clubs have said this. I disagree with their claim because there are so many different types of clubs and activities you can choose from. If you find yourself having no energy to do homework because you are in the basketball club, maybe you could join the homework club and then play basketball at home¬†with¬†the energy you saved. If you stayed up late the night before and don't have the energy to participate in volleyball club, then you can join the craft club and sit around while painting. There should be no reason that you wouldnt want to join one of the many amazing clubs!

Getting involved with your school is a very important part of your education and can be very beneficial. University of South Carolina of computer math conducted a survey on how many of their 4 year graduates participated in more than 3 extra circulars throughout their high school¬†career. Over 93 percent said yes and the other 7 percent claimed they were part of a home school¬†group. As you can see, that 93 percent definitely got the benefits from those extra circulars.

A take away from reading my essay should be that the school system, and staff have your best interest in mind and want to help. They should do their part in helping us get the best¬†out of our education and require us do take extra circulars.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
3C693CBFEFB5,"Have you ever wanted to know if your attending a classes from home does it benefit you ? Many students want to be educated and successful¬†but, many problems come in there way causing public or private schools not to be the best decision for them. They decide they want to do school online and have said it has befitted them so much because, when they were doing public school they were failing there classes or the problems they were facing got harder for them to be in school. Many students have done online school and have been so successful and not only being successful but it has benefited¬†them in whatever situation They're in right now.

Although some may argue otherwise, but through family experiences, prodcasts¬†i've watched on the radio, and from hearing some celebrities talk.

One of my cousins named Generic_Name has been through so much and has not been able to continue going to public school. she's struggling a lot trying to keep her grades up and trying to get to school on time. she has an eating disorder. An eating disorder can be really hard at times when dealing with that and school . Her family has decided to let her do online school , and has helped her so much because while being at home eating and also going to doctor appointments she has the option to do her assignments online and also sometimes some teachers come to her house do homework assignments with her that help her a ton. Through online school she has overcame her struggle with her eating disorder and has also been so successful. As many years went by she has studied more an more. ""it's so crazy""

because while having so many problems she was facing she became a lawyer.

Some may argue that it's impossible how she became a lawyer after just doing online school, that its unfair how she got to where she is now because of home schooling, some people may say that by doing online school it can't benefit you nor can it make you a successful person it's just they way to failure. That's not true because when you hear so many stories and people talking about their experiences with home schooling you have to take to consideration that maybe it helps some and not others.

Many prodcasts on the radio have mentioned many real life situations on this subject . One i've heard that struck out to me was when this mom was talking about her son Generic_Name being really popular¬†on social media, She said that all throughout his high school years students his age and older have been bullying him and trying to get in fights with him for no reason. The mom signed her son up for online schooling. Generic_Name did online school as well as he did video conferences with his teachers every other day . Generic_Name has found it to be more easy he said that he is more concentrated because, it's just him and his laptop there's no distractions no more students bothering him trying to fight him. Since social media is such a big thing to keep up with when doing online school ,he can do both social media and be educated. However, some may argue that Generic_Name has to be a man and grow up, he can't always hide from people that are mean to him. That's true he can't always hide from people like that, but if he's fed up with it then maybe it was the best decision you can only handle so much hate.

Celebrities have talked in their interviews about them choosing home school over school and how beneficial¬†it was to them. There's this girl named Generic_Name .She said Being big on social media is really hard Dealing with the hate, dealing with people exposing you constantly for nothing, dealing with your name always being in people's mouth. Generic_Name has said that she's been bullied so many times and has found it harder for to deal with it. She has said that at one point she got depression and got harder and harder for her to continue going to public schools. Teachers recommended her to do online school. She took that advice and did home schooling for the rest of high school and also did online school for college as well. She said that she feels more successful. Generic_Name said that online school was the best thing she did and that she decided that for college she is going to a public college and she is also going to continue being big on social media. Some may argue that, They don't see how it benefited her. It have a major change on her, she knew what she wanted to do or be so how did it benefit her. It benefited her in so many ways, she no longer is afraid of what people think of her on social media. Sometimes people need space from public school and then when they feel that they are ready they can go to public schools again.

The importance¬†is for people that are going through the same problems for them to look and read from past experiences. For them to see if online school is beneficial¬†for them. In the future¬†people can look back at this and see what people were going through and how much they were struggling. This helps to see about how the past was like to compare to how it's like now. A solution is for people to do online school if they feel like being in public school is harder for them or for, whatever reason it may be. Also for people to notice and to realize that as being said multiple times that for people that are big on social media It's hard to cope with all the hate they get. A solution is for people not to give hate to others.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,3
7FB017FAC682,"Throughout history, there have been many individuals who have made significant accomplishments that have had a lasting impact on the world. These accomplishments have come in various forms, including scientific discoveries, artistic creations, and political movements. In this essay, I will analyze the impact of three notable figures and their accomplishments on the world, and how they can benefit the present and future.

Firstly, Albert Einstein is a well-known physicist who is famous for his theory of relativity. This theory revolutionized the way we understand the universe and led to numerous advancements in science and technology. Einstein's work has had a significant impact on the world, as it has led to the development of modern technology such as GPS, nuclear power, and even the internet. These advancements have greatly improved our quality of life and have allowed us to achieve things that were once thought impossible. In the future, Einstein's work will continue to inspire new generations of scientists and engineers to push the boundaries of what is possible.

Secondly, Mahatma Gandhi is a political leader who is known for his role in India's struggle for independence from British rule. Gandhi's non-violent approach to activism and his belief in the power of the people have inspired countless movements for social justice and equality around the world. His leadership and philosophy have had a lasting impact on the world, as they have shown that peaceful resistance can be an effective way to bring about change. In the future, Gandhi's legacy will continue to inspire leaders and activists to work towards a more just and equitable world.

Lastly, Leonardo da Vinci is an artist and inventor who is known for his incredible range of talents. Da Vinci's paintings, such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, are considered some of the greatest works of art in history. Additionally, his inventions, such as the flying machine and the armored car, have had a lasting impact on the world. Da Vinci's work has inspired countless artists and inventors to pursue their passions and to push the boundaries of what is possible. In the future, Da Vinci's legacy will continue to inspire creativity and innovation in all fields.

In conclusion, the accomplishments of individuals throughout history have had a lasting impact on the world. These accomplishments have come in various forms, including scientific discoveries, artistic cre",1,llammistral7binstruct,,2
FCA1F490DCB1,"Cars may actually disappear from the modern world humans live in. Cars sales are decreasing, and fewer cars actually are a benefit by making the air cleaner and making traffic and travel time faster.

Pollution is one issue that people have been trying to limit for years now. One way people can reduce emissions is to stop using their car. According to

Source 2:

Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer , pollution in Paris drastically decreased after driving bans were implemented. The ban on driving cleared up enough smog, that the French government was able to rescind the ban. Across the globe, transportation is America's second largest source of emissions and pollution as explained in

Source 4:

The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal . Rosenthal explains how that the decreasing number of cars on the roads in America will help the environment and decrease carbon emissions. Car emissions may be the largest form of pollution in America, but the percentage in American cities where most people are found has a drastically higher amount of emissions. Both Duffer and Rosenthal show that automobile decreases lead to pollution deacreases as well. Cars limitaions will lead to greener grasses and bluer skies.

Traffic is a problem that most people experience during their daily travels, whether its going to school or work. Limiting cars will lower traffic in cities everywhere. Shown in

Source 1:

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal , the city of Vauban, Germany has stores placed a walk away instead of far away in malls. Vauban has its stores located closer, which will be easier to access to citizens, instead of waiting on a highway with a traffic jam. Also in Bogota, Columbia, car and rush hour restrictions have drastically lowered traffic time, as well as opened bike lanes for a new means of transportation, according to

Source 3:

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky . New bike lanes and sidewalks open up a new way to travel, distributing people between two ways of transportation instead of cramming everyone onto one highway. 118 miles of bike lanes have been built in Bogota and hopefully in new places too, to lower traffic and transportation time. Car limitaions will lead to a quicker way to get to the place you want to be at, instead of waiting in a line full of automobiles.

Cars are disappearing anyways, due to culture and people being happier.

Source 1:

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal shows how people in the city feel about the restrictions on cars. Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walter is joyful now that car limitations were implemented. Rosenthal explains the stress-free life in Vauban, with its children playing and riding bikes in the outdoors. This happy life may actually be shaping citizens of America due to its decrease in car purchases, and license decreases.

Source 4:

The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal explains that the peak of driving was at 2005, and now people are going through a long-term cultural shift. Driving decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 in younger people. People are not buying cars, because they do not need them. Car limitations may not even be needed due to happier people and the downfall of driving.

Cars are dissapearing due to limitations, and that is a great thing. Less cars means less pollution and traffic, along with happier people and a car-free culture. A better environment and a faster way to travel, will result in joyous people.       ¬†        ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
96E0F82A7BCF,"To the principal:

A recent problem that we have been facing is the school cell phone policy. I know that you are considering two possible policies and I would like to tell you my opinion on which policy is better for the student and the education matter.

Cell phones are a way for students to relax and spend their free time, but cell phones can be a major distraction, especially when it comes to education. I say that we should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

If we do not let the students bring the phones to school at all, they will feel restricted and will alternatively bring their cell phones to school. This will cause more of an absence of mind.

Letting the students use the phones only at free times will teach them trust and respect. Students will no be distracted in class and will have a good time. This way, they concentrate on school work as well as their other interests.

This is my opinion and proposal on the school's cell phone policy. I hope you will consider my idea and thank you for your time.

489d3798,"We should keep with changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Because it is logical and is very fair, these are my reasons why.

For one, it seems a lot more leveled out. The Electoral College is not as fair, because the electors help the president, the the president helps the electors. They could have past experience or an old relationship of some sort. bradford Plumer quotes, ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" He clearly says Electoral College needs to be abolished, over & done with.Because they don't have logical information on everything they do. And they only have practical reasoning, not liberal or conservative reasoning.

Next reason, their method is not bulletproof as they claim it to be. No method is perfect, but the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope in succeeding. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..."" He is saying the way the method is set up, makes it seem worthless to even vote for the person you choose or chose.

Finally, my last reason to why we should keep with changing to election by popular vote is confusion.The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Some candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning because of the winnertakeall system. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" That is pretty selffish and ridiculously unfair.

However, having the election by popular vote has it's flaws as well. Such as the certainty of outcome. Electoral College having a dispute over the outcome of an election is possible, but it's less likely than the popular vote. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state."" He is simply stating that if there is a difficulty in the popular vote election, they have an electoral vote to choose the winner.

Those are my very important, detailed reasons why we should change to election by popular vote. Recap, fairness is important & is needed in any method, the Electoral College method is not as solid as they believe it to be, & all of the confusion the Electoral College puts off to some states.",0,train_essays,,2
D28B89FAFE9E,"In the United States children must attend school by law. Traditionally school has been a place that students must physically go to. In recent years, new technology, like the internet and video conferencing, has changed education and school systems. Today some schools allow students to attend classes¬†online instead of physically being in the classroom. Students would not benefit from attending classes from home because they would not learn vital social skills, bulling would increase, and they would not get to experience school.

Students would lack critical social skills by attending class from home. School is a place where students learn but also socialize with their peers. Through this socialization students are taught what is socially acceptable¬†to do in public, how to read people, and how to carry a face to face conversation. Students that only communicate online or over video miss out on learning these skills. When talking through text messages, the meaning of the message can be misinterpreted. In face to face conversations it is easy to understand the meaning of a message by looking at the person's facial expressions and body language. For example, if someone said, ""I'm dying"" over a text message it would be interpreted that they were actually dying. However, this person most likely meant it as an expression and if they had said it in person it would have been interpreted as a joke by looking at their upbeat facial expression. By attending school online and not physically interacting with people, students miss out on learning social skills that are needed in everyday life as well as the workplace. Due to students lacking social skills they are more likely to hurt someones feelings which could turn into bullying.

By attending classes from home, students would face an increase in bullying because it is easy to hide behind a screen. In recent years there has been an increase in bullying though social media. This is because people don't have to face the consequences of their actions or words because they are protected by a screen and user name. Students brains' are not fully developed yet and they often don't understand how hurtful words can be. By not physically seeing the impact their remarks make on someone, students are more likely to say hurtful things that they would not say to someone in person. An example of this that occurs everyday is when people comment mean things on a picture someone else posts. The people that post these mean comments would never say these things out loud or to that person face to face. This is because they would have to have confidence and face potentially retaliation. By saying it online a person can hide behind a persona and user name¬†and never know how that person was impacted by their words. Communicating and interacting through a screen can not only hurt others but cause students to miss out on important experiences.

Students would miss out on experiencing school by attending classes from home. Many people say that high school is the best time of your life. Students would not get to experience attending pep rallies, hanging out with friends between classes, and being apart of a community. School is a place for students to discover who they are and try new things. By attending classes online students would not get to experience these things. Viewing things through a screen is not a way to live life. If students don't experience classic school things, they miss out on a whole aspect of life. Watching a video of something happening is not as moving or memorable as experiencing it yourself. You wouldn't feel the nervous energy of a class before a test or the sense of belonging you get when the whole school sings the school's fight song at a pep rally. By attending classes online students would miss out on many experiences that they don't get later on in life.

Some people may say that students would benefit from attending classes from home because it would be more accessible. However, this is not necessarily true because not everyone has access to internet at their house. Students that do not have a computer or internet access will suffer and be at a disadvantage because they would not be able to access their education. Attending classes from home would not benefit students because they would not know social skills, would face more bullying, and miss the experience of going to school.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,1

Oh no that's your alarm clock. You have 20 minutes to rush and get ready for school before you miss the bus, again. You can't afford to miss the bus because your mom already left. As you hurry out the door you remember you didn't eat breakfast. ""Oh well"" you think, you rarely eat breakfast anyways. Once you get to school, loud noises and stress about your English project fill your head. As you go throughout the day, all you think about is that glorious bell that rings at 2:10 on the dot to save you. Then you'll finally be able to go home, just to do this all over again the next day. Public school has created an environment filled with bullying, stress, and does not benefit students who face learning or mental disabilities, but online school could be a solution to these issues.

Every student who has been in a public school has had the thought, ""What if they don't like me?"". Bullying and discrimination have become so normalized in the school system all across the country, to the point where students feel there is no one to go to. Everyone must fit into a certain standard, or else they are considered ""weird"" or get left out. If you don't have the latest shoes or wear your hair a certain way, then chances are, it's going to be hard to immediately fit in. We were taught as kids that it's OK to be different, but is it really? If you dont find a clique to fit in with, no one will take you in. School has become less and less about learning, and more about the ability to make people like you. You can see it as soon as you walk into a public school. Girls wearing clothes they hate, but do it because if they don't, they won't have friends, and boys playing sports that they don't even like, all so they'll fit into a group. The need to feel liked by your peers has taken a large toll on student's mental health. Many students dread going to school due to the hate as soon as they walk into the building. With online school, students will never have to fear hate from their peers again, and be able to be at peace with what they choice to wear and do.

Did you the math homework? Oh and the history project? What about the 5 page English essay? The science lab, did you finish it? An average high school¬†student¬†takes 7 classes, with only about an hour a day for that class. So to fit in the information not covered in class, teachers will assign homework every night. Every teacher will tell you homework shouldn't take more than an hour. Now multiply that hour by your other seven classes. Students already wake up at early hours every weekday just to go to sleep at late hours due to homework. With online classes, these unfair hours won't affect students. The option of waking up later and being able to spread out your classes will help student's stress levels tremendously. There will be no more rushing to do your homework on the bus or not wanting to go to school because you and your teacher don't get along. With less stress on students backs, grades could possibly be affected positively and students will feel happier about the idea of school.

Public school was built on an idea that every student is perfect, but that is in fact not the case. Not every student has the mental or physical capability of sitting in a brightly lit classroom for an hour at a time, listening to a teacher drone on and on about a subject that does not interest them. Not every special needs student is properly diagnosed, so they're seen to be

""dumb"" by their teachers and peers. Students with things such as ADHD are not benefited with how the school system is currently setup. Their brain structure just does not allow them to sit and focus for an hour at a time, seven times a day. Many students are athletes, and with athletics come concussions. Many concussed students are told by medical professionals to not go to school, yet they still have to, because if they don't, they fail. There are so many setbacks for many students in the current public school system, that online school should be an easier option for them. Students with learning disabilities will have a better opportunity to pass, without fearing judgment from others. Students with focusing problems can now space out their classes and be able to move around as they learn. Students with medical issues can learn from the comfort of their own home and do as the doctor informed them to. Online school can create countless opportunities for students who need them most.

Bullying and stress in public schools can finally be ended, along with giving students with learning disabilities new advantages. Online school can now reach out to students who were feeling as if there was no hope left. It can hopefully improve grades, and increase graduation rates. There will be many more students wanting to go to college and create new jobs and career options. Online school can make a great impact on our future.   ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,5
A20D6E252177,"Dear state senator,

You seriously need to change this whole ""Electoral College"" voting system. It's not right and not accurate. Wouldn't it be fair if the people had a say in this? We..The People?

Popular vote definetly makes more sense in this case. It's proven that an electoral vote would sometimes end in a tie, resulting in a ""You're President, You're Vice President"" scenario. No one wants to go through a tie cause the election would go to the House of Representatives and then they would decide who is who. That's pretty stupid...if I do say so myself.

Now if the people, us, had a say in this...Then we'd defiently have a winner. No ties, No mistakes, No nothing. Just a plain, clean winner. The electoral college is unfair to voters to be honest. The electoral college is irrational, unfair, outdated and annoying. No one uses it anymore. Due to it being completely unfair to citizens and states alike.

The Electoral College rule says ""It requires a presidential canidate to trans-regianl appeal."" Don't you think we know that? Then there's the fact that only ""Big States"" have a say, what about the smaller ones? There are people there too you know.

The Electoral College does avoid the problem of ""Run-Off Elections"" but that doesn't help the fact that we should all have a say.

D26D8E38326A,"What do you do for fun? Sports,student council, or FFA are all examples of fun extracurricular activities to do at school. You should always try to do an extra activity. Therefore I agree that students should engage in extracurricular activities because it teaches then responsibility, time management, and it is fun and benifitail to do.

First off doing something other than just school can teach kids responsibility and time management.

Doing a sport for example. To do this you would be completing school work and the sports work,so you would have to be able to complete school work on time then focus on the sport you're playing. The way to do all of that is to manage your time with school and activities to do all of your school work and keep your grades up. Doing a extra activity requires responsabilliy and dedicating time.

Secondly extracurricular can be fun and healthy for kids. You never know what doors will open for you by taking a chance. By playing a sport could take you in to a profetinal¬†league. By joining school council could take you in to politics. You just never know what opportunities will come your way by doing something new. finding opportunities can be fun and uplifting. over all doing a extracurricular make you a more well rounded person.

In conclusion kids should do extracurricular activities because It teaches responsibility, time management and it is healthy and beneficial to young adults. Get out there and try something new.",0,persuade_corpus,,9
falcon_180b_v1_49,"Hey there, I am a 7th-grade student and I totally disagree with the decision made by the principal. I think it is a terrible idea to force students to participate in extracurricular activities like sports, yearbook, or student council. 

First of all, some students may not be interested in any of these activities or they may have other priorities like focusing on their academics. Forcing them to join an extracurricular activity will only distract them from their studies and may lead to a decrease in their grades. 

Furthermore, some students may have personal or family commitments that prevent them from regularly attending after-school programs. These students may face undue pressure and stress trying to balance their commitments at home and school, which could negatively affect their well-being.

Lastly, extracurricular activities can be expensive, and not all students' families can afford the cost of uniforms, equipment, or other expenses associated with these activities. It's not fair to force these students to participate when they may not be able to afford it.

In conclusion, I think the principal should reconsider the decision and allow students to choose whether they want to participate in extracurricular activities or not. Forcing students to participate in activities they may not be interested in or can't afford is not the right approach. Students should be given the freedom to choose how they want to spend their time after school hours.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

9FCF605CC740,"dear state senator, i believe that we should abolish the electoal college and just leave up to populare vote. The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair, and it poses a threat to the U.S constitution.

The electoral college is unfair because it takes away the demicratic way of society that our founding fathers set up. In the United States of America we leave it up to the people to vote but if the people of the united states vote someone in an he doesnt get to run the country because the electoral college decided diffrently then we should not be called a democracy. For example in the 2000 election with Al Gore and Gorge W. Bush, the people of the united states voted for Al Gore, but due to the electoral college Bush won the election. in the passage The Indefensible Electoral College it says ""Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" what does that tell you? more then half of the USA would prefer a people vote instead of both!

Furthurmore, I believe we should due away with the electoral college because it poses a threat to the U.S constitution. when i say this i mean it is a threat to the citizens of the USA. the people of the united states were thought to vote our president in? but if the majority of voters vote for someone an the other oponent wins then where is the domocracy in that? also in the artical The Indefensible Electoral College¬† says ""oh what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? it happened in hawaii in 1960. Luckily, vice president Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, vatlidated only his opponent's electors."" imagin if that happens again an someone doesnt notice that? then there will be double slaters an there bound to vote for the same canidate so that will be an easy state to win for that canidate. The electoral college is nothing but problems.

In conclution, The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair, and it poses a threat to the U.S constitution. You make your conclution based on this Mr. senator       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
llama_70b_v1412,"Hi, I'm a 6th grader and I think zoos are really cool! But I've heard some people say that zoos are bad for animals and the environment. So, I wanted to figure out if zoos are good or bad.

First, let's talk about the good stuff. Zoos can help animals who are sick or hurt. They have special vets who can take care of them and make them better. Sometimes, zoos even help animals who are in danger in the wild. For example, if there's a big storm coming, zoos can take in animals and keep them safe until the storm passes.

Zoos also help us learn about animals. They have signs and brochures that tell us about the animals and their habitats. We can learn about what they eat, how they live, and what we can do to help them. It's really cool to see the animals up close and learn about them in person!

But, there are also some bad things about zoos. Some people say that zoos are like prisons for animals. They're locked up in small spaces and can't roam free like they would in the wild. It's like if we were stuck in our bedrooms all day and couldn't go outside and play!

Another bad thing is that some zoos don't take care of their animals very well. They might not give them enough food or water, or they might keep them in dirty cages. That's not fair to the animals!

So, I think zoos can be good or bad, depending on how they're run. If they're run well and take good care of the animals, they can help us learn about animals and help animals who are in trouble. But, if they're not run well, they can be bad for the animals and we shouldn't support them.

I hope this helps! What do you think about zoos? Do you think they're good or bad?",1,llama_70b_v1,"The role of zoos in conservation and education has been a topic of debate. Argue for or against the continued operation of zoos, providing reasons and examples to justify your position.",0
C652190DB53F,"Working alone is more beneficial than working with a group. People can work relax and calm without being interrupted, and no one has to ask other people opinion, and also people are shy , they might don't like being surrounded by other people. On the other hand, working with a group can be good, because everyone can share ideas. However working alone is much better.

Work is already stressful, and work with people talking and giving opinion about the job is worse. Imagine a work where the whole group is speaking and there is someone stressed, this person won't be able to work relax and think about new ideas, probably when the person get home, it will be more stressed than someone who worked alone and quiet. Being alone make any person relax, and once you're relax no one can stop it, the ideas come to your mind.

During doing the work, might suddenly appear a new brilliant idea, and with a group the proposal is check with them and see if everyone agrees, and it spend time, and also might happen that not everyone agreed. Working alone can gain time, because people can use the time they're asking the group to work more instead of asking someone opinion. Also it creates discussion, more and more people speaking at the same time, disagreements and agreements, wasting time, and making people confused. Then it is better work alone to gain time working instead of asking, everyone does your own work.

Being surrounded by a lot of people might be hard for shy people. For example, I'm shy, and work in group for me is a struggle, have to talk to other person, have to share my ideas, I can't do my work relax, I can't either think about anything. The impression caused is that people will look at your work and judge it, and won't agree, and there I'm, needing to do everything again, in most of the times I don't even show my own work I just agree with other people work. It is not good, the brain doesn't work how it was supposed to work, people looking and may judging, all of it might collaborate for a terrible work.

Some people might say that work together people could share ideas and open the door to new opportunities, of course share ideas is a good point, see every point of view. However working alone has much more benefits, is better to have a good time working, without stress than share ideas and get home stressed and full of everything.

8D26E9ABC857,"Use cellphone and driving

In 2018 there were 1.6 million crashes annually from cellphones and driving. Cellphones are the lead factor that's caused accidents. Many accidents come from teens using their phones while driving. For an example they can create dangerous, and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident .For this reason cellphones should not be used while driving.

One reason why using phones and driving because when bad accidents takes instance people or teens lives.

they are also ruining people life like making people can't walk again, forget how to do things like walk, and, eat. Lots of people diening because of these cellphones calls or messages.

your cellphone can wait until you get to the place to see what the notification is. Caused too many car crashes to happen.

when teens phone are in the car and they get a notification. Teens are so anxious to see calls or sent a text.

Therefore, they should ban the cellphones completely while driving for the safety of everyone. When teens try to do two things at once. Multitask caused its them to have an accident quicker than a regular accident. Whatever the emergency, always wait until they stop or get to their destination.

My answer for teens is tempted to text and drive therefore they should not use cellphones while driving. Or have a phone in their surroundings. Banning cellphones while driving is for the safety of everyone. If so we wouldn't lose as many teenagers lives to tweets, texts and phone calls.                  ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
764FD24626F8,"Imagine a world with cars that can drive by themselves; how easy everything would be! Now imagine everything else that must come with this new technology; society would need new laws, economy would need more money, and what would happen to the people? How would the people change? How much would this new technology affect our already-dependent-on-technology society?

The public distribution of driverless cars would cause a large-scale reformation of many aspects of society. This would include not only the cars themselves, but also laws, roads, and the minds of the people. As explained in paragraph 9, laws would have to change to accomodate these driverless cars, and to ""cover liability in case of an accident."" The process of making new laws will forcefully change how people think about certain situations, such as insurance. The making of new roads might come about, also, because the option of smarter roads is open; the roads worked ""surprisingly well."" This will also change our society and the mind processing of individuals, as they will become less independent.

Another characteristic of people wit driverless cars that will change is their ability to stay alert and focused. In paragraph 8, the passage explains that one way to battle boredom for the passengers aboard the car is to provide entertainment and information systems that will automatically turn off if the need for custom navigation arises. However, although this is an innovative idea, suddenly turning off the systems will leave passengers confused and perhaps angry, and neither of these reactions will keep the possible driver alert and focused enough to get the car out of danger quickly. The systems will be distracting and will linger in the minds of the passengers, which can be unsafe when the driver must take control immediately after being interrupted from his favorite television show. If the car then crashes, we must ask why it would have happened, if the systems were supposedly so safe and foolproof.

Other questions we would have to ask ourselves concern the costs of introducing driverless cars into society. In paragraph one, Sergey Brin says that these cars would ""use half the fuel of today's taxis."" However, this decrease in expenses cannot combat the larger amount of sums due to several aspects. For example, building enough cars to release to the public would be quite costly; in paragraph 6, Sebastian Thrun says that some technology to build the driverless cars used to cost two hundred million dollars, and ""it wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack."" The process of building these cars and getting them on the road could be very long and very expensive, throwing the United States into even greater debt. Another problem would be insurance. Paragraph 9 says, ""Even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident...who is at fault -- the driver of the manufacturer?"" This event could lead to a court case, and buying more insurance to cover more needs: none of which comes at an easy price.

""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" This excerpt from paragraph 10 shows that automakers are merely assuming that they can surpass any obstacle and fix everything. However, we must consider what might happen if these problems can not be solved. The costs spent on creating these cars would have been for almost nothing, and society will have to reluctantly ease back into the ""old ways,"" disappointed, thinking about what they could have had. It will be better in the long run to prevent the completion of driverless cars at this moment in time, when society and economy are not quite ready for it yet. It is an easy future we must be prepared for, but also look forward to.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
BE604A32144C,"I think that yes if there was driverless cars that not just a couple people should have them everyone should. If there was someone that did not have one of these cars they would be at a higher risk of someone wrecking. The laws on speed limits would definetly change. There would be a bunch more laws besides thatone that would change as well. People would act different one the road knowing who is responsible.

I mean if your driving one of these smart cars and someone else dosn't have one and they wrecked into you it would not be good. There would be a big debate about this and who would be to blam. The companies would have too much money so you could not sue them. Your attention would imidietly turn on the driver of the other car the company would have your back then. Those people should not have to deal with it if that is the case the company should.

It would be nice for everyone to have one of these because drunk driving issues would go down. wrecks would be less common if the mechanics work on the cars they provide. Companies think to much of money so that would be the only problem. I mean sure they wold not make as much money as they would like to but people would be a lot more safe then they are. The money they make should go to the coverage of peoples cars.

Another problem I would have with this is would you be able to get to your job on time? If you have a certain speed limit and or if yor car stops working what are y going to do. I think that if you get this car everything should have to be covered by the compaies you buy it from. Some states are already trying to ok all of this through way higher powers than they should. They should have a system on the car that explains why your late.

One of my last concerns is if the future generations would still know how to drive. I mean if they don't know how the car works than what is the point of it. I think that anyone who gets one of these cars should have to take driving courses one a year for a week. They can take them any day they choose as long as it adds up to a week out of the year.

E341A9A188EB,"Because it's a common activity for most people, sending a text doesn't seem dangerous. However, when you're doing it behind the wheel, there are a ton of other factors at play. Driving is a privilege because of the inherent risk and responsibility we all need to assume out on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers.

It can be hard to grasp the dangers of texting and driving, but once you know the facts, this hazardous habit starts to become a reality. When you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. In just the 5 seconds it takes to send or read a short text message, you've already zoomed past the length of a football field with minimal attention on the road ahead. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children.

No driver wants to think about being responsible for a traffic accident that takes his or her own life or the lives of other motorists or pedestrians. Nevertheless, most drivers still use their cell phones while operating their vehicle. While taking a phone call is dangerous enough, the advent of text messaging made cell phones even more incompatible with driving a car. Reading or sending a text or email takes both eyes off of the road, your mind off the task of driving, and sometimes both hands off the wheel.

When you're behind the wheel, you should always be considerate of other drivers and remember you're putting your life at risk while texting and driving.

Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, on that many young drivers take lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers' lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the knowledge that your decision to pick up your phone while operating a vehicle caused someone to suffer a life-altering injury or be killed?

While driving, you should always be focused on getting from point A to point B. Having any kind of mobile device in your hand while driving puts your life at a major risk. Once driver takes his or her eyes off the road to read a text message, suddenly the driver's life is changed by a horrific accident.

Some people do not go to school, but they take online classes. some students work at night and they do not have time to take online classes.

falcon_180b_v1_898,"I am in grade 11, and I strongly believe that students should be allowed to grade their teachers. It is essential because the students are the ones who experience the teacher's teaching style and methods firsthand. Therefore, their feedback is crucial for both the teacher's improvement and the student's academic success.

Firstly, by grading their teachers, students can express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the teacher's performance. If a particular teacher is not meeting their expectations or failing to explain the subject matter adequately, it gives a chance for the teacher to rectify their mistakes. For instance, a student may feel that the teacher's lectures are boring, uninteresting and fail to engage the class. By providing this feedback, the teacher can modify their style, and the student can enjoy the subject more.

Furthermore, when students evaluate their teachers, it creates a sense of accountability. It ensures that the teachers put in their best efforts and deliver quality education to their students. It also helps in identifying any weak areas of the teacher's teaching style or knowledge of the subject matter. For example, the evaluations could expose a teacher who doesn't have enough experience teaching the course, resulting in a lack of knowledge of the subject.

However, some people believe that students shouldn't grade their teachers because it may lead to biased evaluations. They argue that students may give a teacher a poor evaluation for personal reasons rather than their actual performance. While this is a valid concern, measures can be taken to ensure that students provide unbiased feedback. For example, the school could have the evaluations conducted anonymously, ensuring that the students cannot be personally targeted by the teacher.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers. It provides a chance for both the student and the teacher to improve, and it promotes a healthy and engaging learning environment. The benefits far outweigh the drawbacks, and it is time for schools to incorporate student evaluations of teachers.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Some people believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers.

I heard that you came up with two new cell phone policies and you cant decide which one to use. You probably think since I am a student that I would go for policy number 1 but you are sadly mistaken. I am in favor of policy number two because I know us teenagers. We might agree with turning it off during class time but I assure you we wont. I think we will be on the phone all the time looking on facebook or texting a friend we would hardly pay attention. that would probably be the worst policy in the history of policies.

If you don't believe me you can do an experiment. One class can have policy number 1 and one class can have policy number two. You can teach them the same exact thing and give them the same test on Friday and see who gets the highest percentage passes. To make sure its accurate you can do the test multiple times I'm sure you will get the same results. one reason I think this policy would be a bad idea is that we aren't mature enough to handle having phones on in school . We would probably cheat on tests or something, but that's just my opinion on the matter.

Many people have found their passion and have continued on and have become very successful because of a club or activity they were in as a student. I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the opportunity to make new friends, discover new interests and cure their after school boredom.

Firstly, getting students involved in an extracurricular¬†activity will help them to make new friends and meet new people. This can help students make friends with a similar interests. For example, one of the most beloved country music duos of all time, Brooks and Dunn, met through extracurricular activities. In 6th grade, the two joined a club called FFA and fell in love with it. Their FFA chapter had a bus for the members when they went on trips. The old, rusty bus had no radio. A couple close friends of the boys had saw them sing in church before and suggested they sing on the trips because of the broken radio in the bus. The boys agreed and sang all sorts of country songs for the members as they traveled. The boys had such a passion for singing what was on the radio that they figured they would produce songs for the radio. Now, they are both millionaires and travel to sing all across the world.

In addition to making new friends, extracurricular activities sprout interest in other hobbies. In 1988, a mother signed her child up for music club because she was working late and didn' t want her daughter at home by herself. Little did she know, her daughter would be one of the most famous singers in history. Her daughter was the worldwide phenomenon, Taylor Swift. Taylor was a shy kid. Though she had a passion for music, she was to scared to sing in front of people. While being in music club, Taylor gained enough confidence to sing in church. While singing in church, a record label producer was there and signed her to his label. She is now producing music and make millions of dollars.

Lastly, extracurricular activities give students something to do when they get home, after school. Some students come home and immediately turn on the TV or play video games, instead of exercising or doing their homework. If it wasn't for a policy at J.K Rowling' s school would would not have the many great books we have today. Her freshman year of high school she entered book club. She gained a love and passion for science fiction books and decided to start writing them. Many of her books have been turned into movies and she is now one of the most successful authors of all time.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities are very beneficial to our students in many ways. They can help our students be successful in our future careers.

I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the wonderful opportunities like making new friends, discovering new interests and giving kids something to do after school. These can help students in many ways and help us develop a successful future generation.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,1

B53ED19CD783,"Presidential elections have always been decided by electoral votes. The elections today should be voted on using popular votes. All though electoral votes keeps the amount of work tallying up votes down; popular votes will give you a more accurate percentage of votes each candidate recieves.

Initially, when you use popular votes to decide a victor, there will be a more accurate percentage or number of votes per candidate. Popular votes are counted by each individual voter. This allows a more accurate voting scale to be used, since there is an exact number of voters. Electoral votes are based on a state's population and each region in the state is assigned a democratic elector. This only accounts for the majority of the population's votes, which means some voters' votes are irrevelant if the majority voted for an opposing candidate.

Additionally, counting popular votes, while time consuming, is worth the effort. Popular votes, when used, are to make sure that everybody is accounted for in the poll. More people would probably vote if they knew that their vote actually matters. When popular votes are used it may take a longer time to tally all of those up than it would for electoral votes, it shows exactly how many people are actually voting. This will let the government know how many votes they should expect to see on each poll.

In summation, popular votes, though time consuming, are a better way of electing a new president; instead of electoral votes. Electoral votes are an easier and faster means of counting votes but, popular votes show and acount for everybody that contributes to the poll and/or election.

50105417A5B7,"Dear,state senator

The Electoral College voting method is a very debated subject among the people. That is why I am here to explain to you my opinion on it, and why i think that the whole process needs to be stopped. As you can probably already tell, I completely dis like the whole process all together but anyway here is my letter to you.

The first issue with this process is that there is not that much stability to it. When people vote for who they want as president they're giving their votes to some one else just so the person they gave them to can vote for who they want to,not for the elector that that person actually put down on the ballet. We the people are not even the ones who technically get to pick who we want as president, it's the electors.

This being said brings me to my next point,what is the point of the people voting if we arent even the ones who get to pick the representatives? Yes, they say that when people are voting,they are actually voting for electors but what if the electors dont listen to the peoples votes and only vote for who they want? It is true that the slate of electors is trusted to vote for the parties person they want to elect but, there is always that tiny percentage that the electors can break that trust.

CE58704B8EB3,"Most schools require students to complete a summer project to make sure that students are still expanding their knowledge while school is closed. These summer projects are long, uninteresting, and tiring. Most students refuse to complete a summer project. Summer projects should be made into something that students would want to do and enjoy doing. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be creative, students can pick an assignment that is best for their knowledge capability, and students become more intrigued with their assignment.

Typically when summer projects are assigned from a teacher, they're similar assignments. When summer projects are similar, they attend to make all students the same and strips away any originality. Students need to be able to show their individuality through their work. Research shows that when students choose their assignments, they exceed¬†by forty-five percent more than a teacher-assigned assignment. Creativeness is something that should be essential to students because that it was forms them as a whole and makes them unique to themselves. Each summer project would allow students to express themselves in ways that a teacher-assigned summer project can't. Creativity is something that is with-in a person and something that should never be taken away from an individual.

Students come in variety, from ethnicity, gender, age, and most importantly in this case, teaching perforations. Students will learn a lot better if they were allowed to pick their own assignments because they could create a summer project that is perfect for their learning pace. For example, I observed that when I am completing an assignment that is not too fast or not too slow for me, I do better tremendously. Summer projects are so horrific already, at the very least students should be able to decide what is best for their learning capacity. Pacing would set students up for great improvement and succession.

Students will become more interested in their summer project. Most students will not complete or do well on something that they are not interested in. An article stated that, because students are so young, and their brain has not developed yet, their attention span is very short. Meaning that students will not focus on anything for a very long time, especially something that is boring and has no significance to them. Evidence also shows that each year the passing rate and or completion rate of summer projects never exceed or increase, the rates always decrease. Students will be intrigued with their work if its assigned by them. If teachers keep assigning summer projects then the passing rate of the summer projects will continue to decrease, students need to stay interested and the most important way to have that happen is to allow them to choose their own summer project assignment.

Summer projects need to cater to students to cause improvement. Students do not require much to be successful,teachers just have to have the ability to allow their students to be flexible with their work. It is important that teachers grasp knowledge of how important it is that a student remains creative,that a student can pace themselves,that students remain intrigued, and most importantly students become successful with their summer projects. Summer projects are a wonderful idea but being student-assigned is way better.",0,persuade_corpus,,2
E4FF635779B8,"Group Work vs. Individual Work: Which is More Beneficial?

As an 8th grader, I have experienced both group work and individual work in various subjects, and I must say that both have their pros and cons. At first, I thought group work was the way to go, but after reflecting on my experiences, I have come to realize that individual work has its advantages too.

One of the biggest pros of group work is the ability to collaborate and share ideas. When working in a group, we can bounce ideas off each other and come up with something much better than what we could have produced alone. For example, in our science class, we recently worked on a project where we had to design and build a bridge using different materials. By working in a group, we were able to come up with a more creative and sturdy design than if we were working alone.

Another advantage of group work is the opportunity to learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. When we work together, we can recognize what each person is good at and delegate tasks accordingly. For instance, in our math class, we worked on a project where we had to solve a complex problem. By working in a group, we were able to divide the task into smaller parts and use each person's strengths to solve it.

However, there are also some cons to group work. One of the biggest cons is the potential for conflict. When we work in a group, there is always the possibility of disagreements and misunderstandings. For example, in our language arts class, we worked on a project where we had to write a story together. However, some group members had different ideas about how the story should be written, which led to conflicts and delays.

On the other hand, there are also some pros to individual work. One of the biggest advantages is the ability to work at one's own pace. When we work alone, we can take the time we need to understand the material and complete the task without feeling rushed. For instance, in our history class, we worked on a project where we had to create a timeline of important events. By working alone, I was able to take my time and make sure I included all the necessary details.

Another advantage of individual work is the ability to take ownership of the work. When we",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Research the pros and cons of working in groups versus working alone, and analyze how experiences can change an individual's perspective on which is more beneficial.",6

I believe that you should have students should have to reach a certain grade if they want to play on sports teams. But i do not think that there averages should be as high as a B average. mainly because most of the students in our school don't have grades as high as a B average. it would be better for the students if want to be on the sports teams, that there average should be at leased a C average. i believe this because its good for kids to play sports and keep active, and if they cant reach a B average then they cant play sports then it wouldn't be good for those students. Also i think that its a bad idea to have a B average instead of a C because it takes a lot of work for students to reach a B average and they would be paying so much attention toward school work they wont have much time for other activities. i believe that yes there should be a goal set for students who want to be on sports teams but not as high as a B average.

1529F615275D,"Some scools offer distance learning as an option for students. In my opinion i think students would benifet from being able to take classes from home.

To begin with, students would have a less likely chance of being bullied because they feel more comfortable at home than out where someone can make fun of them for being differnet bullying is a big issue in schools and is one of the number one issues that lead to suicide and school shootings in americ. If students have can learn from home they would be less likely to face problems like that at home.

As a reslut, some students may be fighting anxiety or depression and can not deal with all the stress that come wwith school if they are more comtorable with being home, Then they are most likely better off being home or somewhere else learning where they can focus and not worr a whole lot about things.

Letting kids learn from a distance will also make the graduation rate go up because kids wont be together to skip and kids wont incourage other kids to do drugs as much.

Last but not least, students in a group together is not a good idea because of fights and arguments. Studies show people in a crowded area are more likely to fight than in a small are because not evryone are the same they dont share the same ideals. But if students can learn in a environment that they are comfotablle with with and are not a group fight it would also solve fights in schools.

In conclusion, as we can conclude students who have a chance to have distance learning have a higher chance of making the wrong choices in lifemlike being encouraged to do drugs and have a lower chance of being bullied. Some kids also have anxiety and deppresion as result students are better off learing from a distane without any worries.",0,persuade_corpus,,5
8281058A7684,"As an eighth-grade student, I have experienced the impact of effort on learning in two different ways: learning a language and playing video games. While both require a significant amount of effort, the results are vastly different.

Learning a language requires consistent effort and dedication. It involves memorizing vocabulary, grammar rules, and sentence structures. It also requires practicing speaking, listening, and writing in the language. My experience learning Spanish is a prime example of this. I spent hours studying the language, taking classes, and practicing my speaking skills. The more effort I put into learning, the better I became. I was able to understand and communicate in Spanish fluently after several months of consistent effort.

On the other hand, video gaming requires a different kind of effort. While it requires strategy and skill, it also requires a significant amount of time and practice. My experience with playing Fortnite is a prime example of this. I spent hours each day practicing my aim, building skills, and learning new strategies. The more effort I put into gaming, the better I became. I was able to compete at a professional level after several months of consistent effort.

While both learning a language and playing video games require effort, the results are vastly different. Learning a language requires consistent effort and dedication, while video gaming requires a significant amount of time and practice. In my experience, the effort I put into learning Spanish paid off with fluency, while the effort I put into playing Fortnite paid off with competitive skills.

In conclusion, effort plays a crucial role in learning, but the kind of effort required and the results obtained vary depending on the task. While both learning a language and playing video games require effort, the results are vastly different. Learning a language requires consistent effort and dedication, while video gaming requires a significant amount of time and practice.

The reason for this paper is that i would like to, participate in anything that is required to do. I want to help in the communities work. I want to help others and do something important. I want to have a good for my own good and others. I think that is important to help because we never know if we will need help later on. And also i think that is important to do good things for the community sense we live and are the community.

My idea is to help reading to little kids or even clean the school. i would like to help on something productive and on something that benefits all. the other thing that i personally think that is a good idea is to give food and water to people that do not have it. we can all donate food and gallons of water and then cook it and go to places where they really need the food and give it to them. I think that when we give we get the double of that.

i know that what we do is going to be for the best of all. we can even go and buy cloth and give it to poor children that need it. i know that there is maybe more than 10 kids this really need cloth and food, i know because two years ago i went on vacation to Mexico and I was being really selfish. My dad took me to an orphanage and i got to see how the poor kids lived in that horrible place and I imagine how it wold be if i lived there.

In response to that question, I believe that the future does have ideas for such things, Why?

So computer operrated cars are no shock to my eyes and ears, well until it actually happens...

I will begin talking about the risk being ensured, I say ensured because it is almost bound to happen to have reported accidents and or malfunctions.

In the article it mentions people testing out and making assumptions to these self driven cars. One statement caught my eye when saying ""They worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" That is one example of why we shouldn't be putting self driven cars on the road, they're going to be expensive and always needing an upgrade, what if you're driving, well your car is driving itself, and you run into an issue while on the road with others out there, could the car malfuntion and cause you to lose your life?

I do believe that people only do things because they feel as if they need to be up to date on what the new and improved inventions: Not saying I wouldn't have fun, but am I wiling to risk my life along with others?

There are some positive perks about these self drivin cars... One being The necessititaes the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention when the car is about to run into, on going traffic, construction sites, and or a route to which a human is needed to attend the wheel.

Have they thought about giving examples on when a good time to use these cars instead of an everday drive? I think more advice would help give a good responsible outlook on these cars.

These questions i asked would need to be answered before i ever think about buying, everyone needs to know the answers to these questions before not even thinking about all of the above.

B7468C4DD17C,"Pros and Cons of Attending a Normal School vs Distance Learning

Introduction

As technology continues to advance, distance learning has become increasingly popular. While it has its advantages, attending a regular school has its own benefits. In this essay, I will research and discuss the pros and cons of attending a regular school or distance learning.

Pros of Attending a Regular School

One of the main benefits of attending a regular school is the opportunity to interact with peers and teachers face-to-face. This allows for a more personalized learning experience, as teachers can provide immediate feedback and students can ask questions in real-time. Additionally, attending a regular school provides a sense of community, as students can participate in clubs and activities that they may not be able to do while learning remotely.

Cons of Attending a Regular School

However, attending a regular school also has its drawbacks. For example, it can be more expensive, as students may have to pay for transportation, uniforms, and other expenses. Additionally, attending a regular school can be more time-consuming, as students may have to wake up earlier and spend more time commuting.

Pros of Distance Learning

On the other hand, distance learning has its own advantages. For example, it can be more flexible, as students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, distance learning can be more affordable, as students do not have to pay for transportation, uniforms, or other expenses.

Cons of Distance Learning

However, distance learning also has its drawbacks. For example, it can be more difficult to interact with peers and teachers, as students may feel isolated and disconnected. Additionally, distance learning can be less structured, as students may struggle with self-discipline and motivation.

Real-Life Example

For example, let's say a student is interested in joining a school debate team. Attending a regular school would allow them to participate in the team and receive feedback from their coach and peers. However, if they were to learn remotely, they may not have the same opportunities to practice their skills and receive feedback.

Conclusion

In conclusion, both attending a regular school and distance learning have their own advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the decision of which option to choose will depend on the individual student's needs and preferences. However",1,llammistral7binstruct,,5

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains the dangers of exploring our sister planet, but he also explains why we should. The article gives that Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky but also unable to land on being that it is covered in a thick atomsphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide and covered in sulfuric acid clouds. He explains how ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because human curisoity will likely lead us to into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The pursuit of traveling to Venus is worth it since the knowledge that we'd gain and could possiably lead to other greater discoveries is to great to pass up.

The author explains the risk that apporach in traveling to Venus such as ""the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomshpere..."" If we were to take the challenge to travel,we have a possiablily of getting samples such as rocks and dirt and even the smallest bit will help our knowledge of our sister planet. The author also states ""... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" But the author provides us with ways to aviod this problem by creating a ""blimp-like vechicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" Proving that those who we'd send would be able to study but also protected from the planets sulferic acid clouds.

The pursuit of traveling to Venus is worth it since the knowledge that we'd gain and could possiably lead to other greater discoveries is to great to pass up. Though the dangers of the travel,we will have multipule opporutinites to gain insight on the planet. Which we many one day successfully live on with the knowledge collected if we choose the make this journey.                    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
FEFEDFE935D3,"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I am addressing you on the issue if all students at SCHOOL_NAME should be required to do community service. I believe that each student should need some community service hours. Each student should do something to benefit our community. At the same time they should not be required a ridiculous amount of hours if the student doesn't think they should do community service. My reasoning for this is this community gives there tax dollars for us to get the things we do at this school. The least we can do is give back by doing something like cleaning, daycare, tutoring, etc. When deciding on this issue students need to think about that. If it wasn't for our community we wouldn't be allowed to get the education that we are getting.

At the same time we do not need to have a surplus of hours put on a student to do. If passed a reasonable number of hours needs to be set. My reasoning for saying this is that if a student here wanted to do after school activates the community service does not need to interfere with things like sports and clubs. For example if I was on three teams witch I am and had to do twenty hours of community service, I would have a over planned schedule if I still planned on having exceptional grades So a student can be involved with those too witch I am a strong supporter of. This is my thoughts on this issue thank you for your time.

0CB3A4D9ABF9,"Everyday, students across the world attend school. Whether it's elementary, middle, or high school, millions of students obtain their education through learning. While many of these learners attend school in person, there are plenty of students who receive their education through online school. From video conferencing to special programs, these students do not physically attend school in-person. And with technology becoming more advanced and easier to use, many schools are beginning to offer these online learning services to their students, allowing them to learn from home. Students would not benefit from attending classes from home because they would get distracted, and they would not be engaged with their learning.

One reason why students would not benefit from attending classes at home is distractions. While having the leisure of working from home, students would also have the convenience of the accessing internet. With pressing a few keys on a keyboard, a student can go from attending an online class to watching a movie on an entertainment service. Another distraction that could occur is distractions in the home of the student. A student could have younger siblings that often create noise and be loquacious, which could interfere with their education. Also, as a high school student myself, I can conclude that the most distracting item that I hold is my cell phone. Not only is it entertaining, it is also very convenient to use. With attending school from home, not only can students access their cellular devices, but they can also use them freely with no higher authority disciplining them. These distractions can be crucial on a student, as well as their education.

Another reason why students would not benefit from attending classes at home is that they would not be engaged with their learning. Students could decided not participate in their online class, and there would be no one to hold them accountable. A higher authority is needed to keep students on track with their learning. Additionally, if students attended school from home, they wouldn't have any fellow students to interact with. A teacher of mine once said, ""It is not only the education that you gain from attending school. It's the connections that you make with friends, and the bonds that you build along the way."" Without companions and friends to work with, students would not feel as compassionate about school. However, these connections are not limited to just fellow students; building connections with teachers is important as well. Teachers can provide advice to their students about schoolwork and life, which could help a student forever.

While students would benefit from attending school in person, there are advantages to attending school online. Not only is it convenient for the students, but it is also convenient for the students' parents. Many public schools are controversial for parents, and it is understandable that they would rather have their child attend school from home. Online school would also be beneficial for students with transportation issues. Instead of walking to school or having to drive a far distance everyday, they could learn from home without any issues. However, online classes would not be easy for everyone. For students without financial support, they might not be able to attend school online, even if they wanted to. Laptops and computers are very expensive, and to buy them the student will need a copious amount of money.

There are plenty of benefits of attending either online school, or school in person. Online school provides the student with the leisure of working from home, and attending school in-person creates bonds with friends and teachers. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home, because they would get distracted easily and not be engaged with their learning. As a high school student that has physically attended school for 11 years, I have built many friendships and connections with teachers and other students that has helped my life exponentially. If I had attended school online, I do not believe that I would be where I am today.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,0
7A86A98F3909,"Facial Action Coding System is a potential and valuable way to read students' emotions while in class. Through the use of this technology, it could bring forth various opportunites. The system could open doors to the genuine thoughts of students to let adults better understand a view into their minds . Utilizing this technology will illustrate a positive change to the school by giving instructors insight to a students mental health, engagment with certain topics, and learning style.

The mental health of a student is a vital piece of information that a teacher should know. In the text, the author states that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that too"" (Alto 6). By writing this, he conveys to readers that the software can process your emotions. Therefore, if a student demonstrates a pattern of unhappy emotion, an administrator can then speak to the student and find out what might be going on in their home life or if they need to see a counselor. If a computer could give insight to happy or sad emotions, what other emotions could it detect?

The knowledge of how a student learns or the level of engagment they have within the classroom is a key component to modifying lessons and ensuring the most enriching education for a certain individual. Within the article, Alto inserts a quote from Thomas Huang, a professor, in which he says, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (Alto 6). This means that opportuinities for a student to get a more indivualized education increase, and teachers will have the ability to revise lessons in order to adjust to level of understanding majority of students have. It would also create a tremendous chance for the students who are falling below average to be identified and recieve the propering tutoring needed. Would these new adjustments then lead to a better understanding of learning styles?

Each individual in a classroom has a unique way of learning that requires attention and adaption on the lesson in order to fully let the student reach their potential to excell with their education. The author claims that the technology could, ""...modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Alto 6). This gives the information that the system could be able to analyze the way students learn, and give access to various learning styles of their student. This would enable them to then adhere to the students education needs, and therefore open doors to make break throughs with children that had been struggling.

There are many factors to consider when contemplating the use of this technology in the classroom. Although, the overall result of putting this system in place would be positive. The ability to detect students emotions will enable instructors to teach more attentively to each indivdual student, causing the childs achievement level to rise snd their education to strengthen. Enriching education and making it personal to the student will in time increase passing test scores, the number of college graduates, and literacy rate. Schools should consider encorperating the FACS technology in order to obtain a brighter, better future for their kids and country. ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
A20FCA71F224,"My thoughts on driverless cars are not necessarily against it but I think the world can do without for awhile still, in other words there's no rush to get them out into the public streets. Although it would be very luxurious to have a car the drives itself, the safety issues & tedious appliances still need much work. Google has had driverless cars since 2009 that drove more than half a million miles without crashing but these cars still require human occupation in complicated traffic situations & driveways. I think the smart road system working in hand with the driverless cars would be more efficient but too expensive & requires ""massive"" upgrades to the roads so the idea was disgarded. So being that the smart cars would be driving on the roads we know of now it would need a pretty excessive amount of sensors to mimic the skill of a human behind the wheel. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors in the left rear wheel, rotating senor on the roof, video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, inertial motion sensor, & the LIDAR on the roof that uses laser beams to project a 3D image of the car's surroundings. This is all so that in can mimic human driving ability as closely as possible & there's still much work to be done. BMW's development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" in 2013 was the 'better way' to go about having 'driverless' cars. This car was designed to drive itself standardly & notify the human driver inside when he or she needs to take over the wheel. Some might argue that having a driverless car that still needs you to drive is pointless so the ideas of in-car entertainment & information systems are going around. The ideas of these cars definitely are revolved around luxury & safety but new traffic laws would have to be made for these automobiles driving themselves because if an accident happens who is to blame? I believe there is still more troubleshooting to be as far as having a driverless car on the streets. Most states have even made it illegal to test computer-driven cars with the exception of California, Nevada, Florida, & the District of Columbia who allow limited use of semi-autonomous cars. After these cars are proved to be safe overall, then they will be introduced into the public streets. ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

The Facial Action Coding System improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of humans and detects how people truly feel even when they are trying to hide their emotions. Facial Action Coding System would be effective and valuable in reading emotional expressions of students in the classroom because;

Classroom computers would be able to know when they need to modify the lesson when they notice the students look bored or confused and that could make learning more effective to students. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it would modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This shows how learning can be made much more easier and fun.

The facial action coding system would be effective in classrooms because it would make computer-animated faces more expressive when teaching. ""The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery, most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication"". Sometimes muscle clues might be wrong because sometimes people might not be able to indicate a genuine smile and a forced one but facial action coding system would be able to detect when students are happy and when they are lying.

""Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"".

A79CF9AC2B58,"Teachers give you projects you don't want to do¬†because the topic is too hard or you don't have interest in it is the worst feeling ever. Students should be able to decided what projects they complete¬†during the summer break because it would mean more to them, if they could pick a topic they savior.

Students should design their own summer projects; we all know that projects can be very challenging and time consuming. However, it gives students an activity to do over the summer break rather than staring at the walls or playing on their PlayStation, Xbox¬†or laptops all summer. When students design their projects they will most likely remember to do these projects if they had the power to create them. Therefore, students will produce greater and better projects and put more time and¬†effort into them.

Therefore, allowing these projects to be students designs would be unquestionably beneficial for the students. Teachers would make these projects too hard and students will lose interest in doing it. Students can pick any topic as they please; forcing a student on a topic is not good, it will lead them to not having any ideas or them being stuck on a topic and worst: them not finishing the project. With the freedom of design students can have a topic on the solar system, school food, phone usage in class and bullying. It gives them the opportunity¬†to do creative things with their work. Student designed projects gives them more space and freedom to develop an idea and put more effort into the project so they can get the credit they desire.

As a result, although many teachers worry that over the summer break, students will forget about most of what they have learned during the school year. The solution is to assign students projects over the summer that the students can design , so they can maintain knowledge and be ready for the next school year.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,6

While some argue that a three-year program would be beneficial for students, others believe that it would have negative consequences. In this essay, I will investigate the motivations, qualifications, and advantages of offering a three-year high school program, as well as the potential drawbacks and disadvantages.

One of the main motivations for offering a three-year program is to provide students with an opportunity to enter the workforce sooner. By completing high school in three years, students would be able to start earning a salary and gaining valuable work experience at an earlier age. This could be particularly beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing a career that requires practical experience, such as construction or manufacturing.

Another advantage of a three-year program is that it would reduce the cost of education for students and their families. With a shorter high school program, students would be able to graduate and enter the workforce sooner, which could help to reduce the amount of student loan debt they would accrue. Additionally, a shorter high school program would mean that students would be able to start earning a salary sooner, which could help to alleviate some of the financial pressures that many families face.

However, there are also potential drawbacks and disadvantages to offering a three-year high school program. One of the main concerns is that a shorter high school program may not provide students with enough time to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in college or the workforce. While some students may be able to complete their coursework in three years, others may need more time to master certain concepts or to pursue additional interests or extracurricular activities.

Another potential disadvantage of a three-year program is that it may not be as attractive to colleges and employers. Many colleges and employers require a four-year high school diploma as a minimum qualification, and a three-year diploma may not be seen as equivalent. This could limit the opportunities available to students who choose to pursue a three-year program, and could make it more difficult for them to advance in their careers.

In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to offering a three-year high school program. While a shorter program could provide students with an opportunity to",1,llammistral7binstruct,,8
D42B6354404D,"Hey, Mr. Principal!  I'm here to convince you that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. I know you're probably thinking, ""But won't they get distracted from their studies?"" or ""What if they get injured and can't focus in class?"" But let me tell you, having the opportunity to participate in sports and activities can actually help students achieve their goals, both academically and personally.

First of all, it's important to understand that trying hard and making good decisions go hand in hand. When students are involved in sports and activities, they learn how to set goals and work towards them. They also learn how to make sacrifices and prioritize their time, which can help them stay focused on their studies. In fact, studies have shown that students who participate in sports and activities tend to have better grades and higher graduation rates than those who don't.

But it's not just about academics. Participating in sports and activities can also help students develop important life skills, like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. These skills can help them succeed in whatever they want to do in life, whether it's playing a sport professionally or starting a business. And let's not forget the social benefits! Being part of a team or club can help students make new friends and build a sense of community, which can be really hard to find in school.

Now, I know some of you might be thinking, ""But what about the risk of injury? Won't students get hurt if they're playing sports?"" And yes, it's true that there is a risk of injury when playing sports. But that's also true of any activity that involves risk, like driving a car or riding a bike. The important thing is to take safety precautions and make sure students are properly trained and equipped to handle the risks. And if they do get injured, they can still continue to participate in other activities, like cheering from the sidelines or volunteering in the school community.

In conclusion, allowing students who have a B average or higher to play sports and participate in activities can actually help them achieve their goals and become better students. It's not just",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

64077B385B48,"Taking in multiple people's advice can benefit you in a variety of ways. As an example, most people take in more than one persons advice to see which would be the best advice for them,

Because some people give better advice than others. Another reason why people go to multiple people for advice is because, people thrive off of others opinion, you may not see it but when you give or take in others advice it can really benefit you or the significant other you gave advice to .Taking in multiple others advice is a plus because it helps you when you don't know what you want to do and it gives you options to choose from.

Roman philosopher Cicero said ""no one can give you wiser advice than yourself"",

But thats not necessarily true. Most people strive off of others ideas. Students at school have guidance counselors and teachers that they take advice from all of the time, and mostly it benefits them in numerous ways. Another benefit for asking more than one person for advice is one person may give you bad advice on purpose, but if you have a second option to go to hopefully you can figure out the best one.

When I was about seven or eight me and my sister had psychologists, We would both talk to one of the psychologists at a time kind of in a rotation. They would both give different advice and one was not always better than the the others. Taking in advice from both of them really benefited me, they both had different ideas of what I should do. Yes I was only eight years old but I could understand where both of them were coming from. And I had multiple ideas to choose from, But sometimes I didnt really like the advice that they me so I went to mom for some I ideas.

Advice does not always have to be about your personal life though, Say your at the store with your friends. And you say ""do you think i should buy this shirt"" theres always gonna be that one friend that says ""yeah

''you have the money"". But theres gonna be your other friend that says ""can you picture yourself wearing it because i know that if i dont love it in the store it's gonna just sit in my closet"" that actually happened to me once. I went with friends idea and saved a little bit of money doing so.

All and all taking advice from multiple people at once benefits citizens in numerous ways even me.

when you take in in multiple others advice it is a plus, because it helps you when you do not know what you want to do and it gives you options to choose from. If you talk to more than one person for advice it may mean that you were unsure of the advice you were given the first time. I suggest you talk to multiple people before you make a decision especially if it is a big decision.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

I know that you are a little conflicted on the decision of banning cell phones from school, or not. I am writing to tell you my opinion on cell phones. Maybe it will help you make a decision, and also see the situation from my point of view.

I believe that cell phones should be aloud in school and for multiple reasons. One reason they should be aloud is because people need their cell phones. I am not talking about the fact that we must have our cell phones or we would 'die', but the fact that we need them for emergencies. If we didn't have our cell phones, how will we know if family emergencies occur. Or even if our parents are not home so we have to stay at another house. We may also need our phones for 911 emergencies, and even to call home to say that your going to be late. Our phone is our life line of sorts. We need them for way more reasons than texting, listening to music, or making 'petty little phone calls' as you say.

So in conclusion, I think that you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during their free time. As long as they have their phone turned off in class. It's giving them free rein, but with limits.

Many big names that specialize in different aspects of technology are working on driverless cars. Some of the biggest are Google, BMW, and Tesla. People have long dreamed of driverless cars, and in the 1950s GM tried ""smart roads"" as a solution, but was soon disregarded because of the cost.

Almost all the successful driverless cars have been producted by big successful companies that are household names. Google is highly respected and is working on a driverless cars, and in total those cars have driven more than half a million miles. In those half a million miles not a single crash has happened. BMW is also helping solve problems with driverless cars by intoducing ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This new technology requires the driver to have their hands on the wheel as the car drives itself in case the person is needed to take over. Also Toyota has helped set the templet for Google's smart car by producing the Toyota Prius.

The knowledge of how to design a smart car has been around for a long time, but the technology is just now letting us build our dream car. Improvments on technology and cheaper technology makes it easier to build a smart car. An example of technology that has under gone this transformation are all the different sensors in cars. This technology is also making cars safe like an antilock break.

People have long dreamed of driverless cars, and the human race is known for making dreams into realality. For a long time driverless cars have only been seen in television shows and movies, but now big name companies are working hard to solve the probelms that face smart cars to make it come true. This dream is nothing new, and was first tested in 1950s by GM.

B864F3DC71FC,"Advice is a good thing to ask for when you are unsure about a decision you want to make. Many people believe that you should only ask one person for advice when you have a problem, but I disagree strongly. Asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice, for it can keep you from making mistakes, make your decision easier to make, and help you see others point of view.

To begin with, making a mistake is not a hard thing to do in this world, just one wrong word and there is a big problem. Sometimes, you might think that you are doing something right, but end up hurting another persons feelings. This is a reason why asking for advice from others is a good thing to do. For example, you get into an argument with your friend because you accidentally said something that hurt their feelings, so you ask for advice from your other friends to refrain from making the same mistake as before.

Also, when you ask for advice it not only helps stop you from making mistakes, it makes your decision easier to make. Some decisions are really hard to make especially when it comes to the people you care about. Which is another reason that asking others for advice is very important. When you have others to help debate on which choice is the best for you, it makes the decision way easier for you to make. For instance, after you ask for advice you and the people giving you advice could talk about it, to help you realize the best choice to make.

Lastly, other peoples point of view is very important when it come to confrontation. When you¬†are arguing with someone, you might think you are right in the moment but realize how wrong you were later. When you ask for others advice they might give you the point of view of the person you were arguing with. In a typical case, you tell your friends your side of the story and they help inform you on the other persons point of view to help you understand that not everything that you said or did was not the right thing to do in that situation.

In conclusion, no one knows what to say or do in every situation , and that is why asking for others advice is important. They are not going to all say the same thing but that is the best part about it. With all the different opinions being thrown at you it can help, keep you from making mistakes, make your decision easier, and help you see others point of view.¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9

My reason why I am writing this letter is because many people want to participate in sports but they have a C's and want participate in the sports but they can't because of their grade. Many students are complaining about not letting them play in a sport. They want to improve their grade and try their best to get at least get a B's. If they had at least the B's they would get in the sport they want to get in. Some students try their best but cant reach their goals of getting a better grade. They say that it is to hard. I think that they should leave the students focus on their grade and leave them play for one week and the other week study to try there best and reach their goals. If u let them join in the sport that they really want probably they could hire there grade. They might also give you more reasons why they would want to play in a sport.

Another reason why you should let students play in sports is because it is healthy for your body and also good because u can focus to being a better student instead of being in other places not learn

29BCE8906E8E,"TEACHER_NAME:

When you were a child did you ever have classmates who got away with lower than average grades and still did activities?

This is how us B or higher grade average students feel. Student should have good grades to participate in anything. C average students are already on the verge of failing and do not have limitations to what they can do. This is like an example of letting a little boy hit his sister and get away with it because he ""didn't mean to"". Children who don't succeed should have a punishment, without a punishment they won't learn and will keep behaving the wrong way, and therefore, still get away with it. People have to learn, and if they don't learn right the first time it will become a bad habit of failing.

Parents should have to sign a paper, as well as teachers with the grade on it. Thus, if the grade is lower than an average B they shall not be able to participate. And there must be a parent/ teacher conference regarding the grade, how it got there, and how it can be fixed to let them do activities. If the requirements aren't met then the parent, and student should have a conference with the teacher and talk about what is wrong.

Children who work hard deserve to have a break and do something they want. But with C grade average people participating in those activities, C average students should have some limitations for what they are not doing right. When children do something wrong they must go in time out. So when a student fails, they must pay for what they did by not being able to participate in activities that are fun and interesting like sports and dances.

When children fail they must pay the consequences, and in this case, not be able to participate in school activities. It is not fair to the children at the school who do get good grades and participate to have to know they spend much more time working to perfect a grade just to participate with classmates who don't work half as hard and still participate.

2CBE6AD55BDD,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure learning over break. Should the summer projects be teacher designed or student designed. First the projects should be student designed, it shows more responsibility, creativity and effort. Second it gives the students' a better experience and shows different aspects of learning. Student designed projects will help the students' when they get older and move on to college and will have to do all of their work on their own.

First, the projects designed by the students show tremendous¬†responsibility, creativity and effort. The student designed projects leave the students to do it on there own; they have to worry about they want to write, what they want to prove or what they need to show. This shows the student responsibility because it's a school project over the summer that they have to complete, which most students will not even attempt to try . They will have to do the project during their own free time. And do a little of it everyday until it's complete. They can't wait last minute to do the project because it will show when they turn the project in and get a bad grade. The project show's creativity, the students or making the project and didn't get a teacher designed project. They have to come up with the whole project by themselves with only a topic to start with. The students need a creative thought process to get the project done, and in a timely manner. The project shows effort by being able to complete it and doing it right the first time, by being able to sit down and do a school project that need's to be done and you're stuck doing it during the summer. It takes a lot¬†of effort to do a project over the summer, which is your biggest break you have off school and the most busy break for some students with sports, traveling with your family and work.

Second, it gives the students' a better experience¬†doing the project themselves and it can show different aspects of learning. It's a better experience doing it themselves because the project has to be complete by them, which is what they will have to do when they go off to college. They are not going to be able to get help from their professors' and the professors' are not going to design projects' for them¬†in college they are going to have to learn to do it on their own. Which is a great learning opportunity for students' because it's not easy doing a project yourself and it takes practice to be able to make a good project. Doing projects can also show you different aspects of learning, By having to look up information for your project, having to do research on your topics for you to be able to complete your project. There might be some things you can't find to finish your project so you have to find valid resources, witnesses or read because¬†you can't find anything you need¬†on the internet, which shows a different aspect of learning because everything is on the internet nowadays.

I believe student designed projects would be a better learning perspective than teacher designed projects. Students have always got assignments by teachers and have to complete them how the teachers want them completed, the projects do over the summer is a different experience there is no teacher there to tell you what to do it's all on the student, his or her views on the subject. The student can use all of the sources they find and put it into one project that wouldn't be like other class mates because they get to write about what they would like too. The teacher assigned project is not a good idea, the students will just copy and paste and can't do anything on their own. The students will have the same information because they all got the same project from the teacher. Therefore student assigned projects or better for both teachers' and students'.

Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure learning over break. Should the summer projects be teacher designed or student designed. The student designed projects are a better way for students to learn responsibility, creativity, effort and also help learn different aspects of learning for when they go off too college.

I Think that cell phone should not be at school for many reason but one reason would be why do u even did your phone at school when your friends are their. what I don't understand is when cell phone are such a problem at school. I know kids think they have better plans then school but i think they should have some thing to decision them also .

Cell phone shouldn't be used during school because their many thing u can do to get your self in trouble. Cell phone been the number one thing that get kids in trouble at school the reason for this is because student are texting in class. which make no nice to me I mean if its that important then it can be told out side in the hall way.

what student don't realizes is that we don't wanted to be mean to us student but we just don't wanted any cheating on test.

B091F6AFF43F,"School is a place where students can come and learn from educators who are experts in the field that they teach. Students come to school in order to learn material from them and to gain a better understanding of concepts that would be difficult to learn on their own. They use teachers in order to help them learn certain key concepts. Students attending classes online would not benefit them in any way, proving that learning in a traditional classroom setting is far more beneficial to the students than taking the classes online.

The first reason why attending classes from home is a bad idea is because students learn better when they are able to communicate with others. For instance, learning from a teacher in person is more helpful because a student can ask follow up questions and get answers instantly. When learning a hard concept about chemistry, my friend was not able to fully understand the concept and needed additional information. My friend then asked follow up questions about the topic, and the teacher was able to address the issue and resolve any further misunderstandings. My friend would not have been able to get an answer that fully explains the topic if he had to learn it online without being able to properly communicate to a teacher. This situation explains the need for a teacher, because online, help would not have been provided at the exact moment when my friend needed help. Students also need to be able to communicate with other classmates in order to understand things if the teacher is not explaining a topic in a way that is understandable to every student. In biology, my teacher was not able to explain it in a way that my friend would understand. Due to this, others around the friend attempted to help teach the concept to him to help him better understand the topic. This is an important factor of schools, one that would be lost from distance learning. Without collaborating with others, certain people might not understand important topics. Communicating with others will help students learn better, which would be lost if distance learning was implemented.

Another reason why attending in person classes can benefit a student better is it gives them access to new materials and encourages them to learn the material. In person, people have papers and worksheets provided to them by a teacher that will properly address the topic and give them practice to learn the material. When my friend was talking an online class, he didn't have papers or notes that explained concepts to him. He had to search¬†through the internet in order to find explanations, but he wasn't able to find a source that would explain it to him properly. In a classroom setting, a student would have access to notes given to them by the teacher that could address any mistakes and give them an easy way to understand a concept. Online teaching often doesn't provide understandable notes that simplify the content because the content is addressed to people of either higher or lower skill levels. A teacher would be able to evaluate the skill level of a student and give them worksheets according to the skill level of the student. A student will also better learn material if they have to learn it in a classroom. In an economy class, students are forced to learn the topics on their own by reading a textbook at home and taking notes. The teacher does not check to see if the student completes the notes, and this leads to many students not attempting to read the textbook. If the teacher had made them take notes in class, the students would have had to complete the task and they would be motivated to finish because they wouldn't want to have to do them at home. Students would rather complete assignments in class than have to do them at home. Therefore, distance learning is not beneficial since students would have access to new material and would be encouraged to learn if they do it in a classroom.

The final reason why distance learning wouldn't be beneficial is because students would feel more comfortable learning in a classroom environment than learning at home. At school, students realize that they are there to learn and so they make use of the time they spend their by absorbing the information they get. At home, students would feel stressed and would not be able to learn because they have a different mindset at home. Personally, when I am at school, I learn better because the environment around me encourages me to learn. At home, that opportunity is taken away because I am more likely to do activities that will not help me learn rather than sitting down and taking time to learn important concepts. Learning at home, people would not feel any pressure to learn because no one is able to make sure that they work, and a school environment prevents that. By taking the time to go to school, students are better equipped to learn properly. At home they would do activities that would take time away from learning. That is why a comfortable space such as school allows students to learn better than if they were to learn at home.

In person learning, or traditional learning, is far more beneficial to students than online learning. Attending classes in person allows people to communicate with others to learn the material better. It also allows people to have access to worksheets or new material, and encourages them to learn the concepts. The other reason why students wouldn't benefit from attending classes at home is that they would feel more comfortable learning in a classroom environment. Schools were created to benefit students and to help them learn and in person schooling benefits them more than distance learning.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

5B0F0C4C998D,"School and education has come a long way from when it first started hundreds of years ago. Us students now have many resources we can use to attain our educational goals and strive as scholars. With that being said getting education online is a new branch off the tree to get students the education they need. Students can benefit from having their classes online or by video conferencing because it can give students more time to do extracurricular activities, it can relieve stress from some students, and teachers jobs can become easier and they won't be as tired.

One of the main goals in high school is to get students to push past their barriers and to get them out of their comfort zones. Schools want their kids to do sports and join clubs, but one of the reasons that they won't is because it takes to much time and commitment out of their day. They won't be able to balance their athletic lives with their school lives. Online classes that you attend from home would possibly influence more kids to try new sports and clubs, and it could open up a new world for student athletes to give them a sense of balance in their lives.

An underlying problem in all schools is the feeling of stress within the students. Most students feel that they recieve to much work from their teachers to do in a short amount of time and get pressured that they might not get it done. Although you cannot fully eliminate stress, online classes from home could help this cause by opening up more time for assignments to get done.

Teachers have a schedule they need to follow in class to make sure that the students learn all the material they need to by the end of the school year. This leads to alot of homework, projects, and tests which students aren't faund of, but i'm sure teachers feel the same way. The teachers are the ones that have to take the time to stay after school to help students and grade all the assignments that they assign, and i'm sure that's taxing and takes a toll on them. Online classes would help the problem with teachers grading. Making it easier and quicker for teachers to send feedback. Video conferencing would make life much more easier for teachers to help students, and it also gives them the luxery to do it in their own home.

The ways people can get their education has evolved so much over time that I feel we have to take advantage of it. Attending classes from home can help student athletes balance out their time and get more work done, it can relieve stress from students and not feel pressured by time restrictions to get work done, and the teachers job can become a whole lot easier because they can help students by video conferencing from home, and they can give faster feedback on work. In total all leading to a great and healthy school experience for the students and the teachers.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
85D7C9ADFE4F,"School can be an extremely stressful place. The halls are full of people who walk slow, students have to wake up really early just to make their bus, and having to sit in a class for an hour and a half doesnt seem that appealing. Some students think that school should start up half days or give us more breaks, but students need to get an education and keep their brain functioning, academic wise. Having another alternative to keep kids thinking while being lenient on their health and feelings would make things easier for teachers, parents, and students of course. So yes, students would 100% benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, it would be a lot easier for them to get to class on time and not miss any essential information,and they wouldn't be as tired because they would be sleeping in more, since they don't have to catch an early bus.

Missing notes or even a day of class, could really make a difference in a students performance. It turns into the snowball effect. You miss one day of class, you come back the next day and the class is already working on day 2 of the lesson, you have no idea what's going on. Let's say, you do the work you missed, but you don't seem to understand it, you would continue to struggle and try to keep up with the class while the the work load keeps piling up. This situation could be avoided if schools provided an online or a video conferencing learning option. Students would actively engage in the conversation which would help them understand the material better. Being late to class would never be a problem, because lessons would be recorded if students can't make the call, so no one would miss a thing.

Having online classes would help students get the sleep they need since they wouldn't have to wake up early in the morning to catch a bus. Some students live far away from school, which means students would have to wake up really early, probably after a long night studying or completing homework, to start their morning routine. To then catch a bus, or drive themselves to school which can be even more draining. When they get to school, it would be difficult to focus, or even stay awake in class due to their lack of sleep. Having online classes could prevent that. Yes, there would be specific time to join the conference call, or to watch a lesson and complete the work, but essentially the fatigue students have would be gone and they would be able to participate, understand, and comprehend the information they're learning.

Maybe people dont want the traditional way of school to change, and they enjoy getting up early and sitting in class to learn, but a lot of students would benefit from this alternative and their performance would improve if schools offer online classes that could be attended from home, for some of their subjects. If schools decide to do this, it would be a lot easier for students to get to class on time, not miss any essential information,and they would be awake and fully energized to learn.¬†   ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,2

So, have you ever thought about how imagination is way more important than knowledge? Like, think about it. Knowledge is cool and all, but it's not as cool as being able to imagine something and make it a reality. Like, have you ever seen a building that was designed by someone who just drew it in their head? It's like, whoa! ü§Ø

And don't even get me started on math. Like, sure, it's important to know how to calculate stuff and all, but where would we be without imagination? We wouldn't have things like video games or roller coasters or anything fun! üéÆüé¢

And drawing and designing? Same thing. Without imagination, we wouldn't have all those awesome artists and designers who create stuff that's just, like, wow. üé®üî•

Extracurricular activities can be fun because there are so many options. Now the principal proposed, ""All students are required to be in a extracurricular activities."" I agree with his proposal, because you can obtain relationships, stay active, and it would give you a general sense of skill.

For starters, you could have amazing relationships with others. In time those friendships could help you out in the future. You never know if the friend you make will be a celebrity and you could be well known because of them. Through tough times or just for entertainment, it brightens up life to have someone with you.

Second, it would keep you active. Its better to be active than laying on the couch all day doing nothing. It is a known fact that staying active can lead to a longer life span. If you stay active on a daily basis you can be more mobile, and not have to sit in a wheel chair everywhere they go. staying active is something tat keeps your mood up even without you knowing.

Third, it would help with life skills in general. If you needed a job, the skills you learned with the extracurricular activity you did in middle school will help you out. Multiple extracurricular activities look good on collage applications, so when you are applying for a scholarship. And if you have skills you could teach others.

In conclusion, having extracurricular activities as a requirement is great because of the friendships, the general sense of skill, and the fact of being active whether it is your brain that is working or your physical body.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,7

This policy would let the students to get good grades on there test. Students have the rest of the day after school to use there phone and text.

8fef4536,"The Electoral College should be kept for the voting of the President. There are many reasons to support this conclusion. When the people vote for a President, they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This can be a good and bad thing. The good thing is that the Electoral College keeps balance. The bad part is that some Americans see that is unfair that they cannot vote for a President directly.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance between small and large states as it says in paragraph 21. This means that it makes sure the election is fair, not one person can be voted president just because they campaigned in a larger state more people. The Electoral College also balances out the winners. They are the people who pick the clear winner when two candidates get tied. This happened to Nixon and Clinton. They both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes as it says in paragraph 22. In these kind of situations it is good to have a backup plan also known as the Electoral College.

Although the Electoral College is a helpful and fair way to vote, some Americans do not see it that way. In fact,over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now as it says in paragraph 9. There reasoning is that they cannot vote directly. They vote for a slate of electors who then vote for the president. They see this as unfair and think that they should be able to vote for the president directly. Below the 14th paragraph, it says ""lost the presidency: In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide,but Bush won the election,receiving 271 electoral votes to Gores 266."" Although this may seem unfair, the reality of it is that the Electoral College is just trying to keep the election for President fair. The Electoral College help to ensure that all of the candidates for President have a fair advantage. If the Electoral College wasnt there to balance out the voting, then the candidates could cheat. By cheat, this means that they could campaign in a bigger place of they could be from a different place than another president and have a unfair advantage because of the bigger population. If one president was from Texas and the other was from Florida, the candidate from Texas would have a unfair advantage because hes from a place with a bigger population. Why this is unfair is because if a candidate is from a area with a big population, the people in that area are most likely going to vote more towards that candidates side. In the last sentence of paragraph 21, it says ""Alarge state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than small states."" In the end, there are always going to be downfalls. The Electoral College may pick the opposite candidate that the majority of the people want, this is true. Also, the people may feel that it is wrong to not go with the peoples opinion. If the Electoral College was not there to decide, there would be all forms of chaos. As it says 1822, the candidates would have an unfair advantage.

The electors are the people that make the final decision,Dispite however the popular vote takes place and whoever gets the most majoraty of the votes,The Electoral vote is the most impotant voting process.

Richard A. Posner states that ""it is the electors who elect the president,not the people.

Seeking advice in the first place can give you a different view on the problem you are trying to solve. But seeking multiple opinions will give you perspectives from all angles. Thus, you will know how it will affect you and other people. Seeking advice from people can also tell you what not to do. If they have been in that same situation before, they can tell you what worked and what didn't work for them. This could give you an idea of what you should try and what you shouldn't try. Seeking opinions helps people make better choices.

For example, if Generic_Name wanted to know how she was going to build a bridge, she wouldn't just consult herself. This would leave out input and opinions from other people. She would consult with other people. She would consult with engineers, the community, pedestrians, and environmentalists for opinions. She would consult with an engineer so she would know what made up a sturdy bridge. She would consult with the community because they would be the ones driving over the bridge. They would also help her decide how many lanes would be on the bridge. She would also consult pedestrians because if they wanted to walk over the bridge, there should be a special walkway so they don't get run over. And lastly, she would consult environmentalists so she would have the least amount of impact on animal habitats and wildlife. In order to fully understand building a bridge, she would have to consult with many different people. After concerns were brought up, she would try to attack them from all angles. It would be easier on her because she would know the concerns of the community and how it will affect them. After talking with the engineer, she would know a sturdy design and to implement it she would need advice of a construction company. After Generic_Name is done building the bridge, she will be very knowledgeable because she consulted with so many different groups and parties.

You are changing school policy so student that have a C average can not participate in sports or other activities unless the students have at least a B average .I think that students that have a C average should at least have an extra class that they need help in so they can pull up their grades up so the students can participate in sports or activities. If the teachers of the student think that they are working hard to bring their grades up at least the principal should give the students 30 minutes of free time on the activities or sports they want to participate in.

I hear that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy due to complaints within the school. I believe that students should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch and free times as long as they are off during class because it will give students a greater sense of freedom and they aren't really causing any trouble outside of class time.

To begin with, I think we as students should be allowed to use cell phones during time out of class because it would give us a greater sense of freedom. Often times, we don't have lunch with our friends or even people that we know. And since we're not allowed to move lunch tables or classes during free time, we should be able to talk to our friends. I'm not going to lie and say we don't already use them during these times, but one of the reasons we use them is because they are banned. When students think they aren't given enough freedom, we often do exactly what we're not supposed to do. If we were allowed to have them during school, then we would be less likely to abuse the use of cell phones in school. Socialization is a key component to how we will grow and survive in life. If we don't have the ability to talk to people, then how can we be expected to continue growing and maturing? With the help of a new cell phone policy, our generation could grow socially and help make a very unconnected society connect on a more personal level.

Secondly, I believe students should be allowed to have phones during school as long as they're off during class because outside of the classroom, they really aren't doing any harm. If you think back, the reason cell phones were originally banned from school was because kids were using them to cheat on tests and class work. So why do they need to be banned during free time and lunch? I, personally, don't really think they do. It's not like we can cheat on what we're going to eat for lunch or what book we're reading. So let us use ours phones in the time that's given to us specifically every day so we have a break in our schedules. With the new policy, students still wouldn't be allowed to cheat, but we'd also be allowed to talk to our friends.

In conclusion, I believe students should be allowed to use their phones during lunch and free time as long as they're off during class. For one thing, it will give us a greater sense of freedom. Plus, they're not really doing any harm outside of class. so please consider changing the cell phone policy to policy one.

61471CA2532D,"It is a well-known fact that people have different personalities. Some people are outgoing and extroverted, while others are introverted and reserved. These differences in personality can have a significant impact on how people interact with each other.

One reason why people can have a bad day is due to their personality traits. For example, an introverted person may feel overwhelmed by social situations and may struggle to connect with others. On the other hand, an extroverted person may become easily frustrated or agitated in high-pressure situations.

However, it is important to note that people can also have bad days due to external factors such as stress, anxiety, or a difficult situation. These factors can affect anyone, regardless of their personality traits.

Despite this, people can change their first impressions of others. This is because first impressions are often based on superficial factors such as appearance or behavior. By getting to know someone on a deeper level, we can form a more accurate understanding of their personality and character.

It is also important to remember that people can change their own behavior and attitudes. For example, an introverted person may work on developing their social skills in order to feel more comfortable in social situations. Similarly, an extroverted person may work on managing their stress and anxiety in order to handle high-pressure situations more effectively.

In conclusion, people have different personalities, and these differences can have a significant impact on how people interact with each other.

llama_70b_v1960,"I believe that arts education should be considered essential for a well-rounded education. While some may argue that it should be optional, I strongly believe that it plays a crucial role in a child's development and learning.

Firstly, arts education helps to develop a child's creativity and imagination. Through various forms of art such as painting, drawing, music, and drama, children are able to express themselves and explore their imagination. This is important as it allows children to think outside the box and come up with unique solutions to problems. In a world that is rapidly changing, it is important for children to be able to think creatively and adapt to new situations.

Secondly, arts education helps to improve a child's critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Through the study of art, children are able to analyze and evaluate different forms of art, which helps to develop their critical thinking skills. They are also able to learn about different techniques and methods used by artists, which helps to improve their problem-solving skills.

Thirdly, arts education helps to enhance a child's communication skills. Through the study of art, children are able to communicate their ideas and emotions effectively. This is important as it allows children to express themselves in a meaningful way and connect with others.

Furthermore, arts education helps to promote cultural awareness and appreciation. Through the study of different forms of art, children are able to learn about different cultures and traditions. This helps to promote cultural awareness and appreciation, which is important in today's diverse society.

Finally, arts education has been shown to have a positive impact on a child's academic performance. Studies have shown that children who participate in arts education tend to perform better in other subjects such as math and language. This is likely due to the fact that arts education helps to develop a child's creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, which can be applied to other subjects.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that arts education should be considered essential for a well-rounded education. It helps to develop a child's creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, enhances their communication skills, promotes cultural awareness and appreciation, and has a positive impact on their academic performance. Therefore, I believe that arts education should be a mandatory part of a child's education.",1,llama_70b_v1,"Many people believe that arts education is essential for a well-rounded education, while others think that it should be optional.

I think that its a good idea to make sure students are passing all their classes with good grades in order for them to join any sports, but I also think that it would be better if you only did that with the kids that get in trouble constantly because I think that would keep the students from getting in trouble, and then when they stop getting in trouble then you could tell them that in order for them to join any sports they would have to be passing all their classes with a B or higher. After you have talked to those students and they still miss behave then you would have to take them out of the sport they wanted to be in. Once you take them out and they know your being serious about it then they will get good grades and behave so they can continue playing the sport they wanted to join.

You should also talk to the students that don't get in trouble because some are really good students and they still don't have good grades, but they really want to join a sport so maybe you can convince them to come to tutoring or to come get help after school, so that way they can have good grades and join the sport that they want to join.

Now i know that you are suppose to be overseeing that we obtain a great education. I also know that you think that we should give our full attention to teachers. The only problem is many students complain that their learning gets dry and boring and they need a little bit of excitement in their learning to stay focused. So why not let us use our phones during times when we aren't listening to a teacher! To me i really don't see a big problem with letting us use our phones in hall-ways or on our free periods of time. One good reason i can think of, of letting us have our phones is, what if we just got out of math class and we just learned something new? When we got out of class though we started to lose bits and pieces of the information you just learned, so why not text your friends tips and questions you can use to keep that information in your mind.

Another reason i think we should be aloud to have phones is to loosen our minds if it's tense! Let's say you just got out of one of your classes and had an extremely hard test, and you want to open up your mind a little to let go of some of the stress from that test. Well maybe you need to talk to someone that's on the other half of the school but your next class is on a different half from that person. You can't speak to them physically unless you want to be late, but if you have your cellular device you can communicate with them and that might just help ease your nerves for the next period.

A last reason that i personally think is the most important reason to have a phone at school is for safety/issues. Let's say you have try-outs for a sport and the coach says your ride has to pick you up by a certain time. You forget to let your parents or whoever is picking you up what time they have to be at the school, well if you have your phone you could always call/text that person and your situation may be resolved. Now let's say your at school and a intruder invades the school and the school resource officer is no where to be found! What do you do? Here's a suggestion, ""call"" someone to help, You never know what could happen to you so why take the chance of not having a method of communication to help you out? I hope that you take these words into consideration and hopefully allow us to have our phones out during our free time.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,8

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider its benefits when contemplating any potential changes to the current system of electing the President of the United States.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote by qualified citizens. Its process involves the selection of electors, the voting by electors for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President (What Is the Electoral College?).

While critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair and undemocratic, there are several practical reasons why it should be retained. Firstly, the certainty of outcome is higher with the Electoral College. Although disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. Due to the winner-take-all system in each state, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote (Posner, 18).

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President has a trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, meaning candidates must appeal to a diverse range of states and regions. This results in a President who represents the interests and concerns of the entire nation, rather than just a specific region (Posner, 19).

Moreover, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This allows voters in these states to have a more direct impact on the election and encourages candidates to address the specific concerns of these states (Posner, 20).

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large states against small states. Although the popular vote may be close in a large state, the winner receives a significant number of electoral votes, ensuring their attention and consideration for the concerns of that state. This prevents smaller states from being overlooked in the electoral process (Posner, 21).

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This reduces the complexity and cost of the election process while still producing a clear and decisive winner (Posner, 22).

It is important to note that voter turnout is not significantly affected by the Electoral College. Despite the fact that individual votes may not swing a national election, approximately half of the eligible American population still participates in presidential elections (Posner, 23). Voters are driven by their desire to express their political preference rather than solely relying on the belief that their vote will decide the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a practical and effective method for electing the President. Its retention ensures certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses attention on swing states, balances the weight of large and small states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While improvements can always be made to any system, it is crucial to consider the experience and wisdom of our founding fathers when evaluating any potential changes to the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of retaining the Electoral College for the future of our democratic nation.

Sincerely,

"" Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Think that people fail on and on that he mighty think that some people can do it when they need to do.

llama_70b_v11002,"The legalization of marijuana has been a topic of debate for quite some time now. While some argue that it should be legalized, others believe it should remain illegal. In my opinion, I believe that marijuana should be legalized.

Firstly, it is important to note that marijuana has several medical benefits. It can be used to treat chronic pain, anxiety, and even cancer. By legalizing marijuana, patients who suffer from these conditions would have access to a safer and more effective treatment option. Additionally, legalizing marijuana would also reduce the number of people who are imprisoned for possession of the drug. This would not only save taxpayers money, but it would also help to reduce the number of people who are unfairly punished for using a drug that is safer than alcohol.

Furthermore, legalizing marijuana would also help to reduce drug-related crime. Currently, the illegal drug trade is a major source of revenue for criminal organizations. By legalizing marijuana, the government would be able to regulate and tax the sale of the drug, taking away a significant source of income for these organizations. Additionally, law enforcement resources could be directed towards more serious crimes, such as violent crime, rather than being wasted on drug-related offenses.

Another argument in favor of legalizing marijuana is that it is a safer drug than many other substances that are currently legal. For example, alcohol is a legal drug that is responsible for thousands of deaths each year. In contrast, there has never been a recorded death due to marijuana use alone. Additionally, tobacco use is also legal and is responsible for numerous deaths each year. By legalizing marijuana, people would have a safer alternative to these drugs.

However, there are also arguments against the legalization of marijuana. One of the main concerns is that it would increase drug use and abuse. While it is true that legalizing marijuana may lead to an increase in use, it is also important to note that drug use is a public health issue rather than a criminal issue. By legalizing marijuana, the government would be able to provide education and treatment programs to help individuals who struggle with drug addiction.

In conclusion, the legalization of marijuana is a topic that has both pros and cons. However, in my opinion, the benefits of legalizing marijuana outweigh the drawbacks. By legalizing marijuana, patients would have access to a safer and more effective treatment option, drug-related crime would be reduced, and people would have a safer alternative to other drugs. While there are concerns about increased drug use and abuse, these can be addressed through education and treatment programs. Ultimately, the legalization of marijuana would be a positive step towards a safer and healthier society.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The legalization of marijuana has been a controversial topic in recent years.

E117A2236FB2,"Dear Principle,

I hear that you are planing on changing the schools cell phone policy. I applaud you for that. I completely agree with you that our school has been having trouble with the whole cell phone thing.

I have been thinking about your two possibilities and thought I would assist you with the truthful thought of a student. Although policy two assures that no student will be tempted to text during class, I believe that policy one is the right way to go because of the fact that kids forget things and need to set reminders like you can do on a phone, also you can text your family if you forgot something and need them to bring it to you. These are some of the reasons why i believe that policy one is the better way to go.

First off, students should be allowed to have their phones at school because now a days cell phones are becoming the only way for kids to be in touch with family and friends. If students need to get a hold of their direct family they need to have their phones. If you were to go with policy two students would have no way of doing that. Trust me when i say that students should be allowed to have their phones during school hours incase of an emergency.

Then there is the fact that if student have them during lunch and other free times they will be more likely to follow the rules of turning them off during class so they don't get in trouble and wont have the privilege of being able to use them taken away as well. I know that if you were to change the policy to number two I would follow those rules very carefully. Students would enjoy following the rule if that meant that we could use them during lunch and other free times.

Lastly there is the reason of how students would be more on task. They would have already talked to their friends during free times that they would have nothing more to say and would be able to focus more on the school work. If we are more focused then we are less likely to annoy the teachers with our chatty-ness and we would be able to get further on in the curriculum then we do now.

This would be better the school and for the students.

All in all, student should be allowed to have our phones with us at school. We would be able to talk to family and friends when we needed to during free times, we would follow the rules more so that we wouldn't lose our privilege of using the phones during school hours, lastly we would not be as talkative and would be able to focus more because we would have already gotten to say what was needed to be said. So please consider what I have provided in my letter to you about why i believe policy two is the better way to go. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

7DC02C918305,"It is often said that attitude is everything, and this is especially true when it comes to success in life. Positive thinking has been proven time and time again to be a key component of achieving both short-term and long-term successes, from more mundane everyday accomplishments to reaching our biggest dreams. Positive thinking is the practice of choosing to focus on the good rather than the bad in any situation and thereby engage with life more positively and productively.

When we choose to focus on the good in a situation, our stress and anxiety levels tend to decrease. This can have a profound impact on our mental health and the ability to cope with challenging situations. Positive thinking can help us look at problems from a different perspective and push us to pursue solutions. This can also increase our emotional intelligence, which in turn can lead to better communication and relationships with those around us.

Furthermore, positive thinking can bolster our self-confidence and encourage us to pursue opportunities for growth and advancement. Knowing that we can take on challenges, that we can push our limits and still come out on top, is a powerfuliumph of positivityhedge courage in our own capabilities and can be hugely motivational. Striving for success is so much easier when we‚Äôre not constantly putting ourselves down and expecting failure.

Ultimately, choosing to maintain a positive attitude is one of the most important steps we can take towards a successful life. To embrace the positivity potential within ourselves and our experiences is to open ourselves up to the possibility of a life full of growth and accomplishment.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Create an essay about how positive thinking leads to success in life.,2
90CE0667EFD9,"Dear Florida Senator,

The ongoing debate of whether or not the Electoral College process is fair or unjust is always around you, I presume. I would like to give some personal feedback in the matters of this situation.

I understand that the Electoral College was created in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. (Source 1) However it is not a fair or even equal compromise. The people hardly have any political voice in this aspect. The electors that in return vote for the people generally aren't chosen by the people, the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. (Some state laws vary) (Source 1) If you faithfully are going to vote for the Presidential candidate of your choice, you should be able to have faith in your vote. Those in favor of the Electoral College could make the remark that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...""(Source 3) In the world of reality people don't just want make a comment and expect no reaction, people want to be heard. This is similar to voting, people want their vote to count toward the candidate of their choice not the electors for the candidate.

This then runs into the problem of unfaithful electors. Their votes are never for sure. Although they claim to have ""trust that is rarely betrayed"" (Source 3) you can never be a hundred percent sure in the electors. ""Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Source 2) If this happens the popular vote actually wouldn't go to the thought candidate.

""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" (Source 2) In a case of a tie the vote would go to the House of Representatives. This means that each state would only be able to cast one vote. This is not a smart backup plan. It is not fair for states of different population sizes to have one vote- basically being categorized as one. Proportionally it is not right for a state who represents 500,000 such as Wyoming to recieve the same number of equally weighted votes as a state who represents 35 million such as California. (Source 2)

The Electoral College also follows the ""Winner-take-all"" method. This means that most in most elections the focus is on the swing states or toss up states, all the efforts go to these states. Even though ""the voters are most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"", as said by those who believe in the Electoral College (Source 3) what about the voters who have been faithful all along? How can you expect them to feel when they barely get noticed? Those are the ones the candidates should be thanking and having gratitute toward because they are the ones who will be supporting them and their campaign.

I know that politics are filled with misconceptions and many confusing roles and aspects but please consider my thoughts and words. I speak for the voiceless and my fellow neighbors, but most importantly I speak for what our government was founded upon, WE THE PEOPLE.

llama_70b_v1969,"As a grade 10 student, I believe that limiting car usage is essential for the well-being of our community and the environment. The passage set provides valuable information and ideas that support this notion.

Firstly, reducing car usage can significantly decrease air pollution. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is a major environmental risk to health, causing an estimated 7 million premature deaths each year. The passage from the Union of Concerned Scientists states that transportation is responsible for 27% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, with cars being the largest contributor. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of harmful emissions released into the atmosphere, improving air quality and public health.

Secondly, limiting car usage can also help alleviate traffic congestion. The passage from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute states that traffic congestion costs the US economy $124 billion annually in wasted time and fuel. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce traffic congestion, saving time and money for commuters. Additionally, the passage from the American Public Transportation Association highlights the benefits of public transportation, including reduced traffic congestion, lower emissions, and increased mobility for those who cannot drive.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote physical activity and health. The passage from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that physical inactivity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, we can encourage physical activity and improve public health.

Lastly, limiting car usage can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. The passage from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that the transportation sector is responsible for 13.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. By transitioning to cleaner modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles, we can reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is essential for improving air quality, alleviating traffic congestion, promoting physical activity, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The passage set provides compelling evidence for the benefits of reducing car usage, and as a grade 10 student, I believe it is our responsibility to take action and promote sustainable transportation options for a healthier, more sustainable future.

Now, chew on that! I mean if you think about all the gas stations, and all the space that automobiles take up, it really wouldn't be a bad idea in banning cars in like city and small towns. If you were to drive 20 miles in 8 minutes, How fast do you think you would get to that destination if you were to walk that 20 miles. Some situations just isn't fair, Like motorists with evennumbered license plates would have to leave their car at their home, or suffer a 31 fine. One of the most populated city in the world has gone down to 60% of their population in about five days of intensifying smog. If you were to get rid of all these cars, Who would be getting up every morning just to go to school or even their jobs?

I've thought about lot of things in my life, But never across the fact of get rid of cars. The advantages of limiting automobiles are high, just for the fact of smog problems, or even damaging the air that we breath. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicle in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.Duffer,16 Pow!

You just ran into a car trying to park the long bed V8 44 Nissian Titan at gatorbait in Melrose FL. All that money that you payed to get the stupid truck, and now you dented the front bumper. That will be 12,000 for the truck, with another 2,000 to fix the front bumper. How can save money, but also get rid of all this crammed space. I will have to say that we need to get rid of all these cars and just leave them at the house.

I don't know what will happen to automobile shops, but it isn't about the lousy shops! It's about our freedom to do what we please, and if that means that automobiles are in the way, remove them. We, the people, need to make more compact, accessible places where it will be with less space to park. I have an idea, let's forbidden street parking, Driveways, home garages, and generally anything that can be used to park or put a car in. Until that happens it is just a dream, that hundreds would love to become reality. Fellow citizens should also make only 2 places avaliable to park, and that would be parking garages or you have to pay 40 and buy a house if you break a rule to drive your car to a place.

It just dosen't make sense to keep something that is causing us so much greaf. Did you know that passanger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe,While up to 50% in the U.S is car intensive areas. Life as we know still goes on like nothing has every really bothered us like the Automobiles do. ""Our Development since World War 2 has been centered around the car, now that has go to change."" Said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. They are promoting new communities that would be less dependent on cars. I believe that we finish this car problems, We can focus on more important things such as life, family, and Money.

As I write, People are out in the real world making cars for humans like me and you. If we can't put a stop to having all these new vehicles, than it truly will say something about us and who we are as a community. Yes, I agree with having vehicles to drive from point A to B, But that dosen't mean that I don't want change that will help us with money issues. Automobiles are a waste of space, and can hurt by putting all this money that we're just throwing away like we are the richest country in the World. But, we are not.",0,train_essays,,5

This can even allow teacher not to have so much work to grade and they themselves can go on vacations also. Students shouldn't be required to complete summer projects, because it's a time for students to spend time with their families, have experience in job or volunteer for clubs, and have time for themselves.

During summer breaks student get to spend with parents go on vacations, visit families in other countries and take care of their siblings. They get to have fun with their families for example, go in a 5k run, go to the museum, which can let them get closer to their famllies.

Students get to have job experience or volunteer for other clubs. They can even have interest in something which is a great opportunity for them to know their future career and it's very important for every student. They also get to know work ethics before they get in there future career. For example they can babysit which can give them the experience about babies if they like them or not. They also get the opportunity to get a job and save up for college, which can help them become responsible.

Summer it's a time for students to have time for themselves. Students do not really get time for them and it's becoming a difficult thing for them, because to all the school works and school stress. They get to have their own time, like hanging out with their friends, going cool and relaxing places or going for therapy.

In this letter I would like to explame the importants of Electoral College. This'll explain what it is,its defenses to the attacks on getting rid of it,and finally why it was created in the first place.

The Electoral College was a process created by the four fathers in the Constitution to established the election of the ""President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""-

Source 1: What Is the Electrol College,paragraph 1.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Majority electorcal votes for President is 270. ""Congressional delegtion: On for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.""-

Paragrah 2,What Is the Electoral College.

Yes this involves in the 23rd Amendment of the Contitution that Washington D.C or District or Columbia is allocated 3 electors and is treated like a state in the Electoral College. The electors for a candidate running for President has a group of electors generally by his/her's political party.

Many believe there is something wrong with the Eledtoral College. Even some like ""Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, And the AFL-CIO""-

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong.

They all have in common is that they want to abolish the Electoral College. However the party will get to ""select a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.""-

Source 3 paragraph 2.

However rarely do you actually see it's possible for the winner to get eletoral vote but not popular vote. in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes then Bush. But the agurement falls apart since it happens rarely. It was the frist time since 1888 that's about 112 years that this has happened. It's even highly unlikely it will end in a tie-as 538 is an even number it is divied to the states.

It was started by the founding fathers in order to have a informed government. It is rumored that they believed that the common person the person who votes for popularity is to uninformed to choose who will be President. So in the Constitution they put it as a ""pompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress by popular vote of qulified citizens.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
A620127943B6,"I strongly disagree because some students don't want to participate in extracurricular activities. Most of the student body have things to do afterschool and they can't attend both at the same time. Our principles shouldn't make somone do something if they don't want to.¬†If the parents don't want their kid staying for extacurricular activites then they shouldn't because what if the parents have something to do with their kids afterschool or they have a doctors appointement.

Majority of the student body at our school doesn't know how to play sports. The coaches at our school put people on the team that doesn't know how to play. What's the purpose of having a team with people that don't know what is going on during the games. If the students dont want to play something the shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do. Sport require effort to put yourself on the field and not mess up in front of the coach so that you would be able to make the team and not be embarrassed to not see your name ont the paper while eveyone that made it is celebrating.

In my opinion the student council is not something we should have at our school. A lot of the student body gets upset because the president promises something and it never happenes and then it turns in a big rivarly between everyone. We learn abut politics in our geography and i think the us as the student body shouldn't be worried about politics as much because then the student body will think that it is ok to do what the politics do and say.

In conclusion i stated that i strongly disagree because not everyone has the ability to do certain things that others can. I feel that if the students don't want to do extracurricular activites then they shouldn't be made to because they don't want to go out there looking ike a fool or run for president and not make it because they didnt have enough votes.

falcon_180b_v1_843,"As a high school student, I have grown up around video games and have played my fair share of them. However, I do not believe that video games can directly contribute to violent behavior. While violent video games may desensitize individuals to violence, it is ultimately up to the individual's actions and decisions whether to act upon violent impulses.

One argument against the idea that video games can lead to violent behavior is that there are many other factors that play into an individual's behavior, such as their upbringing, environment, and personal experiences. Blaming video games for violent acts overlooks these other crucial factors.

Another reason to support my position is the lack of concrete evidence that shows a direct correlation between video games and violent behavior. Many studies have been conducted on this topic, yet the results have been inconclusive. It is unfair to assume that video games are the sole cause of violent acts when there is no concrete evidence to prove it.

Moreover, many non-violent video games can have positive benefits such as improved problem-solving skills, creativity, and hand-eye coordination. Video games can also act as a form of stress relief or a way to escape from reality for some individuals.

In conclusion, blaming video games for violence overlooks crucial factors such as an individual's upbringing, environment, and personal experiences that contribute to their behavior. While violent video games may desensitize individuals to violence, it is ultimately up to the individual's actions and decisions whether to act upon violent impulses.

Hey there!  So, you know how sometimes you're like, ""Ugh, I wish I could just focus on my homework without distractions?""  Yeah, me too! That's why I think setting up after school homework clubs in schools is a great idea! 

First of all, it's like, super helpful for people who have a lot of homework.  Like, I know I do! Sometimes I'm like, ""How am I gonna finish all of this?"" But if I had a homework club, I could just go there and focus on my work without having to worry about my siblings or TV or anything.  Plus, it's like, a place where I can get help if I need it! 

And it's not just for people who need help, either!  It's also a great way for people who are like, super smart and stuff  to help others out!  Like, you could be like a tutor or something!  And it's like, good for your resume too! 

But like, the best part is that it's like, a place to hang out with friends!  You know how sometimes you're like, ""Ugh, I'm so bored...""  But if you had a homework club, you could be like, ""Hey, wanna come to homework club?""  And then you could hang out with your friends while you're doing your homework!

911DD337DD61,"In my opinion, students should take electives instead of music, drama, or arts. Some students may dislike to be in music or drama because they don't have experience to be singing or drawing. They should focus on what they are good at for themselves.

One reason that students should take electives, they will pay attention to their classes and finish up their work to get the credit. Some students can't multi-task if they do drama class and math at the same time. They would have to focus on the important things that they're good at. Students shouldn't be wasting time on taking drama or music classes because they may not be interested in doing those classes. It'll be easier for the students to learn more with their assignments, instead of worrying about arts or dram classes.

For example, during in my junior year, the school wanted me to take art and music. I never wanted to take art because I knew I would be awful at drawing and fail the class. I had to take music also, I was horrible playing the guitar and I was failing in that class. I've told the teacher that I couldnt take art nor music because I wasn't great at it. I just wanted to focus on my course classes, so that I can graduate and get pass all my classes to graduate my year.

Second reason that students shouldnt take it, they will finish with their course classes and will get to graduate their year. It's hard when some students can't do what others can do at drama or musics. It'll be the best opportunity for the students to focus and work hard on their course classes. They should not worry about the electives because that can be done at the end of the year. They won't have to stress about their grades to be below F if they don't take the electives. They wouldn't stress about taking electives and course classes at the same time because it'll stress them out.

Last reason, students shouldn't take advantage of making themselves work more as they are now. They should only worry about their course classes because those are the only classes that will make them graduate. Some students have no talent or experienced to do art or to be in musics classes. It's better for them to finish their course classes and then at the end, they can take their electives.

Therefore, these are the reasons why students shouldn't be required to take classes in arts, musics, or drama.",0,original_moth,"Task: Write an essay about why students should not be required to take classes in arts, music, or drama.",3
4214dad7,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals and communities. This is a growing trend in many parts of the world, including Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can improve the environment, promote alternative transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and create healthier and more sustainable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading cause of climate change. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting alternative transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards a cleaner and healthier environment.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also help reduce air pollution. The article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer highlights the impact of car-free days in Paris. After days of intense smog, the city enforced a partial driving ban, which resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a decrease in air pollution. This shows that by limiting car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier living conditions for residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. As mentioned in the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day, leading to streets devoid of traffic jams. By promoting alternative transportation and reducing the number of cars on the road, we can alleviate congestion and create more efficient and accessible transportation systems.

Limiting car usage also has social and economic benefits. In the article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it is mentioned that car ownership rates have been decreasing in the United States. This shift in behavior can have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as well as reduce the dependence on the car industry. Additionally, by promoting alternative transportation methods, such as biking and walking, we can create more vibrant and economically flourishing communities. The article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" provides an example of Vauban, Germany, where residents have given up their cars and have a more enjoyable and stress-free lifestyle.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can improve the environment, promote alternative transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and create healthier and more sustainable communities. The examples from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States show that this trend is gaining popularity and can have a positive impact on both individuals and society as a whole. It is important for us to consider these advantages and work towards reducing car usage for a better and greener future.",1,radek_500,,2

This is one of your students at your school. I have written this letter to inform you that you do not have to cancel all school sports. I think that you don't need to cancel it for all student. I think that you should have the audacity to tell everyone that the sports will not be able to be played by students that have anything below an A-C average. All student with an A, B, or a C average can play any sport they wanted to but every marking period they should have to show the coach's their progress report. All students should be able to show their progress reports to you, a teacher, or the coach. An other reason not to cancel the sports are so that all the students can stay in shape and not have any troubles with their weight. All the students should be able to participate in any after school program sport. All the students are able to play with each other.

EX: boys play with girls or girls play with boys.

All students should have a sport to keep them active for a while and not get distracted by any thing like walking around the class. All students should be active so they do not have to disturb the class with their need to let energy out of their system. ALL STUDENTS MAY PARTICIPATE IN VOLLEYBALL, BASEBALL, FOOTBALL, TENNIS, SOCCER, BAT MITTEN, BASKETBALL, TRACK, HOCKEY, ICE SKATING, ROLLER BLADING RACES, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES.

ANY STUDENT WHO WANTS TO PARTICIPATE SHOULD SIGN A PERMISSION SLIP AND SHOW THEIR REPORT CARDS. Students should not be all closed up with nothing to do they should at least have an hour of fun in their school day at least twice a week there should be 2-3 hours of out side time to let their energy all out of their systems.

be0547ba,"Dear State Senator, Im going to tell you why im in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I will give you a few reasons why we should keep the Electoral College and don't worry I will also tell you some stuff, that's not really good to keeping it.

Lets start off with the first reason why we should keep the Electoral College. The first reason is the big states. I probably have confused you but let me explain to you what I mean. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. For example, in 2012 the popular vote was really close in Florida nevertheless Obama, who won that vote. In other words, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The second reason why is, avoiding runoff elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast which would highly complicate the presidential election, which is reduced by the Electoral College. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state for example, Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

Next reason is swing states. The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidate, as we saw in 2012's election. The voter who are in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, really listening to the competing candidates. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Now im going to tell you something bad about keeping the Electoral College. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Let me ask you a few questions, who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding for public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? Well, sometimes state conventions, or state party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves. Did you know the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

I'll admit that the Electoral College is a bit unfair and irrational...but there is also some really good reasons to keep it. No matter how hard it is to decide, I have stated my reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. To me I believe that Bob Dole was wrong when he said, ""Abolish the Electoral College!"" We should not abolish the Electoral College but instead, keep it and maybe make it better.",0,train_essays,,6
88E07277AA58,"It is suitable to argue for the development of driverless cars because they could easily be the newest innovation to improve the future of automobiles. Not only would they be more fuel efficient to aid economic aspects and contribute to conservation and improvement of the environment, but they would also greatly improve upon current systems of public transportaion.

Ideally, the Google Cofounder, Sergey Brin, could create the automoblie that he envisions. This would mean that the cars ""would use half the fuel of today's taxis"" (Passage 1).

Shortening the usage of fuel contibutes towards economic benefits because it would require less spending for the gas. As well as this, the decline in usage of fuel would benefit the environment both by using less natural resources from oil reserves, but also by emitting less harmful gases into the atmosphere which are currently destroying the ozone layer and causing issues such as global warming.

Improving upon current methods of public transportation, Sergey claims that he envisions these fuel efficient, driverless cars forming a ""public-transport taxi system"" and offering 'far more flexibility than a bus"" (Passage 1). This would be an improvement because buses currently have limited range of motion and also move slower and use much more fuel than these new cars would. Also, public transportation would become a more attainable luxury for working class citizens who may usually rely on buses. With driverless taxi-like poublic transportation, a more suitable and enjoyable commute could be possible for those who can only pay a small amount for the service.

Although some may be concerned about the safety of driverless cars, the Google car has been opperating on the roads for 7 years without any accidents or crashes (Passage 2). It seems this would be even better statistics without crashing than most actual drivers today. This technology could be designed to be alert and tentative, reacting to every mishap, something that even some actual drivers today have trouble with due to distractions.

Driverless cars would greatyly improve the lives of people wanting to commute and use public transportation and aid the environment and economy with its benefits. ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
falcon_180b_v1_853,"I believe that students should have the right to evaluate their teachers. This is because teachers play an important role in shaping the future of students, and it is essential for them to receive feedback from the students they teach. By evaluating teachers, students can provide valuable insights into how well the teacher is doing and what areas they need to improve on.

One reason why students should evaluate their teachers is that it helps to improve the quality of education. When students are given the opportunity to provide feedback on their teachers, they can highlight areas where the teacher is doing well and areas where they need to improve. This information can then be used to create personalized development plans for teachers, which can help them to improve their teaching skills and provide better quality education to their students.

Another reason why students should evaluate their teachers is that it helps to build a better relationship between students and teachers. When students are asked to provide feedback on their teachers, it shows that their opinions are valued and that they are an important part of the learning process. This can help to build trust between students and teachers, which can lead to a more positive and productive learning environment.

However, some people argue against student evaluations of teachers because they believe that students may not be objective in their feedback. They argue that students may give negative feedback to teachers who they do not like or who have given them a low grade. This is a valid concern, but it can be addressed by ensuring that the evaluation process is fair and unbiased.

In conclusion, I believe that students should have the right to evaluate their teachers. This is because it helps to improve the quality of education, build a better relationship between students and teachers, and provide valuable feedback to teachers. While there are concerns about the objectivity of student evaluations, these can be addressed through a fair and unbiased evaluation process. Ultimately, the benefits of student evaluations of teachers outweigh the risks, and I believe that they should be an important part of the education system.### Instruction:

I would all the students that love doing sports to join the protest or the boycott with me and see what we can get out of it but sometimes it probably because of the money like the schools don't have enough money and they need more money because there a lot of kids going out for sports and they have Fs and but they still have the money to join the sport in there on the sports team for the whole season and they have all Fs and your coach don't know about it they are a really good player what would the coach do that's how I look at things but there not good and not going to practice they wasted there parents money then your parents would get really mad at you and sign you up for any sports anymore.

But if your really good and you make good grades you belong on the team but you can't make the practices that's showing the coach you don't want to get better and that's really bad and if you just show up for the meets or games your not going to face because you cant go to practice that's on you and your about to get kick off the team your giving up and your saying that you quite because of the coaches.

1fc7961e,"Dear Senator, The Presidential election is one of America's proudest accomplishments. It sets the United States apart from other countries and brings great pride to the people. As the United States grows older and wiser, it learns more than what the original Founding Fathers knew. One of their the Founding Fathers great contributions to this country is the electoral Congress. This process is still being used today. Based on the positive and negative aspects this system, the electoral Congress should remain the way Americans elect government leaders.

The major goal of elections is to choose a leader in a mythotical and smooth way. The electoral Congress brings a ""landslide electoralvote victory in that state."" source 3, paragraph 18 This gives the public a reasurrence that their state was strong and sure about the decision. This comfort might not come if the elections were popularvote based only. Also, ""the electoral College requires a presidential to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president"" source 3, paragraph 19 It's important to have a system that doesn't allow one region to dominate over the others. Had this been the case, the balance among the people would be completely thrown off.

Of course, there are drawbacks to this system. There are a good number of people who believe this is not a democratic way of having their voices be heard. source 3, paragraph 15 Along with that, close calls such as ties have shown to strain the current voting system. source 2, paragraph 11 However, these are rare cases and when they presented themselves, the leaders of the country were able to fix the issue in a way that appeased most. This current process does give some states power to tip the scales while others are locked in on their canadates before the voting begins. source 2 paragraph 13 But the results over the past years have shown no party has an unfair advantage over the others. America has had both many democrats and republicans in office.

Based off of the current solutions to the electoral Congress, for the timebeing, remaining the same would be in the best interest of the nation. It is acknowleged that the people are voting for a slate of electors and not the actual canadate. But the voters who know United States elections are about ""expressing their political prefernces"" source 3, paragraph 23 are accomidated nicely and reassured of the current process.

FE1DEACABE37,"A machine identify human emotions doesn't seem to be valuable. The Facial Coding System is not nessesary for students in a classroom. Therefore, it just does not seem to benitficial to the students.

"" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" meaning everybody has there own way of expressing each others emotions. One can say that they are and another can say that they are sad. There's really no for need for a system to tell your expression at that time. You can obviously tell there expression. Plain and simple.

A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused of bored. Instead of the computer idenfitying the students emotions why doesn't a teacher actually go up the student to ask if everthing is fine and ask if he needs help on anything. Rather than a computer doing all the work. Not everybody is going to feel the same, but atleast it's worth a shot to try.

Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate. We already have enough of technology to do those kind of obsticales. That is a everyday thing for us humans. Why develop more technology that doesn't seem to be useful for your emotional expression.

I would like to have you pick policy number 1. If students weren't allowed to use cell phones at school then some of the study clubs might be empty at school because of how many students have to tell there parents there going to study club. Most of the teachers response to that would be ""There's a phone to use in the office"" but most of the time the office phone is always in use and there's always a line of like 5-7 people. Once its your turn to use the phone then your parent might of had said no then you look outside and see that the buses have left already now you have to walk 2-3 miles depending where you live all because of NO cell phones.

In Policy 1 it says specifically that ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times"" in that case most of the students will have no one to text because most there friends are already with them so they can just talk face to face or if they have to advise there parents there going to an after school activity. When your in class maybe the teacher would probably be able to collect all the phones and get them after class.

I think that having cell phones at school will increase the amount of people going to after school activity's which would the school a better way of the district noticing the participation of the students making the school a better look on becoming best school.

420D3018845E,"I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school because it is an excellent way to find interests in leisure time, improve people's social and health lives, and it has an important role in serving the community and academic success.

First of all, many students, especially teenagers, spend a vast amount of time on social medias and cellular devices. It may lead to negative consequences such as lack of self-control and self-management, imperfect grades, and even cyberbullying. Before students become mature enough to handle their own situations, adults should be the supervisors and help them get on the right track. Sometimes it is acceptable to force people to on a certain task for their own benefits. Therefore, extracurricular activities is a great option when it comes to after school life. Students may seek their true interests through these experiences and even more, find the purpose of their lives. For instance, a student who participates in a the student council may find a big interest in politics or management; another student who works on the yearbook might seek a great favor in arts and photography. Moreover, there is a possibility that some people can target what they want to major in for the future.

Additionally, extracurricular activities may contribute to students' health and social lives by creating opportunities such as teamwork and group projects. Besides focusing on school grades, students should also pay attention on developing relationships and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, all of these are going to be helpful for having great experiences in the society. Many students crave for a sense of belonging and they often find unexpected gains in extracurricular activities such as friendship or a healthy life style. For example, playing sports can exercise your body and strengthen your muscles, when people get older, it can even prevent typical diseases for a longer life span. Also, sport teams often develop communication and teamwork skills, through these activities, students are able to make new friends by talking about topics that they are interested in, and these relationships can also be a source of strength when people come into challenges and difficulties in life. It is a positive way for students to be physically and mentally prepared for the future.

Furthermore, extracurricular activities is a nice way to contribute to the school and it can even be beneficial to academic success. School provides an educational environment for students and students can participate in activities such as school board or the announcements and news program to serve back to the school. In a way, it has the same meaning and purpose as community service, it advocates for serving others and offers many experience that are helpful to the society. On the other hand, participating in extracurricular activities may serve as a great advantage in high school¬†or college applications, every school looks forward to accepting students who are willing to spend effort on things that they are interested in, and at the same time know the importance of serving back to the community.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities have many benefits for students' academic and after school lives such as finding one's personal interests, adding more values to one's social and health life, and lastly, serving the community while being grateful for nice things in the world. With all these advantages, I think it would be a beneficial decision to suggest students to engage in extracurricular activities.",0,persuade_corpus,,7

If the car is unable to control it's self anymore and the driver is not fit to drive a lot of problems are going to occur. Also if the car has a malfunction and an accident occurs who recieves the blame the driver or the manufacture? Self driving cars are just a problem waiting to happen. People around the world would feel safer with the manual cars they're used to than cars that aren't very well known and have the possibilty to malfunction at any given time. Technology should be more focused on creating cures for diseases and doing things to help the the people in the world, rather than assisting the fat and lazy in getting around without doing any work at all. Also these cars will cost much more to manufacture and sell at higher prices than manual cars, so what regular person would buy a very expensive car just because it can drive itself, something these people already know how to do and can do for less money?

Self driving cars shouldn't be street legal for many obvious reasons. They're more of a problem than they're worth, and need to be tested more before they're certified for the roads. For now there are just too many underlying problems for these cars to work. We should just stick to what we know, manualy driven cars. As the future comes maybe these cars will become a possibilty, but for now they need to keep testing these cars and sorting out the kinks before they allow people to drive them on the streets.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
4E078101C9DD,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning. Should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? I believe these summer projects should be student-designed¬†and not teachers. How would the students enjoy their summer and knowing that they got projects that is due before school starts again. If we call it summer break then the students shouldn't get any summer projects thats gonna ruin the break for them. Let them enjoy their summer break. I understand where they teachers are coming from and trying to assign the students these summer projects and making sure they are ready for their upcoming classes.

I choose for it to be student-designed, because the students already have 10 months of school that they do projects and assignments that stresses them out already. If a student wants to continue¬†learning during summer then he can do summer school or online classes that'll help him continue his learning and staying on task. Students shouldn't get summer projects assigned to them during their break. For; example, how would they enjoy their summer break with their families, if they stressing about finishing¬†the summer projects instead of relaxing their minds and spending time with family.

Summer projects are beneficial for students. At the same time it all depends on what classes you are taking next year. If you want to challenge yourself and take hard classes then be prepared to get summer projects to get you ready for your classes. School work and projects already causes enough stress for the students in general during school year, but getting summer projects doubles it up. Summer projects will take the fun away from summer and it wont be the same for the students. Students won't have as much time as they want to do what they want in summer, they would be stressing about something that they shouldn't be. They wouldn't get the point of what summer break is actually for.

I do understand why teachers believe that summer projects would help students continue learning. Summer projects does help students stay on task and busy and prepare them for their upcoming classes. Summer projects are beneficial but students don't understand that. The students been in school for so long that at this point they just want summer break to come. Summer is time where the students can relax their minds and be stress free for little. You also gotta understand that some students don't have the time for it. For; example, there are students that play summer sports, there are students that work in summer to provide money for them self¬†or help their families out. How would they do that knowing they got summer projects due and stress about not having enough time to do it.

In conclusion

I believe that summer projects should be student-designed and not teachers. It should depend on what the student want for himself not what the teacher wants. If the students wants to to stay on task and continue their learning in summer break then they can sign up for online classes or ask for summer projects to do. Not all students have the time to do summer projects. Students won't have any free time to enjoy their summer or family vacation. Let the students enjoy their summer break without a stress and relax their minds.¬†¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,4
B2123357B114,"Living a successful life requires more than talent, luck, or hard work. One of the most essential tools for success is having a positive attitude. A positive attitude can bear remarkable results, while a negative attitude can act as a major roadblock.

A negative attitude breeds more negativity. It can disrupt our enthusiasm and zest for life, and can lead to unhappiness, unrestrained stress, and difficulty in achieving goals. It is easy to allow negative thoughts to take control and to become consumed by them. However, a positive attitude can help us remain conscious and aware, standing strong even through life‚Äôs hardest struggles.

In contrast, having a positive attitude allows us to discover and nurture our best qualities, as well as enabling us to lead a constructive life. It helps us to focus on solutions, not problems, and gives us the strength to stay resilient in times of stress and difficulty. With a positive attitude, we can embrace opportunities and rise above our failures. We become more resourceful and creative, as well as capable of achieving our goals.

In summary, having a positive attitude is essential to living a successful life. Positive thinking can help us resolve any situation in a flexible and composed manner, allowing us to find joy and happiness in the face of adversity.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Write an essay exploring the idea that having a positive attitude is essential to be successful in life.

I am writing to you to inform you of what i think of community service. Some kid's in our schools think it is boring and waste's time on what they need to do. Others think it should be used for disapline. I agree that we should use it for kids that act up or have detention because they would have to clean for what they did and it wont waste's the teachers time. The reason they should do this is because they wasted their time fooling around in class so now they have to make up that time by doing the service. Another reason why they should do this is because the world is filthy enough that we cant have that no more so what they can do is clean the public park of all its trash .There is a lot of different needs to be done all around the schools and maybe they can do some of that. Their might also be stuff in school to do so they can do that to. If this works maybe the kids in the schools might not act up and pay attention in class.

097BDC9D09D2,"Do you ever get stuck in a problem that you don't know how to fix? Many people get into situations that they cannot solve on their own. A lot of those times they would go to other people asking them for advice. They often go to more than just one person, so they know which solution will work best. After each person that they talk to, they know a little more on what to do. Asking multiple people for advice can help a person by getting more perspectives, and understandings of what to do.

When looking for advice, getting more perspectives is a good idea. If there are more views of the situation, there will be more options when deciding on a solution. People might not agree with one way of doing something, but they might agree with another. Hearing the ideas of others could change the way that the problem is thought about. Each opinion of a person has a different effect on the person in need of advice. Some opinions could be more helpful than others.

If advice is needed, a better understanding of the solutions could help when it's time to make a choice. More knowledge over the problem can be useful when finding a solution. Truly knowing what is wrong will give the person in need of advice more confidence when they are deciding what to do. They will become more open to the possibilities. For example, Generic_Name got into some trouble with her friend, and they are no longer speaking. Generic_Name doesn't know what to do, so she goes to another friend in need of advice. After she went to her friend, she realized that she know a little bit more, but the information that she had was still not enough. She went to three other friends before she understood what the problem was. Then, Generic_Name knew that she just had to talk to her friend and apologize. When the problem is understood, the solution will reveal its self.

Going to more than one person for advice can help them by getting more perspectives and understandings of what to do. If you are in a problem, seek the advice of others. Open up to possibilities, and ask for help. When there are multiple perspectives to a problem, the solution will seem more simple. If advice is needed, a better understanding of what is wrong will help find a resolution. Advice from Multiple people is the better way to solving a problem.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,9
A293591DB50C,"In recent years car ownership has decreased with positive consequences. Life with out cars has its advantages. It is reducing the amount of emissions put into the air, cars are resposible for 12 percent of green house gas. Life without cars can also relive stress.

An experimental car free community in Germany called ""Vauban"" completed in 2006 is a town where 70% of its residents do not own cars and the streets are completely car free. It's constructed so everything is within walking distance. This means no need for cars, wich means little to no polution. People usaully bike or walk to their destination in Vauban.""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much better this way"" says a Vauban resident. Vauban is a component of a movment called smart planning. As you can see, a community with no cars is prospering aurgurably better than one with cars. People are less stressed and pollution is heavily reduced. A life/community with no cars has little to no negative results.

""After a near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air oof the global city."" france need a solution to reduce the smog, so they banned even-numberd license plates on monday and odd on tuesday. with some exceptions such as electric cars and hybrids. After five days of heavy smog and no cars, smog congestion was reduced to 60 percent. Here is another perfect example how decreasing cars on the street is directly linked to pollution decrease .because they took away cars, pollution was heavily decreased. This is a huge advantage that¬† limiting car usage has.

The USA has always been a car culture, but things are changing for the better.

car liscense ownership rates have only decreased since 2005. this means we are putting out less emissions than 12 years ago! we are eqaul to where the country was in 1995. the reasons vary as to why lisence ownsership is decreasing but so far it has its advantages. People are car pooling more and using bikes and walking to their destination. the only negative side of limited car usauge is for the car industry. with less cars on the road, they get less money. But overall people will benifit from this.

Limiting car usage has huge advantages and I encourage you to try walking or biking rather than using your car. You will become more socail, fit, and help prevent pollution.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
E9363204BCEF,"Generic_Name declared all his students must participate in one or more extracurricular activities. It's not a choice for his students to not participate. What the school's students do have a choice over is which activity they want to participate in. People will agree or disagree with his decision, but it will expose students to new views or angles of what they want to do or enjoy. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because it benefits their social, mental and physical health.

Exposing students to exciting and beneficial activities can open up a new passion! Instead of lazing over homework or moping around their house, children can be brighter and happier to get things done. When students are in an environment they enjoy, it can motivate them and brighten up their day. No one likes sitting in a classroom for seven hours. If students have something exciting to look forward to at the end of the day or the day after, it will push them to get their work done to participate in what they want to do.

In addition, extracurriculars give students a reason not to stay home and isolate themselves. A bunch of children just want to go home and binge shows or movies if they'v got nothing to go to. Especially, when they are bored. School can cause stress, so they'll want to wind down by getting sucked into their electronics. Instead, finding something as relaxing as watching a movie, like drawing, making music, reading, etc. is better for their eyes and won't cause eye induced headaches. But, the only way for them to realize that's what they like, is to expose them to it.

Also, if a student were to choose an outdoor activity it would include benefiting their mental health. Fresh air and natural light is good for everyone and wakes people up. Generally, unnatural light causes headaches, tiredness, and is known for making people lose concentration. Being indoors also can cause a trapped or caged feeling because it would be hard to get up and move without disrupting a working environment. Indoor lighting tends to feel dull and drab, not bright and happy.

When students have a closer similarity (their extracurricular activity) it can give them something in common. Having something in common helps people socialize and discuss that topic. Then, children can make friends over things they both like to do and discuss, plus they'll be able to work together on the topic. If the topic they made friends over was a sport, they can become better friends because teammates have to rely on each other¬†during games. Having a sport as an extracurricular activity also gets kids exercising and it's not always a bad thing.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities are good for students. They allow children to maintain their physical health and grow their social circle. Extracurriculars can also benefit their mental health and get kids excited to get done with the day at school. It also gets them out of the house, but still getting to relax or have fun!¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,8
04408EE0F34B,"Should people be texting and driving?

Even though people this they can do it without an accident, people should not be using a phone while driving. Teens, being the main group of people driving distracted, including the fact that the majority of they are newly trained drivers could cause more damage than just a crash. In 2017, over 3000 people were killed due to drivers being distracted. Some things aren't worth the risk and can just be pushed off to another time. While driving and using the device you are putting other drivers, passengers, bystanders and even yourself at risk of getting hurt or much worse.

In any case, while you are texting and driving, you are not thinking about anyone else other than yourself. The main thing going through a person's head while on their phone is what's happening on the screen. You readers may have, or know someone who could be looking at their phone and not hear a word someone says. It's already disrespectful to be on your phone while talking to somebody, so imagine how crazy it is to be on it while operating dangerous vehicle at high speeds. Texting and driving is more of an impulse, the driver is more worried about getting caught than hurt ,but the punishment of death and homicide is worse than texting and driving.

Without a doubt, you may think that the person you are texting or the game that you are playing can be done at another time. The game can wait till you are out of the car, but if you need to communicate with someone, there are many alternatives than doing it while driving. You have option to call someone and put your phone on spreaker so it will be out of your way, pulling over into a parking lot is also a choice and finally texting at a red light or stop sign only if its legal in your state. Like the famous quote from Star Trek, The

Wrath of Khan, ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" meaning that you have to put the majority over yourself even if you think you shouldn't.

Although, you may not want to die, there are still more simple reasons you should avoid using your phone while driving. If you get caught you will have to pay an expensive fine and your car insurance will go up. Paying hundreds of dollars is not worth one text, one youtube video of anything else you could be doing on it. Most of the people who text and drive probably is doing it because they will be busy later, but going to court for a ticket will just add more to your schedule.

As a result, you as a reader can see all the risks and should yourself

""is this really worth it""? In a situation like this, the cons outweigh the pros and that's not good. If you want others to care about you then you have to respect yourself first to show them what it looks like. Think about the family of the kid you ran over all to heart some instagram post, it's not worth it. If you truly want to be a responsible driver, then obey the laws and don't use your phone while driving.

E84CD172D3EA,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author makes a point about this facial Action Coding System (FACS) and how it is useful in the classroom. In this essay, I will explain how this new software is useful. And how useful it would be in the classroom.

One example of this technology being used in a classroom is, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

This gives a real life example on how it could be used in a classroom.

The author explains that we already use this in the classroom everyday. This example is, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried, etc."" This tells us that we use this everyday and we dont even know we use it. So we already use it in the classroom.

Another fine example is, ""The facial expressions for each smotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" This tells us that there are too many emotions to count and that it would be useful to teachers to be able to tell what the students are feeling.

Throughout this essay, I have described how the author tells us that using this technology would be useful. I fully belive that this would make the world a better place. We would be able to use it so we wouldn't hurt anyones feelings.                   ",0,persuade_corpus,,9

Everyone had asked for advice in there life it's common this do in daily life,but sometimes we are uncertain of the answer we get after we ask for advice. Sometimes more than one person may help with a certain problem you have or may soon have. But is talking to an extra source helpful yes, yes it is. Here ill prove it to you.

When your shopping you always wonder ''Am I getting the best price?''If not your crazy. If you do than this is one of the time multiple opinions that may help. Here is a example. your shopping for a car and the price that the dealer ship is supisously to high you would probably look for people who have that car and ask for an opinion on how much should I buy it for so you know your not being scammed out of your money or maybe you can find out a way to get a much better car at a far better price. The possibility are endless when it come to buying things. This here is another example. I have an interest in LEGOs but I always have trouble¬†when shopping for them and its always the same problem. The price,LEGOs,they a very fun yet expensive toy,A medium sized set could be over $50! As a kid that would be all of my saving but i've found a way to get them for a far better deal than I could ever hope and I do this by asking several people during the time my neighborhood has garage sales to see if there is any way I could get my hand on some LEGOs¬†at a great bargain that and you always have EBay.

Imagine your in school but the day before you where really sick and couldnt remember if you had a test or your homework due that that day well never fear communication is here and with it you can check all of your best sources like your friend Generic_Name or Generic_Name they are both sources you can rely on because there are your friend and they would never lead you astray,right? All jokes aside this could be super yes I said super and i'm not five but this is super helpful lets throw in another example. Your walking home when you get a text from a friend they say that spring break will now be two weeks long and your unsure but when you ask another friend and they say its two weeks long and so your convinced,but what you didnt know as well¬†as your friends is that the school announcements were off and that there was just one week of spring break and so you now have been gone from school thinking that school was out but in reality you have just missed a whole¬†week of school. The sad part of this story is it¬†could have all been avoided if you just confirmed with a few more sources. This does not only apply to school though. They just the easiest of the examples.

Now I know there will be at least¬†one person who will have no one to talk to even about this. Never fear thats why the internet is here! Seriously these day you have all of the knowledge and¬†opinions in the world at your finger tips but not only that but hundreds of sources that will indeed confirm any question or help you with an problem or get you any advice you need. this is not the only way other than human way to ask questions and be able to confirm you answers with it books not thousands but millions of books to chose form some are for stories but many are for information,information that can be confirmed with even crossing over the internet and humans to get the best advice or information ever!

Now you know all of the many ways and reasons to get multiple responses for many things need for everyday life. So now you know that with multiple opinions and facts you can make the best choices on nearly everything except gamboling you should never get hooked on gamboling because it bad so make sure you get multiple opinions and dont gamble because its bad!",0,persuade_corpus,,7
llama_70b_v1109,"Introduction:
Hey there, I know you think the Face on Mars is like, totally made by aliens and stuff, but let me tell you, it's not. I mean, I know it looks like a face and all, but it's just a natural landform. I'm gonna tell you why.

Body:
First of all, the Face is made of natural materials. It's not like someone came along and built it out of concrete or something. It's made of rock and soil, just like the rest of the planet. And that's not all, the article says that the Face is formed by natural geological processes, like erosion and weathering. That means it's been shaped by wind and water over time, just like how the Grand Canyon was formed.

Secondly, the article says that the Face is not a perfect face. It's not like it's staring at us or anything. It's more like a profile, and it's only recognizable because we humans are wired to see faces. It's like when you see a cloud that looks like a dog or something, but it's not actually a dog. It's just our brains playing tricks on us.

Lastly, the article says that there's no evidence of any alien activity on Mars. Like, if there were aliens living there, we would have found some signs of them by now. But we haven't found anything, not even a little green man. So, it's pretty safe to say that the Face is just a natural landform.

Conclusion:
So, there you have it. The Face on Mars is not made by aliens, it's just a natural landform. It's made of rock and soil, shaped by natural processes, and it's not even a perfect face. Plus, there's no evidence of aliens living on Mars. I hope I've convinced you that the Face is not as exciting as it seems. It's still pretty cool though, don't you think?",1,llama_70b_v1,"You have read the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

When most people ask for advice, they usually go to one person that they trust. Maybe that person is a good listener. Maybe that person can interpret what the person is saying. But I think that it is okay to ask multiple people for advice. Most people don't do that, but I am her today to talk about why it is good to ask many people for advice, and what kind of impact it will have on your life.

The first topic I will talk about is how asking many people for advice can give you s bunch of ideas to choose from. If your the type of person that likes to go to one person for advice, I encourage you to go to multiple people for advice, because it can give you a list of ideas to choose from. Meaning if a person gives you advice, but another person gives you really good advice, it would be harder to choose from, because your asking different people, with different opinions towards things.

The next topic I will talk about is you may like other peoples opinions more than others. For instance, lets say that you go to Person A for advice on how to make friends fast. You liked person As advice towards making friends fast. Then, you go to person B for advice to make friends fast. you like person BS opinion more than person As opinion. You decide to go with person BS opinion because you went outside your comfort zone and asked multiple people for advice. then you will have a bunch of ideas of where you want to go with things.

The next topic I will talk about is you may run into someone that you think has the advice your looking for. Their will be many people in the world that will give you negative, and bad advice, but eventually you will run into that ONE person that will have the advice that you are looking for. If you go to the same person for advice every time, you could get tired of what their saying. So you could go to others for advice, because they will have a whole new piece of advice they could give you. It's like a whole new world that your entering. Different people will give you a whole new piece of advice you could use.

The next topic I will talk about is how you can make good decisions by asking multiple people.

If there is somebody that gives you advice that you know your going to get in trouble by using, ask someone else for advice. Ignore the feedback of the person you asked for advice, and go to someone else. Make a wiser decisions by not listening to the bad person. For instance, lets say you really need advice on how to impress this new girl that goes to your school. You think, but you just can't think of anything. You then go to your friend Generic_Name for some gully advice. He then tells you to go to the front of the classroom, and dance while starring right at her. You then get a 3 day suspension all because you chose to follow the advice that was going to get in trouble. Instead, you could have gone to person B for advice. Maybe person B would have gave you some really good advice on how to impress that really hot girl at your school.

I think that everyone should go to multiple people for advice, because it helps them come up with multiple decisions, and it helps you with better decisions from other people. If you havent asked many people for advice, you will after reading my essay.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,6

""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polution""(plaza par.24). I think it is a good idea to banned cars for a few days. This¬† is my opinion because if we take cars away then people will see how much more clear the air is, how much easier it is to breath, what good excersie it is for you, it will open some peoples minds about how the enviroment works and how bad cars are for our economy. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change and this is crossing borders""(riera par.26). It is good because there is so much fog and pollution in the air that it is bad for society and how it is bad for us and the planet that we live on.

Part of the explanation certainly lines in the recession, because cash-strapper amaericans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway""(rosenthal par.32). people now a days dont have enough money to by a car for themselves because there arent enough jobs for all the people becayuse of the big population growth of america.

people are using technology to talk to people, and this means that people dont have to drive as often to go talk to someone. ""demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerste. there hasa been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds gettin a license""(sivak par.38). younger people dont really want to drive to places if they can just talk to people on the phone. some people of this society are lazy because they dont want to get up and go places when they have their phones, but sometimes its for a good reason even if they dont know it they are not polluting the air as much as they would be if they drove to their friends/familys house.

CCD18F76562C,"Some school may assign summer projects for students. Do you think the students or the teacher should make the project idea? Being a student the teacher should fulfill that job,and have topic ideas, examples, and be able to help a long the way. Although, kids want easy projects, teachers will have a better knowledge for what the students need to know, they will have a good list of interesting projects, also they will make it fun all together.

First off, teachers know what you will be learning in the next years course. With them knowing that they will be able to teach you in the summer without them even being there. With the project in the summer it will keep you active in school thinking about how you will want to be organized but also it will prepare you for this up coming course your taking next year.

Second of all, teachers get to know you over 30 some weeks of school. With that they know what your like. Teachers will have fun interesting projects for all the students. When coming to a science fair topic for me its difficult to think off what should i do or will that be allowed. Teachers will take care of all of that though you will have a list of 5 or so topics to choose from. The topics will be educational for your next years class.

Furthermore, you don't want some lazy boring project you want a project that you will become interested in and want to learn more about thats what these teachers will be doing. Some of the projects i have chosen have been the most boring projects i have ever done, the ones teachers have chosen are the far more interesting ones that i want to keep learning about plus the ones i try my hardest on.

In conclusion, kids want easy projects, teachers will have a better knowledge for what the students need to know, they will have a good list of interesting projects, also they will make it fun all together. Those reasons should boost students minds to want to have a fun interesting summer project.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,2
6CA078E0C93F,"the article, Making Mona Lisa Smile, the author describers how a new technology called the facial action coding system enables computers to identify, human emotion the university of amsterdam, Dr. huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and copmputers to communicatre. a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we human use to express we feel. the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the the face, all 44 major musclues in the model must move like human muscles.

the new emotion, recognition softwere track these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa, the different unit, thte softwere can even identify mixed emotion, each expression is compared against a neutral face showing no emotion. the humans perform this same impressive every day. for instance, we can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, that artist such as da vici studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotion.

his new computer softwere stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. perharps Dr. huang emotion algorrithmms are different sort of ""Da Vinc code"" the Mona Lisa demonstration is really internded to bring a smile to thet're face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. a computer that knows when they're happy or sad. if they're smile when a web ad appears on they're screen, a simily ad might follow, but if they're frown, the next ad will be different.

a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. the same technology can make conputer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, note Dr. huang, so computer need to undersatand that tooooo.

had his actor carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotion on stage. feeling someone else's emotion state, may happen because they're unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression. whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotion. Dr. Huang just want people to used the technology about the computer of Making Mona Lisa smile. he want all the wourl people happy of about he did. he just want to see people are smile. he don't want people are sadness. that's why he making these technology.

616C3D5795E8,"As an eighth-grade student, it is important to learn valuable life skills that will benefit us in the future. One of these skills is cleaning. While it may not seem like an exciting task, cleaning our homes is essential for maintaining a healthy and comfortable living environment. In order to improve my house cleaning skills, I propose that I clean the house every Saturday for two months.

Firstly, cleaning the house every Saturday will allow me to practice and improve my cleaning skills on a regular basis. By performing the same tasks every week, I will become more familiar with the cleaning products and techniques that are most effective. This will ultimately lead to a cleaner and more organized home.

Secondly, cleaning the house every Saturday will teach me the importance of responsibility and accountability. By taking on this task, I will be responsible for keeping the house clean and tidy. This will help me develop a sense of ownership and pride in my home, as well as a sense of responsibility towards my family and roommates.

Furthermore, cleaning the house every Saturday will also teach me the importance of time management and organization. In order to effectively clean the house, I will need to plan my time and prioritize my tasks. This will help me develop important skills that will serve me well in the future, both in and out of the classroom.

In conclusion, cleaning the house every Saturday for two months will allow me to practice and improve my house cleaning skills, teach me the importance of responsibility and accountability, and help me develop important skills such as time management and organization. While it may not be the most exciting task, I believe that it is an important one that will benefit me in the long run.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,6
DF249BCF1B57,"Online schooling and virtual classes have become very popular in recent years. More and more schools have offered these online classes as a way for students who can't come into an actual class to get an education. There are many schools all over the United States that offer this program and it would not be suprising if more schools start to offer online education. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students who are sick to get an education, it allows students who have a disability to get an education, and it allows students who are being bullied at school to get an education.

First off, some students can get sick for a very long time or even a short amount time. Either way, students will be missing school and be missing out an getting an education. Whether that is just the common cold, or the flu, the student will most likely not go to school because they do not want to get their peers sick. Especially with the flu that has spread all over America, and the Coronavirus that has spread all over the world, students will not be able to go to school if ill or contaminated. Students who have the oppurtunity to get an online education, will not be effected by an illness and still get the education they deserve.

Next, students who have a disability, mentally or physically, will still be able to get an education with online classes. There are many people in the world who are mentally or physically disabled, who are not getting the education they deserve because they cannot go to school. The medium to small population of disabled people in the United States will be able to learn new things and new ideas just from the implementation of online classes. The physically disabled may not have the means or ability to get to an actual classroom but with virtual classes, the physically disabled will have an oppurtunity to get the same education as the rest of the population. Virtual classes would benefit the disabled incredibly.

Finally, students who are being bullied in school will be able to get an education without being tormented or harrassed. Bullying is an awful epidemic that has only got worse with the introduction of cyberbullying but it has always been terrible in school. A large amount of the population of students in school are bullied and as awful as that is, it is only getting worse. Schools are not doing much about bullying because either the student's don't report it, or the school doesn't do anything about it. With the oppurtunity of online classes and virtual learning, the students who are bullied will be able to get an education in a safe, and comfortable enviorment. Students who are being bullied would love this idea as it allows them to get an education without any terrible distractions.

One may argue that online education limits human to human interaction and will cause the students to be antisocial. However, students in these circumstances will be able to get an education in which everyone deserves, and be able to go to school sponsored social events and do other social things, just not inside a school. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students who are ill to get an education, it allows students who have a mental or physical disability to get an education, and it allows students who are being bullied at school to get an education.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

The author impressively supports that the mission to Venus is worth it despite the dangers that might come with it. In the article he provides examples, uses a credible source, and also views the other side. By doing these things it made his point credible and also stronger to the reader.

In the article he provides the example of a floating car above venus to show that a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the conditions but it would provide little sight. He uses to example to illustrate what it would be like to avoid the conditionsby showing this is what the would have to do. He also provides examples to an alternative by saying that there could be electronics to avoid the risks. By providing both of these examples it gives the reader some relateable examples to get an insight into his point.

NASA is a world wide administration that has credibility over the course of its govern. By providing examples of what NASA is doing to show that it should be done, then if NASA is working on it then it makes his point credible. He quotes NASA'S approches on studying Venus so that it can avoid the risks to show that it is possible to explore Venus without the risks. A NASA solution would be that a person could float above the fray. They also have considered sending electronices so it is possible. He saying that it might be difficult but it is attainable. This supports the claim that he supports his claim impresively because he uses sources.

In most arguments the person views the other side so that they can provide an alternative to what they are saying. He uses cons such as no mission has had a man, 97% of carbon dioxide blankets Venus, the temperature is 90 times greater than Earth, and that it could crash a submarine. But then he says that Venus has benefits to that out way the dangers. The benfits include: it is the brightest point, it is close to Earth compared to other space travels, long ago it could support life, and it will expand the edges of imagination and innovation. He provides benefits to out weigh the cons of exploring Venus. He does a great job of explaining why exploring Venus has value and can provides insight to other counter arguments that might rise from others opionions. This is why he does an impressive job supporting his argument.

Research has shown that students who participate in organized extracurricular activities tend to demonstrate improved academic performance and greater interest in learning. At the same time, parents often become involved in their children's extracurricular activities, providing further support for academic achievement.

However, extracurricular activities can also have negative effects, particularly when students participate in too much activity. A lack of sleep, poor nutrition, and increased stress can all lead to burnout and decreased school performance. Over-scheduling students can also have detrimental effects on their physical and mental health.

For an example, phones shouldn't be used because it can cause an accident, Georgia is a hand free state and lastly it's a distraction.

First off, phones shouldn't be used because it can cause an accident. The usage of phones is way too high to be used while driving. Did you know teenagers are having accidents because of these phones? The death rate went up because of using a phone while driving seems to be more important than our lives.

Another reason why phones shouldn't be use is because Georgia is a hand free state. You can end up with a glove department fool of tickets because of this phone problem. Now you have to come out the pocket to pay this ticket when you could have obeyed the law. This play a large roll because you can't stay of your phone to save lives. This play a large roll because the law is trying to save lives.

Last but not least, the phone is a huge distraction to the people who is driving. I say this because I seen it with my own eyes that a phone can distract a person. In the blink of the eye you might end up swerving around a car or probably worse. Also this can be prevented if the diver ignores everything on the outside.

F2BAC6095D8A,"Online classes vs. Traditional Classroom-Based Education: A Comprehensive Comparison

As an 8th grader, I have had the opportunity to experience both online and traditional classroom-based education, and I must say, they have their own set of pros and cons. In this essay, I will outline the differences between these two types of learning environments in terms of academic achievement, engagement levels, and potential for early graduation.

Academic Achievement:

When it comes to academic achievement, traditional classroom-based education has been proven to be more effective. According to a study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, students who attend traditional schools tend to perform better on standardized tests and have higher graduation rates compared to their online counterparts. This is because traditional schools provide a more structured and interactive learning environment, which allows students to receive immediate feedback from teachers and engage in face-to-face discussions with their peers. On the other hand, online classes can be more isolating, which can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement.

Engagement Levels:

When it comes to engagement levels, online classes have a clear advantage. Students who take online classes have reported higher levels of engagement and motivation compared to their traditional classroom-based counterparts. This is because online classes provide more flexibility and autonomy, allowing students to learn at their own pace and according to their own interests. Additionally, online classes often include interactive elements such as discussion forums and virtual labs, which can make learning more enjoyable and engaging.

Early Graduation:

Both types of learning environments have their own pros and cons when it comes to early graduation. Traditional classroom-based education provides a more structured and predictable learning environment, which can help students stay on track and graduate on time. However, online classes can also provide opportunities for early graduation, as they often offer more flexibility and autonomy, allowing students to complete coursework at their own pace.

Pros and Cons of Online Classes:

Pros:

* More flexibility and autonomy
* Higher levels of engagement and motivation
* More interactive and enjoyable learning experience

CF52358A03FF,"Of all things that you would want to learn about the human face, what would you want to know about the most? In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" author Nick D'Alto explains why and how emotional expression is valuable. In this instance, being able to tell what emotions people would have by using smart computer programs such as the ""Faciak Action Coding"" system would be revolutionary. This would be an amazing ability to have because it could most likely help people with a lot of life problems.

D'Alto explains that by calculating the facial muscles in the human face, his example being the face of the Mona Lisa, you could instantly detect each emotion like a simple math equation. This would be very helpful because it could help people with things such as school. D'Alto supports that claim by quoting Dr. Thomas Huang, who says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", and that if the computer does recognize the situation ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human

390767AFC219,"Driverless cars are featured in the a lot of sci-fy movies, but are they really as wonderful as movies make them seem? This question is what is being adressed in the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"". A fully driverless car would not be optimal because the whole idea would be too expensive to address, nobody will pay attention to the road at all, and things could easily go wrong with a machine.

First I will explain how the whole idea of these 'driverless cars' would be too exensive. As stated in paragraph 3, ""...they require massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical"". Now in this situation, they are talking about these roadways that would control the driverless cars. But, even if we didnt make the roads entirely like suggested in the article, we would still have to change roads all across America in some ways because they wouldn't be fit for a car to control. This would also suggest that off roading, or back road driving would be very challenging for any vehical, or computer to handle.

Second, I will explain how people will not pay attention to the roads at all. How exactally can you be certian that someone is doing something they are supposed to do? How can you force them? You can't. The most ideal way that these 'driverless cars' would be used, would be to assist companies with deliveries, so the driver of the truck could sleep and the truck could continue driving through the night, less stops = ideal time of delivery. But if the driver has to stay alert the whole time to take over in rough situations, they what even is the point of having automated cars past the point of assistance?

Lastly, I would like to address that things go wrong with machines all the time. So what would make a 'driverless car' any different? If we have to constantly be worried about how the automated car is running, or how the condition of it is, then we might as well just take that effort and apply it to ourselves. I can bet that these cars will not be 100% accident free, and neither are people. So if they arent really gong to benefit us in a large way, what would be the point of all the effort that would go into making this possible? Here's the answer; there isnt one.

In conclusion, a fully driverless car would not be optimal because the whole idea would be too expensive to address, nobody will pay attention to the road at all, and things could easily go wrong with a machine. So to answer my questions; no, driverless cars are not as wonderful as they seem. Yes they are a nice thought and after being perfected could probably help out the shipping industries a lot. Personally, I wouldn't want to drive on a road filled with people not paying attention. In worse case senarios, everyone involved would be caught off guard causing more harm than good.

78A3B43DFF8E,"Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" While I understand the sentiment behind this statement, I believe that success is not just about having the courage to continue in the face of failure, but also about the ability to learn from those failures and use them as stepping stones towards success.

Throughout my life, I have experienced both successes and failures, and I have learned valuable lessons from each one. For example, when I was in the 6th grade, I tried out for the school's debate team. I had been practicing for weeks, but on the day of the tryouts, I was nervous and didn't perform my best. I was disappointed when I didn't make the team, but instead of giving up, I decided to take the feedback I received and use it to improve my skills. I practiced even more, sought out feedback from my teachers, and eventually made the team the following year.

Similarly, when I took my first math test in the 7th grade, I got a score of 50 out of 100. While I was disappointed, I knew that I could improve. I asked my teacher for help, studied more, and took practice tests. By the time the next test came around, I had improved my score by 10 points.

In both of these examples, I was able to learn from my failures and use them as stepping stones towards success. I believe that this is the true definition of success, not just the ability to continue in the face of failure.

Furthermore, I believe that the loss of enthusiasm is not a necessary component of success. In fact, I believe that enthusiasm is what drives us towards success. When we are enthusiastic about something, we are more likely to put in the hard work and effort necessary to achieve our goals. We are more likely to take risks and try new things, even when we may fail.

In conclusion, while Winston Churchill's statement about success is inspiring, I believe that it is not the whole picture. Success is not just about having the courage to continue in the face of failure, but also about the ability to learn from those failures and use them as stepping stones towards success. Furthermore, I believe that enthusiasm is what drives us towards success, not its absence.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,5

One point of evidence is that in 2013, BMW announced the development of the '' Traffic Jam Assistant''. So this means that when you are driving up to 25 mph you have a smart car , but when you go over 25 mph you have just a normal car . See the point that I'm trying to make is that when people had a little bit to much to drink and they go over 25 mph they're like a missle that can blow up at any time. Some sensors on the car may fail while you are driving , lets say if your driving down the street in a BMW at 20 mph and a car passes you and your not looking and you happen to run into it, its the cars fault and the owner because the driver should've been looking and the car should've stop on the dime. Because BMW developed this new System and its mention in paragraph 7 '' The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph , but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Also mention by BMW ''They can steer, accelerate, and brake by themsevles. So if the driver in this situation was looking down at a phone lets say ,and runs into the back of someones car who's fault would it have been ? I would have blame the manfacturer company because they said that the car is supose to brake themselves if danger is near or coming up . So if the owner was hurt then it would've been on manufacturer company all because they said that this car had sensors that could alert the drivers. Also which leads to another point lets say that the sensors fail without the driver knowing and she was driving a little bit reckless then that would been her fault and the cars. So I think that people should stop driving so reckless and start paying attention to the road . Also I think that a new law should be passed saying that car companies should recall their cars every 5 to 6 years to upgrade the safety quality on their cars. This will safe a numerous amout of people's lives and increase the amount of cars being sold by BMW. ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

A8411CE08C68,"The president of the United States should be decided by the Electoral College process, not by most popular vote. There are many reasons why we should keep the way we vote the same.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in it's Congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of Representatives and plus two for your senators. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. When we vote this way, there's a certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign effforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Ellectoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the Constistution.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

We definatly need to continue using the Electoral College process. The most popular vote process wouldn't be an ideal way to elect a president.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1

118C90DCC636,"Having to do school work over the summer? Summer assignments is a great way for students to not forget everything they learned over the school year. If a student goes from June to September without reviewing their course material from the previous years, they are bound to forgetting lots of important information. Students have very creative minds and should be able to come up with their own way of studying or going over past information. Teacher designed assignments can force students to do unnecessary research which can waste a lot¬†of time. Summer projects should be student designed because it allows each student to put their time in to something that interests them, teachers can learn more about their future students, and teacher designed projects sometimes¬†dis encourage¬†students to complete them.

There is nothing better in school or in life when you are interested in a subject. It is much easier to pay attention and a lot more information that sticks with you. Doing a lot of research into a topic your not interested in is more or less a waste of time. A project led by a student could influence others to a career choice. Having to do work is never fun especially in summer but if students get to be creative they can find a topic which makes it more enjoyable. Teacher designed projects limits students into following certain formats and structures which limits the thought process being taken into place thinking about the project. Once again interesting topics lead to better productivity and work which is why students need to design their own projects.

Forming relationships as a teacher is something that can change a students life forever. There are many kids in today society who feel like they don't belong or fit in. Knowing and appreciating someone the smallest can impact them more than someone can imagine. A student who creates their own project or structure will definitely tell you something about them. Engaging students with each others work is important to show the passion one may have for what they made. Student designed projects open up the opportunity to really show how much a subject matters and what can be done to change a way in society that is failing. Teachers knowing more about their students is important for students to want to come to class and for teachers to know when someone is not appearing to be feeling their normal selves.

Teacher designed projects are usually straight¬†forward. When a student designs a project they complete much more work. Now I would say that if the students are below 5th grade having teacher designed projects is the better option due to most students at that level not being educated enough to think outside of the box. Regardless learning will take place on both sides and that students will dive deep enough into a subject to break the ice. Relationships will form from students bonding over ideas and sharing them with each other.

When the question ""should a teacher or student design a summer project?"" comes up, I am aware that both sides has an argument but that students designing it is way more impactful to themselves and others. Career choices can easily be introduced while just selecting a topic. Forcing students to be oppurtunitive and aware student designed projects open it all up and enable them to select something that is interesting and important. Teacher designed projects are good when there is not a lot of time but having the whole summer gives each student many hours to work on an design their own masterpiece.",0,persuade_corpus,,1
19AA537480D4,"I think that the use of the new technology to read the emotional expressions of people is not valuable. If people want to tell you how they feel, then they probably will. I do not think you should ""invade"" their privacy, feelings, and emotions. People have their own feelings and they have them because they are THEIRS. If they wanted to share their feelings then they would. But a lot of people want to keep their feelings to themselves.

Humans every day kind of do the same thing as this new technology does. The article states "" In fact, we as humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" Which is true, because if say we see a friend who is upset about something, and they are not really crying or anything, but you can just tell by their face that they are upset; then that's using a ""humanized version"" of the new technology. That is almost the same thing as the new technology, except with the new technology it literally SCANS your face and has access to your personal emotions. It invades your private mind.

Another reason that supports my opinion is that the student's peers could find out the results from a person's scan and tell everybody when most people want to keep their feelings/emotions to themselves. This is not a good idea, it is sharing to all kinds of other people how someone feels and that is not okay. You have to let people have their own thoughts. When they did the scan on da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting, that is fine because it's just a painting. The painting is not a living thing with feelings.

I think that if someone wants to use the new technology to scan historic pictures or historic things then that is okay. I think it's important to understand our past. If finding out what someone from the past was feeling helps us understand history then yeah sure! Why not do it. It's not going to hurt anybody or anything like if you were to use the technology on something living.

In conclusion, I believe that we should not use the new technology on anything that is living and has feelings. But I think that it is okay to use it on historic things (like da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting) so we can really truly understand the word's past. It is important for people to have their own feelings, emotions, and thoughts. It is also okay for people to share their feelings. But they should not always have to share them. I feel like in a way, this new technology is ""forcing"" people to share their emotions, feelings, etc.          ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
E19E1BEB08EA,"Working with a partner on school projects and assignments can be extremely beneficial for students. I have personally experienced the benefits of working with a partner on multiple occasions and have come to the conclusion that it is a valuable tool for students. In this essay, I will explain the reasons why working with a partner is beneficial and why it is especially beneficial for teams of at least three on bigger projects and assignments.

One of the main benefits of working with a partner is that it allows for the sharing of ideas and resources. When working alone, it can be difficult to come up with new and creative ideas, but when working with a partner, there is an opportunity to bounce ideas off of each other and come up with even more innovative solutions. Additionally, working with a partner allows for the sharing of resources such as time, knowledge, and skills. This can be especially beneficial for students who may not have access to certain resources or who may be struggling with a particular concept.

Another benefit of working with a partner is that it allows for the development of important skills such as communication and collaboration. When working with a partner, it is essential to communicate effectively and collaborate in order to complete the project successfully. This can help students develop these skills, which are essential for success in the workplace and in life in general.

Working with a partner can also be beneficial for teams of at least three on bigger projects and assignments. In these cases, the benefits of working with a partner are magnified. For example, when working on a group project, there are often multiple perspectives and ideas to consider. Working with a partner allows for the sharing of these perspectives and ideas, which can lead to a more well-rounded and thoughtful final product. Additionally, when working on a bigger project, there may be more work to be done and more resources needed. Working with a partner allows for the sharing of these resources and the division of labor, which can help the team complete the project more efficiently.

In conclusion, working with a partner on school projects and assignments can be extremely beneficial for students. It allows for the sharing of ideas and resources, the development of important skills such as communication and collaboration, and can be especially beneficial for teams of at least three on bigger projects and assignments. I have personally experienced the benefits of working with a partner and believe that it is a valuable tool for students.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,5
61C4FCA012D7,"The school food should change because a lot of students they did not like it and many students feel sick when they eat school food and many students skip their lunch to go and buy food from stores if schools provides the same food for student many students will leave class and learn they will not lean anything for being late in the class and more.

The school lunch should to be healthier for student to eat. Otherwise many students will not go to their class or lunch because they skip class to go buy food. Many students at my school argue that the food should change. And others student say the food should stay the same because they like it and it healthier for them. For example one day at my school students got into agreement saying that they are happy with the school menus that they have those why many students do not skip classes. Other students may not like the idea of changing because they think the new change will worst then they have.

If schools change to healthier food for students many student will be in the class to learn and stop thinking about skiing class to go buy food. For example one of my classmate always goes out to from school during class to buy food and i ask him why he said the school food are not good enough for him and those the problem he skip class to go to buy food. changing school food will be good idea and also bad because same students want same food they have now day but other want change and those where all arguing start. The good way to make students happy about is to keep the one they most like and get ruined of the one they do not like.

Some may argue that changing school menu would be bad idea because the new menu would be something that the students may not like do or not healthier for them. Other people think that many students get sick when they eat school food and many students are not learning and they do not go to classes in time or they skip same periods. In my idea i think changing school menu would be good idea because the menus that school provides are not healthier and same of them are not good for our bodies. The best way to provides healthy food for student is change the menu that most students heat.

To summarize, the main reason to change school menus is there are many students agree with the idea and there same who disagree about changing the school menu. I think good way to solve this problem is they have to keep the menu they already have and students like to eat most. And change for those who agree with the idea. Otherwise it will clause same problem for school principal.",0,original_moth,"Task:

C582EB969552,"As an eighth-grade student, I have learned the importance of kindness and generosity. I remember one time when I performed an act of kindness for my friend, and it made me feel good inside.

My friend, Sarah, had been struggling with her schoolwork lately, and she was feeling overwhelmed. She had been putting in a lot of effort, but she just couldn't seem to get ahead. I knew that she needed someone to talk to, so I decided to offer my help.

I invited Sarah over to my house, and we spent the afternoon working on her homework together. We went over the material, and I helped her understand the concepts better. I also encouraged her to take breaks and relax, which helped her feel more focused.

After we finished, Sarah thanked me for my help. She said that she felt so much better and more confident. I was happy to hear that, and it made me feel good to know that I had made a difference in her life.

From that day on, Sarah and I continued to work together on her homework. We would meet up at my house or her house, and we would spend hours going over the material. We became good friends, and we supported each other through thick and thin.

Looking back on that experience, I realize that performing an act of kindness can have a significant impact on someone's life.

It cant go thou are mind and say they are feeling sad. Us humans can tell if they are sad or happy because we have been thou the same things they are going thou.

If it is true I would not use because if they are using it as a govement weapon to find if some one is hinding some well needed things and they start to used this and if it gives them wrong information that person might be in some trouble.

NASA on 1976 took a photo of Mars, nothing odd right except this odd looking thing that looked like a face. Many scientist thought it was just a land mass that happen to look like a face but the people around the world though of it as an aliens doing.

This idea is wrong in many levels for instant years later they took another photo and it shows that is was nothing but a butte or mesa, but this still did not stop people thinking other wise.

CF288DDE1328,"Most student enjoy summer vacations, but some educators believe that summer break is too long and that students do not retain information easily. Educators argue that there should be a year-around school, where there would be a 3-4 week off in the spring and fall. But as a student, my position is the opposite of what some educators believe. If our summer keeps as all this past years we can do so many things. When our summer vacations arrive is when all students fell free and out of pression of passing the course year. Summer vacations also open different doors in our life, students chooises are vacations and traveling, others prefer to work, gain money and experience for our future. If summer vacations will be shorter not many students could handdle school, beaks in summer, longer winter break and summer would not have the same impact as summer vactions. It can sound exagerate but that wouldn't be much time to us for do our sumer change.

First of all, In my own experience I like when summer is coming because I know that new experience are waiting for me, but also I like summer vacations because all the ""suffer"" of final examns and the S.O.L are over once again, and I think passing your goals during the years always deserves and award, in this case, Summer vacations. What educators don't see about summer is that gives us an opportnity to be more responsable; many students like me decide to start working. Working has made me a more responsable man, has teach me how reality is, and that money is not an easy thing, and the easier way I can make money is study. Summer is one of the greates time for students, many students go to new places, to visit old family menbers and pass time whit them. Summer last year gived me the chance to go back to my countrie, I couln't do it during winter or spring because I have to study, and the time educators think is the best for us would't provide the same amount of aventures.

More over, When winter break is coming we all happy but it feels too short, adding a few days wouldn't make it so different, plus your adding the same amount of days in four seasons, time for us will pass flying. I also think that many of us would fell like school is never going to end, I would be so stress out that my preformence during the school could be decreasing more and more. Last time I looked an article were they showed a chart, out of 100 student 80 said that they prefere summer vacations over having longers breaks during the year. After that they made an experiment, during a year they sow how was the performence in the students who's choices was summer vacation, and it got prooved that they were doing better because they were constanly going to school.

On the other hand, educators are not at all wrong, when I start againg the school year I some times don't remenber thing that I sow the year before. Also having so much vacations makes me miss school, been with my friends and learning new things. Educators may have a diferet opinion than I, and they can be the one's who are correct, they said that summer is too long because of their experience, and maybe they had learn less. Educators are people who know more than students because of their understanding in the power of learnig.

In conclusion, summer vacations is the best, and it never has to change the aumount of days that they give to us, is prefectly the days that we all need to refresh from school and things that happened over the year.

Summer bring us new experience and it teachs us things like reponsability, a very importat human thing that we all has to have. I beliebe that we things shouldn't change, people and cientificts had prooved that the best way of lerning is how we do it.",0,original_moth,"Task:

8E4BBBA4018F,"Students think of school as a stressful and challenging obstacle.¬†The amount of work put on them causes them to think that school is not a place for them. School is supposed to be a place where we can identify our future career path. Having these classes can help students think of school as a nurturing environment and not a terrifying world of homework. I definitely agree with the principals choice of making a mandatory extra-curriculum class, since it can have a lot of positive effects on the students. Having these extra classes will help the kids control their mental health and help them pursue their future career goals. It will also encourage them to try new activities.

Having extra-curriculum classes will help the students control their mental health. School can be very stressful and this is one way to overcome the stress. These classes will help them forget about the other class for a while and relax the body. For example, for students who enjoy to do art and work with their hands freely, pottery classes are excellent. Pottery class can help them forget about the stress they had in their other classes and let out the stress in a calming way. Next, students take tests as a terrifying piece of paper and that can make them worry for the whole day. The extra classes will help them forget about the test for a while and clear their mind. Science has shown that doing an activity that we enjoy can help us do better on the test, since we have a clear mindset. An example is I had my writing sol and circles quiz on the same day. I had two major things to worry about and that was really scary. Once I was done with my writing sol I still had band and math to go to. When I went to band, it helped me forget that I had a math quiz today and cleared my mind before. When I headed out to math and started taking the quiz I thought the quiz was really easy and I don't know why I was so terrified of this quiz. Finally, the extra classes lets the brain stop taking in information to just rearrange the ideas and to relax it. Having so much information in the brain can cause the student to forget important factors. If a student is playing a sport he or she enjoys like soccer, taking a class on soccer can not only let the student have fun, but also relax the brain and be free. The extra curriculum activities can help fix these three mental health weaknesses.

Secondly, these classes can help pursue their future career goals. Some students already know what they want to go into when they grow older and they want to take classes that will help them lead up to their dream career. Letting the kids have a mandatory extra-curriculum class can help the kids lead to reaching that goal. For example, if a student wants to major in culinary arts, doing a cooking class would be good. It can teach him or her new skills that will help him or her get better. Another reason why extra activities help pursue future goals is the classes will go deeper into the topic the student wants to pursue. If a student wants to go into Microbiology, they not only have to take life science, but they need to take a class about biology. This class can go even more deeper about microbiology. Taking these classes or activities can go further into the knowledge of the topic. Lastly, for students who don't know what career path they want to go through they have a chance to see what they might like. Having these classes opens up a wide variety of activities that students can do and they can see if they enjoy it or not. Depending if they like it or not they have a choice of going through that pathway in the future. As shown, having these different classes can help pursue or find future career pathways and goals.

The last reason why we should have these extra activities or classes is it helps us try new activities. Some students are very quiet and are a introvert. They don't really talk to people much and they keep their thoughts inside most of the time. For someone like them having these classes will help them open up more and try something new like being part of a student leadership council. Another way these activities help us try new activities is they will help the student see their likes and dislikes of a topic. For example, I never enjoyed sewing and during seventh grade we had to take FACS which was a class where you learn about family, cooking, and sewing. When we came to the sewing topic I wasn't very interested with the machines and the idea of sewing in general. Once we started our first project which was building an ear bud¬†pouch I started to enjoy doing things with the sewing machine. I soon fell in love with sewing and one of my likes is sewing. This shows how trying somethings can be positive. The final reason that extra classes help us try new activities is it can open up many ideas or thoughts about the activity and opens up pathways to go through in the future. For example, if a student tried leadership council and enjoyed it, they might want to continue being a leader and become a lawyer in the future. In conclusion, this shows that having these extra classes can make students try something new and different.

I agree with the principals choice that each student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Having these classes will have a big impact on the students, such as controlling their mental health, pursuing their future career goals, and encouraging them to try different activities. Having the extra classes will help the students have a better view of how school is and why we come here.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,4

First,In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author says ""Earth's ""Twin"", Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". Since it has a lot in common with Earth it is good to have a litle insight on this planet. In the article it says that"" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sich as valleys, moutains, and craters"" this shows how much Earth and venus have incommon. This also gives us an opertunity to take a planetary visit to Venus in the future. Despite the dangers it could cause on someone.

Next, in the reading it says that Venus has"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxid blankets"" This is one example of how dangerous Venus is. In the article is says"" Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperatue of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun"" This is another example of how dangers Venus is. However going to Venus is not a bad idea beacuse life form could have been there in the past. People believe life forms could have existed beacuse of the examples like caters, moutains, and valleys. Despite Venus being the hottest planet in our solar system.

Then, on that note Venus is not the cloestet planet to the sun but has the highest tempature than all of your planet's in the solar system. However studying Venus can give us insight on what to make to prevent for somone or something burning on its surface. While we have been studying Venus all we have seen is a look from a ship orbiting above the planet, that gives us little intel on it surface. We get little intil from that beaucse "" most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere"". However if scientists seeking to conduct Venus will have to get closer to the planet.

Lastly, in the reading it says"" Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"" but not all people know that Venus is not a star it is a planet. However to a amateur stargazer it may just look like another star. Venus is called Earths twin beaucse of how alike they are in distance.

D96EF27304E5,"Should schools control how many extracurricular activities you take? There should be a certain extent in when schools can control how many out of school activities your in. The students family should be the deciding factor in whether you leave or not. That is if you start to fail classes, your parents ask the school to take you out of some, or if your attendance towards the meetings look bad. Then that is when the school helps decides what happens towards the student.

First of all, I think it should be a certain extent in what you can enroll for but it should always be up to the student and their families since that is a major factor inn deciding what to do. If the family thinks the child has no time to do homework or study for upcoming test then they should talk to the student about the issue and hear what the student has to say. If the family decides on letting the child continue is upon them but if they chose to take their child out of the extracurricular activities the must notify the child's guidance counselor and notify the main person in the activity

However, if the students starts to fail classes or most of your grades keeps dropping the the students guidance counselor should talk to the student and see why. If they see to many extracurricular activities then there should be a talk with the student to see which ones he can drop for the time until the grades are up. This should encourage the student that if they want to be a part of the activities the they have to be able to maintain their grades.

Lastly, if the child's attendance to the meetings are bad and are inconstant they should not be allowed to participate in the extracurricular activities. The child should only miss up to five meetings per month with out any consequences. By making the child leave the club and notifying their parents the reason why then should the child be kicked out. Without furthermore, reasons the child could be suspended from coming to the meetings for a certain amount of time.

In conclusion, the school should have very little say in the decision of a student being apart of a extracurricular activity.

36DF4C0101F2,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Although summer break is a time for students and teachers to relax, it is still important for students to continue learning. Coming back from summer break can be hard on students because they usually have not done any work at home. Something that could help students stay actively learning is a summer project. Opponents wrongly believe summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers would chose a project that stays on the curriculum and all students would be doing the same project. Although some may believe summer projects should be teacher designed, it should be known summer projects should be student designed.

There are a few short term benefits from students designing their own projects. Students are more likely to do a better job on the project if they are student designed. If the student picks what he is doing his project on he is more likely to do a better job on it. For example, when I get a project that is teacher designed I am less likely to put effort into it. It gets students more excited about doing work when they are familiar with the topic. This would also benefit students because they know what they are capable of doing. Students might have to spend money on a project because they do not have the materials for the project that the teacher assigned. For example, I find it easier to do projects on subjects that I'm well aware of. It would be easier on the student if they could do a project within their limits. Students would have a much more enjoyable experience if they were allowed to design the project. Usually when students have a good time doing work they do¬†a better job on it. For example, when my elementary school did science fairs the students always got to pick the topic we used in the project, it was much more enjoyable than when the teacher picked it. There is no point in students doing a project they are not passionate about.

There are also long term benefits from students designing their own projects. Students designing their own projects can help teach them creativity. Students always have to follow exactly what the teacher says and that leaves no room for creativity. For example, every time I get to design my own projects I discover new artistic abilities I never knew I had. This can help students in the future by reminding them not everything has to come out of a book and it is okay to have original ideas. Another long term benefit would be protecting students self esteem. If a student is struggling to complete a project that the teacher assigned it could lower their self esteem. For example, I have had many projects that have made me feel like I was not as smart as the other students because I did not understand the work. A build up of failed attempts could lead to students doubting themselves and giving up, however if the student designs their own project they are more likely to succeed. Lastly, it gives students a chance to be independent. Little things like simply designing their own project can go a long way. For example, I always feel better after accomplishing a project that I designed by myself. Over time students could develop real world skills from simply designing their own projects.

Although some may believe summer projects should be teacher designed, it should be known summer projects should be student designed. The opposition incorrectly believes summer projects should be teacher designed because kids will struggle to find something to do and teachers know what they need to learn. Summer projects should be student designed because they will do a better job on it, students know what they are capable of doing, and it is more enjoyable. Additionally, it teaches creativity, boosts self esteem, and it gives students the chance to be independent. Schools should take this into serious consideration so students can stay activley learning in an easy way while also having fun doing it.",0,persuade_corpus,,5

Finally, as children become adults, having someone with experience to act as a sounding board to discuss career opportunities, sports, social situations, and relationships, can be key to making wise choices. A parent or guardian who is wise and experienced can help a young adult tap into their strengths and teach them how to find and develop wisdom.

To sum up, wisdom and experience from a parent or guardian can be invaluable. While a young person might be more independent, those with parents or guardians to help guide them on their journey will have a much greater chance of success and fulfillment in life.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Write an essay that explores the importance of obtaining wisdom and experience from someone like a parent or guardian.,5

In the story the author talks about many ways we could overcome the risky challenges that Venus has and what could happen if something does go bad. The author also gives good points on how Venus could be a nearest option for a planetary visit. Also how its often referred to as Earth's ""Twin"", and how Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size.

The atuthor talks about how humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus but none of them survived. He also talks about NASA has been working on other approaches to studying Venus, like a silicon carbide has been tested in caber simulating the environment of Venus's surface. It has lasted for three weeks in that type of conditions. If they keep testing and fixing or inproven the project then they maybe one day make a another one that can surive that type of environment and get the researchers the samples they need to learn more about Venus.

Using a mobile phone while driving can be distracting to most people, especially the younger generations. This makes is very dangerous and there have been horrible accidents and even deaths to happen while texting and driving in particular. While this may be a true fact, there are different ways you can control the use of cell phones while driving.

Some states have made it illegal to use a cell phone while driving and others passed laws that enable your use of cell phones restricted like Georgia and the hands free law. Some may argue that the hands free law is not safer than holding a phone while driving. I think that there are more things that can be put in place to assist with the use of cell phones and driving.

My argument is that I believe we should be able to use cell phones in a more restricted way which will eventually save lives. We currently live in a world where technology rules us as humans. I say why not allow it to rule us in a safe way. We have self-driving cars; hands free voice to type mechanisms on our devices and even most vehicles that are being made now can read your text for you as you drive. In my opinion, if we use more of these mechanisms properly it would save more lives. Self driving cars will allow us not to be worried about driving on the road; if you insist on texting and driving, why not use the voice to text feature on your phone and finally purchasing a vehicle that will read and type the text to you.

While my theories seem far fetched, I believe one day we will be able to live in a world where we will be able to operate cell phones and drive on a daily basis without getting hurt. Technology has brought us this far we should be able to go further if we invent ways to use it in a safe and responsible manner.      ",0,persuade_corpus,,9
6FC1CB4C0CCF,"Let's see can students benefit from learning at home then attending a regular school.

Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home either online or video chatting. In my opinion many students think that learning at home is easier and that they'll focus on school more. Students think that they'll have less distraction at home then in school,they get there work done,and be to classes on time. I support both issues of attending regular school or online school they have there advantages and disadvantages.

Attending classes at school is more beneficial¬†because you have a teacher right in front¬†to help you understand and keep you focus in your classes. You also have friends that you can talk to and discuss you answers with your classmates share ideas and answers you have for any class¬†work you need to turn in. If you have any special need going to a school is much better because they will help you learn and will help you with anything you struggling with,also they can give you classwork to understand each class your having trouble in. You wont miss out on any school events if your in high school youll enjoy going to prom or homecoming going to any sport games etc. Attending school is much more fun you get to interact with other students learn about they life and even other things you want to know about them.

Why i disagree with online or video conferencing classes, is because many students think that having online classes they have a right to do whatever they want, dont get me wrong they do but they also have a schedule¬†of what time there classes start they might have an option to wake up at anytime. But now matter if you have different options or more time to do what you want to,you have to attend your class everyday. having online classes could be a good use if your going on a vacation or are sick for any good reason then you will have the need to use an online system that will help you catch up on anything you could need will miss. You could be able to graduate on time or even earlier if you complete all your courses.

Classes at school can be better taught and have technology available to use. Students may think that not going to school thinking¬†that it wont effect there school performance which is not true because you can de changed to online school which some students will regret some won't. some people dont make a smart choice and chose whats gonna make it harder for them to learning and understand school also then dont see what they really want in life they just take ""an easy"" way out of everything.

In conclusion,can students benefit from learning at home then attending a regular school. I support the people who attend school and not online classes because they have different ways of learning new things and interacting with new people. Online school students could have trouble pay and even understanding time and might have limited time of help they could use. I find attending school easy and faster to learn new ways of every other thing.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
534F8FD6D72C,"Dear principal,

I think it is a wonderful idea to have all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME to have to do community service. There are a lot of things we could do to help our community out. We could go around the city and city parks to pick up trash that nasty and lazy people didn't put in the trash can. We could have a babysitting service for single parents who cannot afford to pay for daycare or a babysitter. We could have a club were we go around to old homes and take the old people to places like the zoo or the movies.

You can also use community service as something you have to have an amount of hours to past middle school. Instead of just high school. I believe that if we all take a part of community service we would have less drama on the streets. We could have teams were kids that need help(special ed) could come and have fun without having mean people make fun of them. Every once in a while we could have a game were the money we raise goes to a type of sickness that they are trying to find a cure for.

If we all come together we could come up with a lot of ways to improve the community that involves with helping the community. Some people don't know that if you help the community out every once in a while you fell good inside. If some of these people fell good inside there wouldn't be as much killing as there is. that would be an awesome thing. So I really think that community service should be required.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

I will explain how drivers can be able to use their cellphones and how they can't use their cellphones.

there are many resources that you can use to help you understand whether or not cellphone usage is allowed. there are some pros for cell phone usage and some cons for cell phone usage. I really prefer not using cellphones.

Drivers should not use their cellphones while they are driving because a lot of things could happen like getting in car accidents, getting pulled over by the cops, killing somebody else that is like crossing the road or street and you could get arrested. One reason why they shouldn't have cellphones because people insurance bill or rates goes up. People dealing with health problems and car accidents. Drivers be looking down at their phones and trying to text back to someone while driving which means that they are being distracted.

Drivers are allowed to use their cell phones only if they are talking on the phone while the phone is on speaker.

Drivers can talk on the phone through bluetooth headphones.

Drivers can also talk on phones, leave a message, call someone, and more on bluetooth in cars that only have a bluetooth speaker in them. If drivers have a passenger sitting beside them, then they could ask them if they could text, call, leave a message, or anything else to that person they are trying to reach.

llama_70b_v11149,"Marijuana, also known as weed or cannabis, has been a topic of discussion for a while now. Some people argue that it should be legalized, while others believe it should remain illegal. In my opinion, marijuana should be legalized.

Firstly, it is important to note that marijuana has several medical benefits. It can be used to treat chronic pain, anxiety, and even some types of cancer. Patients who suffer from these conditions can benefit greatly from the use of marijuana. Moreover, it is a natural herb and has less side effects compared to other synthetic medications.

Secondly, legalizing marijuana can help reduce crime rates. The illegal drug trade is a major cause of criminal activity, including drug trafficking and gang violence. By legalizing marijuana, the government can regulate and control its production and distribution, reducing the power of drug cartels and criminal organizations. Additionally, law enforcement resources can be directed towards more serious crimes, such as violent crimes.

Thirdly, legalizing marijuana can generate significant revenue for the government. If marijuana is legalized, it can be taxed, providing a new source of income for the government. This revenue can be used to fund important public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that prohibition does not work. The war on drugs has been a failure, and it has not stopped people from using drugs. Instead, it has led to the criminalization of millions of people, mostly for non-violent drug offenses. By legalizing marijuana, we can focus on treatment and education rather than punishment.

However, some people argue that legalizing marijuana can lead to increased drug use and abuse. They believe that it can impair cognitive function, judgment, and decision-making skills, which can have negative consequences on society.

In conclusion, while there are some valid concerns about the legalization of marijuana, the benefits of legalization far outweigh the drawbacks. It can provide relief to patients, reduce crime rates, generate revenue, and end the failed war on drugs. It is important to ensure that marijuana is regulated and controlled properly to minimize the potential negative effects. Ultimately, the legalization of marijuana is a step towards a safer, healthier, and more just society.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The legalization of marijuana has been a controversial topic in recent years.

8C34447FF21C,"Hey, I'm like, totally stoked to be writing this essay!  So, you know, bullying is like, super important to talk about, right? Like, it's not cool to be mean to other people, but sometimes people do it anyway. And, like, it can have some serious consequences, man.

So, first off, let's talk about why people bully others. I think it's because they're insecure or they don't feel good about themselves, so they try to bring others down. It's like, they're trying to make themselves feel better by making someone else feel worse. And, like, it's not okay, you know? It's not right to hurt someone just to make yourself feel better.

But, like, the thing is, bullying can have some serious psychological consequences for the person being bullied. It can make them feel really anxious, depressed, and even suicidal. It's like, they start to feel like they're worthless and that they don't have any friends, and it's just, like, really sad. And, like, it's not their fault, you know? They didn't do anything to deserve it.

And, like, the legal consequences can be pretty severe too. Depending on the situation, bullying can be considered harassment or even assault, and the person doing it can get in trouble with the law. It's like, they could get arrested or even charged with a crime, and that's not cool, man.

So, like, how can we address bullying? I think we need to, like, educate people about why it's not okay to bully others. We need to teach them about empathy and compassion, and how to treat others with kindness and respect. And, like, we need to create a safe and supportive environment where people feel comfortable talking about their feelings and getting help if they need it.

And, like, the schools and the government need to do something too. They need to have policies in place to prevent bullying and to punish people who do it. It's like, they need to make it clear that bullying is not acceptable and that there will be consequences for people who do it",1,llama2_chat,"Task: Analyze why people bully other people, and what the implications for those who bully are.

aa458fc2,"There is a lot controversy regarding the Electoral College system of voting in the United States. Some voting members would argue that the system, although flawed, has yet to make a monumental mistake, and say that the minor issues were resolved or at the very least barely effective in the overall outcome of the campaign. However, with the flaws and holes in the system we have already experienced, there is bound to be many more mistakes, and it would be shocking to very few that some of those mistakes are catastrophic. We should remove the system of the Electoral College because it is questionable, problematic, and does not represent well our democracy.

The electoral College uses a group of people from each state, numbers varying from each, to represent voters in an election. The voters mark down a candidate on a ballot. However, they are actually voting for a group of strangers to represent them. Many voters do not even realize that this is the case. In politics, there are many powerful and influential people who will go to drastic measures to ensure that their ideas somehow make it to power. Bribes and incentives could easily be given to electors in attempts to sway their vote. Speaking of, these electors can be anyone who are not in a public office position, emphasis on the anyone. Voters can never really be sure that they can trust those strangers who they did not even get to select. Once the votes have been counted, voters cannot fully control who the electors actually vote for. There have been instances where electors have attempted to completely avert the votes cast and choose a different candidate that they want in office. It only seems logical that voters should have a direct say in the presidential election by participating in an election by popular vote. This way, there is less opportunity for scandal and confusion in the voting process.

In 1960, a group of segretationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing electors who supported John F. Kennedy with those who opposed him. If this had happened, all of the states electoral votes would have been cast by biased electors, rather than by the actual voters themselves. In the same year, Hawaii sent two state electors to congress instead of one. It is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issues like this arise. Along with issues with the electors, why is it that the size of a state automatically gives it a bigger advantage in elections? Texas and California are the most two saughtafter swing states in every election. Candidates will do everything they can to win over those electoral votes. But what about the little states? Many of the smaller states do not get visited by candidates. Some never even see campaign ads. This system we are using creates target areas in the United States that are more valuable in elections than others. This is in no way fair to the voters in smaller states, despite having the exact same rights as voters of bigger states. The Electoral College is proving to be less and less glamorous with every passing election. Slip ups like this can create a monumentally bad situation, and unfortunately, this system is only bound to create more.

Many people remember the problem of the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College had very effectively exemplified its flaws and unefficient ways of opperating. Al Gore and George Bush were running apposed, and despite winning the overall popular vote in the country, Gore lost the election to Bush. Bush had received the most electoral votes, therefore winning him the presidency. Basically, despite the fact that more citizens chose Gore to be president, Bush won out. In our constitution it is written that citizens of the United States have an unwavering right to vote and select who gets put into office. In this case, it sounds more like the number of electoral votes has an unwavering right to select who gets put into office. This goes against a democratic republic way of opperating our country and, in many ways, makes it more difficult for cititzens to take advantage of their rights.

For as many frustratingly resolvable problems that are created by the Electoral College, there are certain things about the Electoral College that could possibly make it worth keeping. For instance, there technically is no region of the country that has enough electoral votes to vote a president into office, so no one area of the controls large numbers of votes. Along with this, the system helps avoid RunOff Elections which complicate the election process and provide a clear winner. However, having a straightforward election where the votes come straight from citizens is most constitutional and much less problematic. The process has been used for a long time in our country, but it is time to make a change.

The Electoral College has proven to be more trouble than it's worth. Our country needs to decide what is within best interest for representation of our citizens, the most efficient way to opperate one of our most sacred constitutional rights, and maintain our democracy as members of our wonderful country. Remove the Electoral College system.",0,train_essays,,8
llama_70b_v1723,"Zoos are like super important for conservation and education and stuff. They help us learn about animals and their habitats and how to protect them. But some people think they're cruel and that we shouldn't keep animals in captivity. I think zoos are good because they help us learn about animals and how to take care of them.

First of all, zoos are like a safe place for animals. They provide a habitat for animals that are endangered or threatened in the wild. For example, zoos have helped to protect the giant panda, which is like super endangered. They also help to breed animals in captivity so that they can be released into the wild and help increase their populations. This is important because it helps to keep the animals from going extinct.

Another reason zoos are good is that they help us learn about animals. They provide a place for people to see animals up close and personal, which can help us appreciate them more. When we see animals in person, it makes us realize how important they are and how we need to protect them. Zoos also have educational programs and activities that teach us about animals and conservation. This can help us make informed decisions about how to protect animals and their habitats.

Zoos also help to support conservation efforts. Many zoos have conservation programs that help protect animals in the wild. For example, some zoos have programs that help protect marine life, like dolphins and sea turtles. These programs can help us learn about the animals and their habitats, and how to protect them from threats like pollution and overfishing.

However, some people think that zoos are cruel and that we shouldn't keep animals in captivity. They say that zoos are like prisons for animals and that they're not natural habitats. But, I think that zoos are like a necessary evil. They help us protect animals and learn about them, which is important for conservation. And, many zoos are working to improve their habitats and make them more natural for the animals. They're also working to reduce stress and improve the welfare of the animals.

In conclusion, zoos are important for conservation and education. They provide a safe place for animals, help us learn about them, and support conservation efforts. While some people may think that zoos are cruel, I think that they're necessary to help protect animals and their habitats. So, we should keep zoos open and continue to support them so that they can keep doing their important work.",1,llama_70b_v1,"The role of zoos in conservation and education has been a topic of debate.

Senitors

I Write to you about the Electional Colleges because, i beleive that it is fair to change it to which ever runner has the most votes will become president. I understand that each candidate running for prsident has his or her own group of electors chosen by the political party but it depends if they chose their electors respondsibly

Electoral College consists of 538 electors , but a majority of 270 votes are required to elect the president. Voters don't vote for the president they would have to vote for a a slate of democratic electors pledged to that person and if that person won they would go to congress and that runner would get that amount of electoral votes.

But if a tie happens the electrol vote would go to the house of representatives where they would have to decide who the president will be and senates would decide who the Vice President would be.

But in all my oppionion should be that who ever has the most popular vote will vbe prsedent.

Some activity may interest you but some don't. I think students should at least¬†be participate in one of the activity because participate in the activity help you learn more new thing, met new peoples, and more time to do something you like.

If you join or participate in any activity I think that will help you learn more. It can help you learn something you like or help you with your future career. Sometime your future career depend on what activity you do or what you learn from it. For example, if you join a sport team than maybe that can help you in the future if you want to be a sport player. You can also serve on the student council to help the school ready for the school event or activity that will help you learn new thing when you go around the school to check on what other class doing and you can learn from that also show your leadership.

Secondly, you can also met new friends during the activity. In some of the activity may required team work so you can met new friends. Sometime when you join the activity that you want but you dont have any friends there you can meet new people to be friends with. If you participate in the activity that will help you learn new thing from your new friends too. Meet new teacher who you not familiar with but they can help you at anytime as they can when you need them. You can also practice after school with friends for the activity.

EF8047505E53,"Sure thing! Here's my essay response:

Productivity and idleness are two concepts that have been debated for a long time. While being productive can lead to personal growth and success, being idle can hinder these aspects of life. In my opinion, being productive has a more significant impact on personal development and success than being idle.

Firstly, being productive allows individuals to develop new skills and knowledge. When we are productive, we are constantly learning new things, whether it's through work, hobbies, or personal projects. This learning can lead to personal growth and development, as we become more skilled and knowledgeable in various areas. In contrast, idleness can stagnate our growth, as we are not challenging ourselves or learning new things.

Secondly, productivity can lead to success in various aspects of life. When we are productive, we are more likely to achieve our goals and objectives. This can lead to success in our careers, relationships, and overall well-being. On the other hand, idleness can lead to a lack of motivation and direction, making it harder to achieve success.

Thirdly, being productive can improve our mental and physical health. When we are engaged in productive activities, we are more likely to feel fulfilled and satisfied with our lives. This can lead to better mental health, as we are less likely to experience stress and anxiety. Additionally, being productive can improve our physical health, as we are more likely to exercise and eat healthily when we are motivated to achieve our goals.

Finally, being productive can lead to a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment in life. When we are constantly challenging ourselves and achieving our goals, we are more likely to feel a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. This can lead to a more positive outlook on life and a greater sense of purpose.

In conclusion, while idleness can have its benefits, such as relaxation and leisure time, being productive has a more significant impact on personal development and success.

Mostly some students would love to do community service. Just show people how much awe they can show. I think it would be best for having volunteers to show up to do this kind of utilization.

This would help community be more of a clean place to be in if students are able to do community service in a plausible way. I would think that all students should not be forced to do this, but they should be offered to do it.

7E29ACA46157,"As an eighth-grade student, I have always found it interesting to compare the school systems of different countries. One aspect that has caught my attention is the length of summer breaks. In the United States, students typically have a two-month break during the summer, while in other countries, such as Japan and South Korea, students have only a one-month break.

Reducing the summer break can have negative effects on both students and their families. Firstly, students need time to rest and recharge after a long academic year. A longer break allows them to catch up on any missed sleep, spend time with friends and family, and pursue hobbies and interests outside of school. Additionally, a longer break can help students to avoid burnout and stress, which are common issues among students.

Furthermore, a shorter summer break can put a strain on families, particularly those with young children. Parents may struggle to find childcare during the summer, and children may miss out on important family time. Additionally, families may have to make sacrifices in order to afford summer activities and experiences, which can be stressful and difficult.

While a longer break may seem like the solution, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks. For example, a longer break could lead to a loss of academic momentum and a delay in starting the new school year. Additionally, some students may choose to use their summer break to work or take summer classes, which could be detrimental to their overall well-being.

Instead of focusing solely on the length of summer breaks, it may be more beneficial to consider how the school system can be changed to better incorporate the dreams and interests of students. For example, schools could offer more flexible scheduling options, such as alternative education paths or apprenticeships, that allow students to pursue their passions while still receiving an education. Additionally, schools could provide more resources and support for students who are struggling academically or emotionally, which could help to prevent burnout and stress.

In conclusion, while the length of summer breaks varies greatly between countries, it is important to consider the potential negative effects of reducing the break on students and their families. A longer break could be helpful in restoring students and allowing them to pursue their dreams, but it is important to balance this with the need for academic momentum and overall well-being. Ultimately, the school system should be changed to",1,llammistral7binstruct,,2
8DA298718DD7,"As an eighth-grade student, I have been attending school for the past eight years. While I have enjoyed my time at school, I have also encountered challenges that could have been easier to overcome if I had taken online classes instead. In this essay, I will explore the advantages of taking online classes and argue that they provide students with numerous benefits that are not available in traditional classroom settings.

Firstly, online classes are ideal for students who do not enjoy coming to school. Some students may feel uncomfortable in a traditional classroom setting, whether it's due to social anxiety or a lack of interest in the subject matter. Online classes provide a more flexible and personalized learning experience, allowing students to learn at their own pace and in their own time. This can be particularly beneficial for students who have difficulty concentrating in a traditional classroom setting.

Secondly, online classes offer students the opportunity to work at their own pace. Traditional classroom settings often have a set schedule, which means that students must keep up with the pace of their classmates. However, with online classes, students can work at their own pace, taking the time they need to fully understand the material. This can be particularly beneficial for students who require additional time to process information or who are struggling with a particular concept.

Thirdly, online classes allow students to finish their work anytime. This means that students can complete their assignments and coursework at a time that is convenient for them, whether it's early in the morning, late at night, or during the weekend. This can be particularly beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as sports or extracurricular activities.

Finally, online classes eliminate the need for snow days. Traditional classroom settings are often disrupted by snow days, which can cause students to miss important lessons and assignments. With online classes, however, students can continue to learn and complete their work from the comfort of their own home, even during inclement weather.

In conclusion, online classes provide students with numerous benefits that are not available in traditional classroom settings. They are ideal for students who do not enjoy coming to school, offer students the opportunity to work at their own pace, allow students to finish their work anytime, and eliminate the need for snow days. As such, I believe that students benefit from taking classes online and that this form of education should be more widely available.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,2
F6CFA4C7247B,"Have you ever seen something that looked like a extra terestrial sight like crop circles, well NASA's Viking 1 saw something that looked like an egyptian face while circling Mars looking for a place for its sister ship (Viking 2).

In 1976, a photo of what was though to be a Ancient Egyptian Face turned out to be a hoax (unintentionally) and was actually just a Land formation with inclined rocks that formed a Shadow that conveyed illusions of two eyes a nose and a mouth. At first this was a very succesful and popular image, a section from the article states that "" The Face On Mars has becoma a pop icon, that starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk show and even haunted stores for 25 years"". this states that this photo was a clear sign of Extarestrial life, at least at the time.

Although many people beleived this theory was a Alien artifact it was eventually disproven on April 5, 1998 as shown on the article ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"".

Allthough many people still believe that scientists must have missed something and that it really is a allien artifact sorry to burtst your bubble but, you are wrong. See Scientists have been working on this theory for very many years they have gone back and looked at it multiple times, retaken pictures from multiple different angles, Enlarged x3 and still the only thing there is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa.

On april 8, 2001 a Mars Global surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They then rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 156 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1978 Viking photo"".

So from all of the information from this article it is confirmed that ""The Face"" isn't really a extraterestrial artifact, but just a measly illusion.  ",0,persuade_corpus,,4
falcon_180b_v1_288,"Dear Principal,

I am writing to share my thoughts on the possible policy change that would require students to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. While I understand the importance of academic success, I believe that this policy change may not be the best solution.

On one hand, I can see how this policy change may motivate some students to improve their grades. If they know that their participation in sports or other activities is dependent on their academic performance, they may be more inclined to work harder and study more. This could lead to better grades and a stronger academic foundation.

However, on the other hand, I believe that this policy change may have unintended consequences. For example, some students may be discouraged from participating in sports or other activities altogether if they feel that they cannot meet the grade B requirement. This could lead to decreased participation and less engagement in school activities, which could ultimately harm the school community.

Additionally, some students may have extenuating circumstances that make it difficult for them to achieve a grade B average. For example, they may have a learning disability or a challenging home life that affects their academic performance. Punishing them by not allowing them to participate in sports or other activities may not be fair or helpful.

Instead of requiring a grade B average, I suggest that the school consider alternative solutions to encourage academic success. For example, the school could offer tutoring or study groups to help students improve their grades. Additionally, the school could offer incentives for academic success, such as recognition or prizes, rather than punishment for those who do not meet a certain standard.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this issue. I hope that my arguments have been helpful in your decision-making process.

Sincerely,

falcon_180b_v1_635,"I firmly believe that arts education is essential for a well-rounded education. It provides students with opportunities to develop their creativity, critical thinking, and communication skills, which are crucial for success in any field.

Firstly, arts education fosters creativity and self-expression. It allows students to explore their interests and passions while encouraging them to think outside of the box. For example, through visual arts, students can experiment with different materials and techniques to create unique works of art. Similarly, in music and theatre, they can express themselves through performance and composition. These experiences not only cultivate creativity but also boost students' confidence and self-esteem.

Secondly, arts education promotes critical thinking skills. By analyzing and interpreting works of art, students learn to make connections between seemingly unrelated ideas and concepts. They also develop the ability to evaluate and critique their own work as well as that of others. For instance, when studying literature, students must analyze the author's use of language, symbolism, and themes to understand the deeper meaning of the text. This process fosters critical thinking skills that are valuable in all aspects of life.

Lastly, arts education enhances communication skills. Through collaboration and presentation, students learn to articulate their ideas effectively and engage with others. For example, in drama classes, students must work together to stage a production, requiring clear communication and teamwork. Similarly, in visual arts, students often present their work to the class, learning to explain their artistic choices and receive feedback from peers. These experiences help students develop strong communication skills that will benefit them throughout their academic and professional careers.

In conclusion, arts education is not just an optional extra but an essential component of a well-rounded education. It provides students with opportunities to develop their creativity, critical thinking, and communication skills, all of which are vital for success in any field. Therefore, schools should prioritize arts education and ensure that all students have access to quality programs in visual arts, music, theatre, and literature.",1,falcon_180b_v1,"Many people believe that arts education is essential for a well-rounded education, while others think that it should be optional.

883880ACBA01,"People ask other people for advice for many reasons, they are important but, in order to make the right decision, they need time, opinions of others, and they need to, at the end, think it over and see ho it can affect their future.

People ask other people for advice and opinions to make choices, but why? there are many answers, but many people ask because they want to make the right decision or decisions¬†based on other opinions made by other people, or they want to see if the advice or opinions make sense and see if the opinions of others are related to each other. and most important of all, the person who is making the decision should see how the decision would make a difference in their future.

First, time is vital because, the more time you have, you would make the better choice at the end and this can also lead to having more decisions too. for example, lets say that you had a choice of where you would go for college. You would ask other people who have gone to the college, because you want to see what they had to say about it. If you take time to ask them, then you would make a better decision at the end.

another reason why time is important is that, if you do not rush through the decision making process, you would have a lower chance of making mistakes. Time can also help with the factor of not rushing because if you rush, usually you can not take it back even if make a good or bad decision. This leads to a couple of things that you can miss if you rush. lastly you would also have to think things over because once you see a better decision¬†you usually can not take that back either because you have made the choice.

Next, logic is also important for asking advice and opinions from other people, since you can not just go off what you want, because that also would not help you most of the time. you can also tell why other people made their opinion(s), and many other people have logic in their opinions too. To state the obvious¬†you can not make good decisions with a opinions that are outrageous, since they can not help you. logic also requires some common knowledge to make the decision, because you will need common knowledge to separate logical opinions from the ones that are not. Thinking is also tied in to logic too, because some logic does not come naturally to most people, because you have to take the time to think and see if the opinion is logical or not. If it is not, than do not choose it, but if it is, then you can keep that opinion in mind.

when you reach a point where you can not go any farther on gathering advice, it is important to look over the advice and opinions, because you could have missed something but, the most important hing is to predict what could happen in the future.

you should plan out what can happen in the future and you should ask you self ""why does this person have this opinion?"" after you ask you self that you should see how the advice of that person can affect you and see why it good to ask a lot of people. At the end it is good for you to ask other people, because they can also lead you to the best decision, if you ask many people. This can eventually also make you think if the advice from other people is helpful or not to making the best decision. looking over things is also good because, you can tie in all of the logical opinions and advice from others into whole summary, and this can help you conclude what most of the advice and opinions¬†agreed on.

In conclusion, advice from many people is better than just having advice from just one person, because you can have more time to think about it and this can lead to more choices, secondly asking more people for advice and opinions can also help with seeing which opinions make sense and which ones do not and finally if you ask more people, you can look over which opinions are the best. this can also help with the final decision making process, this helps because you can now predict how the advice of others can affect you outcome.",0,persuade_corpus,,2

I believe in both sides of your decision, because there are many different reasons why students should be able to and shouldn't be able to participate in sports with a B average. I support your decision, in that I believe that academics come before sports. I also don't support your decision, because sports are good for students and they help them stay active and fit.

Having said that these are some more detailed reasons why they shouldn't participate in sports with a B average. I believe that school should come before sports, plus the students already have P.E. as a class to help them stay fit. I think that school is what students are graded on and that sports are just for fun. I also believe that academics are what help move your life forward, whether it is to college or medical school or even law school. I believe that education is an important piece of your life, and if you don't have an education, you can't fulfill the simplest of tasks, like shopping at a grocery store.

Though, on the other hand these are some specific reasons why they should be able to participate in sports without a B average. I think that students should have the choice to stay fit, without having to go out of their way to find a different sport to do to stay fit. For some students P.E. isn't enough to keep them fit, sometimes students need more than just a class period devoted to staying fit to be fit. I also believe that it is hard for some students to make their grade because a grade C average is average, and not all students are able to understand some concepts learned in school enough to pass to a grade B average.

For the few students who are extra hyper, they may not be able to concentrate on school long enough to actually get a B average. They might need sports to let out some of their energy, so that they can calm down during class and hype up during sports, it might allow other students to be able to concentrate on their school work instead of being distracted by someone else who isn't able to concentrate on school because of a disorder or an excess of energy.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Have you ever done something stupid? Well, if you got someone else's opinion before you did it, would you have done it? Seeking others opinion before doing something is helpful because you get many different view points and reduces the chances of risk.

First, everyone has many different experiences,that means we all can have different view points. Having different¬†view points can help you make wise and profound dissensions. People often need help with school assignment. Asking for others view points on a project or homework can help someone do better on it and get a better grade. Another example is sports, getting someone else's opinion can help improve your playing style and skill level. Also, when get more then one view point, you are more likely to do the right thing. For example, if someone is doing something questionable, someone who has done it or seen the consequences of doing it, can attempt to stop them.

Secondly, if you ask for others opinions before you act, you reduce the chances of risk. While yes, risk can sometimes be a good thing, it can also be a bad thing. For example, someone is trying to jump off the roof of their house to impress their friends. If someone doesn't tell them to stop they may hurt themselves or others. Another, less stress educing example is, someone wants to use profanity in their English paper for excitement. If someone tell them to stop, the risk of getting in trouble is greatly decreased or goes away altogether. It it always best to recuse stress.

In conclusion, ask for others opinions. Everyone makes mistakes and its okay but It is extremely helpful to ask for your peers opinion because it can help reduce risk and you can get many different view points.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

6EF7CBB46501,"Title: The Importance of Following One's Heart in Pursuit of Success

As an 8th grader, I have often pondered the question of what it takes to be successful in the world. While some people believe that success requires following the crowd and doing what others do, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, success comes from listening to one's heart and pursuing one's passions, regardless of what others might say.

One example that comes to mind is my friend Sarah, who was pressured by her parents to become a doctor. She had always been interested in science and medicine, but as she grew older, she realized that her true passion lay in art. Despite her parents' disapproval, Sarah decided to pursue her artistic talents and is now studying graphic design in college. Her decision to follow her heart has led to her being happier and more fulfilled in her career than she would have been had she followed the path her parents wanted her to take.

It is important to make decisions using one's heart rather than relying on what others might say because it allows individuals to be true to themselves. When people do what they love, they are more likely to be motivated and dedicated to their work, which can lead to greater success in the long run. On the other hand, when people are influenced by others, they may end up in a career that they do not truly enjoy, leading to a lack of fulfillment and dissatisfaction.

While failure and making mistakes can be scary, they are also essential for growth and understanding what it takes to be successful. When people take risks and try new things, they learn from their mistakes and become better versions of themselves. For instance, if Sarah had not taken the risk of pursuing her passion for art, she may have never discovered her true talents and potential.

Finally, the benefits of following one's heart are numerous. Not only does it lead to greater happiness and fulfillment, but it also allows individuals to make a meaningful impact in the world. When people do what they love, they are more likely to be motivated to make a difference in their communities and in the lives of others.

In conclusion, while following the crowd may seem like the easy way to success, I believe that it is important to listen to one's",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

I think you should let us students have our cell phones out during free time and during lunch. The reason I chose Policy 1 is because if we wanted our mom or dad to bring our lunch to school we could just call or text them on our phones instead of going to the office to call them. Another reason why is because if were in class and we are finish with our work we should be able to play games or listen to music on our phones but if we get to listen to music, we have to keep it down so no-one else could hear it or distract them out of their work. But once we go back to class from lunch or free time we should have our phones off until out teacher tells us we could listen to music or play games if they let us do so. I also think if the student is making bad grades they shouldn't be able to get on their phones at all during school hours!

Every day in the United States around one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers, and around 1500 are injured in some way in crashes by these irresponsible, distracted drivers. One of the most dangerous, distracting activities that many people do is texting while driving. It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose the control of the vehicle, and could cause a crash or even in a worst-case could kill other people. When a person is texting, she/he is thinking about other things besides concentrating on driving. This is very dangerous because it could make the driver lose control of the car and slow her/his brain's reaction time in case of a potential accident.

For this reason, it is very important that we find some ideas to break off this bad habit of texting while driving. I think that one of the easiest and best ways to break this habit is simply to turn off your phone. In this case, the driver wouldn't be distracted by the ringing or buzzing of the phone, and it wouldn't tempt the driver to text while driving. Another way to break this habit is to download some of the new applications that can disable cell phones while people are driving. Also, there are other applications that automatically send a text to whoever is texting the driver to tell that person that she/he is driving and that the text will be answered later. There are a great variety of applications to choose I think that we can use these to help us with the problem of texting while we are driving. Additionally, if a driver is waiting for an important call or text and has company in the car, the phone can be given to a passenger to check it out. Also, there are some programs that are helping to raise awareness about the dangers of distracted driving and to keep it from occurring. In these anti-texting programs, people can drive in a simulated situation, where they are driving but also texting, and can see how many accidents are caused by this problem. In fact, in 2011, at least 23% of auto collisions involved cell phones. That's about 1.3 million crashes! Not only that but texting while driving is actually more dangerous than driving while being drunk or high on marijuana. Every year almost a million people in the United States get into accidents, the majority: teens. Unfortunately, the number just keeps increasing.

Though texting and driving caused many injuries and deaths, there are still people who don't think it's a problem and are confident that they can use their phone and drive simultaneously. However, 34% of teens aged sixteen to seventeen spend about 10% of their driving time outside of their lane. This affects other people who are driving and can cause the deaths of innocent lives. In a 2012 Cell Phone and Driving Statistic, it is reported that 3,328 people were killed and 421,000 people were injured due to distracted drivers. Furthermore, it is said that talking or listening on the phone increases the risk of crashing by 1.3 times while reaching for a device is 1.4. Dialing is 2.8 times more risk of crashing while texting is 23 more times. Additionally, talking on a cell phone and driving at the same time can make the driver's reaction time to be as slow as that of a seventy-year-old. To break these habits, people can either turn off their phone or put it on silent before driving. This will force them to concentrate on the road only. But if this method doesn't work on some people, you can use S voice or Siri to command your phone to read out your messages or to reply back. This will allow your eyes to focus on the road instead of your phone. No more reaching for your phone to text ""Lol"" or ""Lmao"" and endangering your own live and many others. Though you are still talking while driving, it still decreases your chance of crashing. An app in smart phones that works similarly to the method I described before is called DriveSafe. ly. Basically, it reads your text messages and emails out loud and has a customization auto-responded.

In conclusion using your phone while driving can cause/ lead you or others to bad injuries maybe death. To stop people from texting and driving, one of the major phone companies, AT&T, address this problem by creating the AT&T's It Can Wait to text and driving campaign to spread awareness. Many stories and documentaries are also posted online to support this campaign. You can also join millions of others who have signed the pledge to never text and drive and to instead take action to educate others about the dangers of it. If you still believe you can get home safely by texting and driving, AT&T's simulator will prove you wrong. It gives you a real-life experience of texting and driving. With this game, you'll only find out that it's not as easy as it sounds. Before you look at a text, remember that it is not worth dying for. But preventing the usage of these everyday devices is very simple, yet rather difficult, and will save lives if it work out. Accidents are deadly to many people, so creating an environment for everyone is better in the long run. As a young adult, I plan to use some of these ideas and promote these websites and encourage others around me to do the same.       ",0,persuade_corpus,,7
9a85011d,"The Electoral College is a system that should no longer be used because it is based on an outdated system from the first years of our country's independence. It would be much more beneficial to use the popular vote as the final vote. One reason is that one candidate can get more votes, but still lose the election! Another is that many states never get to see the potential president speak, as to make their descion. Lastly voting would be easier to count and to understand for citizens and those who work the election.

In 2000, the electoral college failed to properly represent our country's people. More people voted for Al Gore, but Bush still won the election. In the states where Bush did win, it made the people who voted for Al Gore insignificant and their votes would never again be considered. Even if in every state a particular candidate won by one vote, that person would still get every electoral vote, because they won the state, this is mostly an issue in large states. This is unfair to the losing candidate because their voters never really got a chance. If it was a popular vote, voting would be much more direct and easier to understand. Citizens might even be unaware that they aren't really voting for the president, they are voting for their electoral college representative. With popular vote, there would be no more confusion, and no more worrying about comparing the two voting methods.

Another reason is that some states may never get a chance to see their potential president speak. Potential presidents tend to go speak in swing states, or states that may vote either for them or for their opponent, since it is based on the states vote not the individual people. When a president goes to speak in a swing state they are convincing people that it will be a better choice to vote for them, not the other candidate. If somebody lived in Rhode Island, for example, they would never get the chance to see their potential president speak, therefore they would have to make their descion based on television speeches, newspaper articles, etc.

Also states that tend to vote one way or another often do not get visited because there is no point in trying to convince a state to vote for you that is definitley already going to vote you, to vote for you, and vice versa. Swing states with high populations are really the only states that are visited. It is no promise that the potential president will go to every state or even every region, but they will more likely than not visit different states than they would have before. If popular vote decided who would become president, it likely would no longer be true for presidents to only visit swing states.

Last, the entire election process would be much more simplistic. There would be a whole group of people who no longer would have to be a part of the process, and the less people, the less mistakes. Also each state could still add up their votes, then add all the state's votes together and voila, the president has been chosen, by the people. There would be no more arguments as to who really won the election, as in popular vote versus electoral college. Also there would be much less of a chance for a tie, the more numbers the less each number is worth. Overall, the electoral college adds unecessary complications to a potentially simple system.

The popular voting system would still be difficult to take care of, but much better than the previous system, the despised electoral college. Throughout the years we have seen twice where our course of history could have been radically changed, with a different president. The popular vote system would increase the power of the people, allow more people to see the president speak, and get rid of unecessary complications and confusion of the electoral college.",0,train_essays,,0

99F6C8027D43,"When I think about owning a car that can drive itself it blows my mind. Never in a million years would I think that in my lifetime, this could be possible. Many people believe that driverless cars are a wonderful, innovative idea. On the other side some people believe that driverless cars could be dangerous. I favor driverless cars in most aspects, but it would be foolish to think one-sided.

There are many benefits of driverless cars. For me specifically, sometimes I find it hard to get rides to go places. With a driverless car I could go anywhere at anytime. In my family we are very busy, sometimes at different places at the same time. Sometimes I have rehearsal and my brother has wrestling practice while my parents are both at work. We do a lot of carpooling. With driverless cars it would be a lot easier.

There are some benefits but there are also some negatives of driverless cars. Even though the companies manufacturing these so called driverless cars have made sure they have every safety measure in place there are still somethings even they can't control. Weather can sometimes play a big role in how a car drives. Wind and rain can effect your driving and sometimes even eathrquakes and tornadoes strike when you are driving. Eventually they may produce a tool that could combat this but as of right now I don't know how we can get over this obstacle. Machines may react faster and smarter than humans but there will always a small fraction of accidents caused by animals or pedestrians in the road. I don't think we should take for granted this improvement though. Look at it like this, machines may not be perfect but they are certainly better than humans. Humans don't react as quickly. Think about drunk drivers, the amount of accidents caused by drunk would most likely be exponentially decreased.

With driverless cars I think our roads would be significantly safer. Although driverless cars are still a work in progress I think we have made a huge improvement to our safety. If this goes through to the next stage I wouldn't be suprised if we saw less death due to car accidents. That is my position on driverless cars.",0,persuade_corpus,,6
EB67209E0468,"I have found that the key to increasing success in life is to take small steps that lead to long-term growth. From my personal experience, I have identified three steps which, when followed consistently, have contributed to my own successes: 1) setting meaningful goals, 2) soldiering on even when facing setbacks, and 3) creating new opportunities. 

When it comes to setting goals, you should identify measurable objectives that are within reach yet still challenging. By setting achievable goals, you will cultivate a feeling of accomplishment which will increase your motivation and result in further successes.

No matter how well you plan, setbacks are always a part of life. When confronted with difficulties, we should persist by utilizing the resources and knowledge at our disposal. Taking the time to problem solve and maintaining high spirits can be key in ultimately overcoming obstacles and achieving desired goals.

Lastly, it is important to always be on the lookout for new opportunities. Whether it is a job offer, a hobby that sparks your interest, or a mentor to gain important new perspectives, learning new things can open doors that weren‚Äôt previously available and provide a much-needed break from daily routines. Taking action and actively pursuing new opportunities can be a significant catalyst to increased success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,Task: Identify and outline steps that lead to increased success in life.

864E45D7BD5B,"Do you agree or disagree with the fact that our principle has decided that its a must to participate in extracurricular activities? I disagree because students should have a choice, some students do not have the time to participate in activities for certain reasons, and some students just don't like to be apart of extracurricular activities.

First, I disagree because students should have a choice if they want to be apart of after school activities. Students should not be forced to do be apart of any extracurricular activities. If they do not want to apart they do not have to because students can make decisions for their selves.

Next, I disagree because some students do not have the time to be apart of any after school activities. Some students do not have time to stay after school everyday. Some students have jobs. Some students might have things planned with friends and family. Students have more important things to do.

Finally, I disagree because some students just don't enjoy being apart of after school activities. Some students just want to go home, sleep, and watch TV. Some students hate after school activities because they have to stay back after school. Some students even hate the thought of having to stay back after school hours.

In conclusion, I think that all students should have a choice because some students cannot stay back after school for certain reasons, some students don't have the time to say back after school, and some students just don't want to stay back after school.   ¬† ¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,5

United States is consider the country were more fast food is distributed and consumed, and also where more people die because of their high cholesterol.

Now a days with all the technologies advantages people is doing less exercise and moving less , for example: We use the car to go everywhere so we walk less ; we do not even need to walk to talk to a person , we can just send them a text ; even to see the weather outside we do not need to stand up ,we can just check the weather in our phone; we have got to a point where if we are to lazy to go to the cinema we can just stay home and watch Netflix,Hulu, Disney or any phone app.

All this is great but at the same time is making lazy people more lazy and more fat , witch is causing more medical problems; like hart attacks , high cholesterol.

In a future if we do not change anything this it will get worse.

A way of helping the future kids like the students from this school would be by teaching them that there is more than fast food , that there is also healthy food that can taste awesome and some even better than the unhealthy food, for example: avocado, fruit juice ,Cesar salad, fish,etc. That all this types of food can create a balance between eating what your body need to work correctly , and what it want to eat.

One way of showing them other variety of food , is by the school menu. The menu could contain food that the kids have never taste before , and that could have less fat than a pizza.

This way when they get older they will not only look for , hamburgers , Chinese food or chicken wings. They will know there are more options that could help them with their body.

And if we do not teach them this habit right now it will be a lot more hard to get them in the healthy habit in the future.

In my opinion considering being part of the school community and thinking about my future and my classmates

I think that including a more healthy menu in the school cafeteria would be one of the best ideas for everyone. We do not want to have any medical problems because of the food we eat.

81F8C7B45A58,"Do you think you will make a better choice when seeking opinions from other people? I believe so. I think that asking multiple people will help you make a better choice because you can get more opinions, receive feedback, and come up with a better idea.

By asking more people, you get more opinions. If you are stuck on a decision and don't know what to do, ask people to help you make the decision. With more opinions you can look at all the different views of the decision and decide what is best. Sometimes people make decisions on just their opinion, but other times it is in your best interest to ask other people because they could have a better opinion or judgment on the topic or issue. One time I was doing my homework and I did not understand how to do it. I asked my parents for some advice on how to do my homework and with their advice, I was able to understand the homework.

Receiving feedback is important¬†when it comes to advice and opinions. When asking lots of people for feedback, they can give you some suggestions and tips about what to improve on for whatever you are doing. It helps you build on what you already have and make it better. Once I was doing a really important project for a class and went in during resource to ask the teacher for feedback about what I could improve on in the project. I got some feedback on what to improve and did it. I got a better grade on the project after I changed it then what I would of gotten before. Feedback on something can also help for future opportunities. Those are the reasons why I think receiving feedback is important and helpful.

When doing something, having the best idea is always good, but you can't always come up with that on your own. If you have multiple people trying to come up with a solution, you can combine their ideas to come up with the best idea/opinion. There is also more creativity and brainpower put together when you have lots of people working to try and come up with the best idea. In school, one of the reasons why teachers do group projects is to try and get multiple people working together to come up with a really good idea or solution. Multiple people working together is how you get the best idea or solution for whatever it is you are doing.

I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. I think that because you can gather more opinions, receive feedback, and come up with a better idea. You should ask other people for help before you make a decision on your own.",0,persuade_corpus,,3
EB8030177678,"As Thomas Jefferson said ""Determine never to be idle ... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I believe that Thomas Jefferson's quote is right because if people determine to never be idle, they can accomplish more than those who determine to be idle. Although some says that determine to be idle or inactivity also serve a purpose because they can accomplish something with the time or when people make a purpose to don't be idle, actually Determine never to be idle is much better because we accomplish more if we are doing something people can make proud their family and people may growth having a better future.

Although some says that determine to be idle or inactivity also serve a purpose in the way of one day they will accomplish something even though they are lazy, and people determine to not be idle when they want to accomplish something and when people decide to not being wasting their time without doing anything, inactivity doesn't serve a purpose in the life and in the way of accomplish something

Determine never to be idle is much better because we accomplish more, we make proud our family when we do something great to our life, I have done many things in school and accomplish many goals in my life so my parents always tell me that I make them feel proud of me for all that I have been done even though they said that it is not that easy but they know that I never determine to be idle and I always like to accomplish something in my life.

I always like to accomplish things like having a better grades in school and learn more each day even though some classes are harder than other once but I like to not be idle because if I determine to be idle I may just waste my time doing nothing.

Determine never to be idle is much better because people can growth having a better future in their life,

people can growth having a better job. For example, I want to growth by studying a career and have a better job in the future.

B23BDDB4B5FA,"Community Service??

Dear principle,

I would like to help in the community service group. I think it is very important for us as student's to help in the community service. It is important because we need to show that we care for our community and world. Some people say that it is a waist of time to be helping the community and the world they think that that's why their are people to work and take the trash out and stuff like that. But we cant leave other people that work all day and all week when they are tiered and want to rest to be picking our left overs!! Some people are eating at the park, mall, store, etc. and they think that when they are eating they could just through their rappers and some food on the ground and not pick it up they live it their so others can pick it up for them and i think that is WRONG!!! The people that have food, drinks, etc. and are eating any were they should throw their trash in the trash can's when they are done eating their food. And i think if we pass by trash being in the floor we should pick it up because to be honest i don't think another person would pick it up but they should. We don't want our community/world to be dirty and stinky with trash all over the place. We want our world to be clean and with nice fresh air that we could breathe with NO problem. That's why i want to join in the community service group to help our community /world be a better place for other people and us even if others don't want to help but i think that every one should be in the community service group and help the community. Well this is what i think dear principle and i hope you like my letter!!!

DBCC1F8F92B5,"Talking with more than one person can make decisions have a more clear best choice. Seeking advice from multiple people allows for learning from others' experiences, more inclusive actions, and different perspectives on issues. These all help a person make the best decision, and lead to the most prosperity.

It can be difficult to work through tough decisions on your own, so asking others who have gone through similar circumstances can help cause a better outcome.¬†When I was deciding whether I should apply to Awesome Math Summer Program, a prestigious math overnight camp at Cornell University, I was debating if this would be a worthwhile experience for me. It would have been the first ever time I stayed away from home by myself, and I was nervous I wouldn't make any friends. The camp was also highly priced, and I didn't want to put financial burden on my parents, who were already paying for my brother's expensive private college. However, Awesome Math Summer Program is known for the classes it offers, all of which would greatly benefit me as a competitive math student. Many of the courses there were perfect for my math level, and would provide a challenge I wasn't getting in normal school math. Many of my friends said it was a great experience, but I didn't know if they were providing me the whole truth on what the camp was like. I was very conflicted on what my plan of action should be, so I turned to another person who I knew had past experience and could guide me through my decision making. My brother had already attended Awesome Math Summer Program a few years back, and he said although it wasn't suited for his style of learning, it would be a great fit for me. The lessons were more problem solving based, which was my favorite type of class. His knowledge of the program allowed me to make the best decision regarding my application to Awesome Math Summer Program, which in the end I did apply and get accepted to. My brother's advice from his own personal experiences gave me a look into a camp I wouldn't have had otherwise, and allowed me to have one of the best summers of my life. His and others' advice played a large role in me attending this program, and also have made me more including of others.

One of the biggest flaws I have is that it is extremely difficult for me to focus on what others need over my own needs. It can be hard to know how to include everyone so they benefit from my actions, as well as make sure no one is being left out. However, I find I am more inclusive when I know what multiple individuals need to succeed. In sixth grade, I was student council president of my school, and one of the topics many students wanted me to address was on bullying. I didn't know how exactly I could help students going through this horrible ordeal, because many victims of bullying don't like to stand up for fear of more shame. When I consulted with teachers, students, and my parents, they all had an overarching idea of focusing on kindness and the prevention of bullying, instead of bullying itself. This was something I never thought of before and never would have been able to think of, but with the aid of many others, I was able to form a new idea for approaching bullying in my school. I established a wristband kindness program, where wristbands were given out to students who were seen doing kind acts, such as helping another student without being asked or holding the door open at recess. When those students saw another student doing a thoughtful deed, they would pass on the bracelet and continue the spread of kindness. This motivated many young children to become more generous and understanding, a trait that will take them far in life. This idea wouldn't have even have been possible if it weren't for all the kids and teachers that helped me decide what I should focus on as student council president, as well as giving me the ideas for the project. I was able to develop a more inclusive program from multiple opinions, which also helps provide different viewpoints in conflicts.

The judicial branch has the complicated job of making some of the most difficult decisions in our country. During the Supreme Court case of Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeir, the justices had to decide if school officials could censor the school newspaper, or if this was violation of First Amendment Rights. They worked together to deliberate the most Constitutionally fair outcome, and formed the majority opinion based off of what most justices thought was the best ruling. Each justice was able to provide their own perspective on the issue, which is especially important for court cases since everyone has different ideas on what is fair. In the end, they ruled the First Amendment did not prohibit schools from censoring the school newspaper. They were able to reach this ruling from countless hours spent in debate of the conflict, and make a fair decision based off of everyone's unique perspective. The opinions from multiple individuals help make the most just decision in a court case, as well as help decision making in real life.

Most decisions do not require much in-depth analyzing, but there are some can be very hard and draining to make. No matter how exhausting this can be though, there are always methods to make decision making more bearbale. One way to make this easier is to seek the advice of more than one person, as this can lead to the best choice. Others who have already been through what you are going to can give helpful advice, as well as make more inclusive decisions and give a different view on issues. From this, a person can take the best and most fair actions to help them succeed.",0,persuade_corpus,,8

Being on your device and driving could be an overly dangerous choice in life. Many people around the world are injured by this situation every day. It could lead to accidents and altercations. In addition it would even cost you your licences. The most detrimental outcome is death. There are far more outcomes to operating a motor vehicle while being on a cell phone. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.

One leading cause to motor vehicle accidents is being on your cell phone. It could lead to accidents and altercations. Yourself and the passengers are more at risk to bodily injuries and harm. These bodily injuries and harm can range anywhere from mild to critical condition. In an motor vehicle accident there is more than one involved. There is another person or group of people that could have the exact same conditions than the driver on the cell phone. In an example of an altercations you could be more prone to damaging an building or such. An direct result of an event in place; a fee or very large payment would need to be made. Secondly another consequence could be having your license taken.

When you have violated a driving law there will always be an consequence. Rather it being jail time, injuries, or more. Your license will be subjected to suspension. A suspended license defines as you are not able to drive until they are reinstated. The process can take anywhere from a short period of time or even a long period of time. The average time for a suspended license is sixty days.

For some people if it is not your first offense they may even take your license for good. Furthermore there is another cause to driving while being on your cell phone.

After all the consequences the most detrimental is death. Many people happen to pass away due to a motor vehicle car accident. Not all people pass away at the crash site, some has a condition mild to critical that causes them to die. Around 1.6 million people a year die in motor vehicle accidents. Out of the 1.6 million, 1 out of 4 pass away because drivers are on their cell phone. That includes the driver and the unlucky few that may have been in the car, around, or in another car. Passing away from a motor vehicle accident can be prevented by simply waiting until you have reached a stopping point or your at your destination to pick up your phone.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. It can cause accidents and altercations, suspension of license, and even death. Prevention is simply not being able to use your phone while operating a motor vehicle. Take a moment to focus on the road.

You are able to check your phone when you reach a red light or a complete stop. This is one step closer to its prevention. It will save many lives even your own.   ",0,persuade_corpus,,3
C2F932159FF8,"The way the author supported his claims were ways of providing examples. He defined his examples in a way to make worth of pursuiting Venus despite its dangers. He did this by comparing them to the actual project of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus.""

First off, he explains that Venus is our neighboring planet. Despite of Venus being close to Earth; we don't know much about it. However, later in the article he mentions something interesting that catches most people's eye. He mentions, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This caught my eye, especially, because it goes with the idea of Venus being an interesting and worthy pursuit to discover and learn from. Despite of Venus having no life and probably not worth to look at. But all of that changes when he states how the conditions actually are.

Furthermore, as said in the question, despite all of the dangers, it will be worth to study Venus. Since we'll be able to know what actually happened long ago. In paragraph three the author states, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus,"" also he states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" These are the dangers of Venus. When considering to send some sort of probe or satellite to investigate this planet these are the circumstances we must consider. The way he incoorperates this idea fully just shows how incredible and extreme these conditions are, to even try and land a rover on Venus.

Lastly, in paragraph five the author starts explaining ways to study and investigate Venus without having to worry about its weather extremes. The author explains, ""A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" He shows us that it has even more worth to study Venus. We are now able to study Venus but at a different angle. This ties in with his idea of pursuiting Venus because we have the chance to find out more about it. Even though it is not the best insight of Venus, gives a perfect example that every little detail we learn about Venus is important and nteresting.

Tying all his claims together, he shows us that Venus is worth the danger to pursuit the planet. The way he compared and contrasted with each detail supports his claim strongly. As the author states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humas."" Meaning it is not going to be easy, but it is definitely possible.",0,persuade_corpus,,9

Hello, I have notice you are thinking about requiring all students to perform community service. Some might agree with you because our community needs to be taking care of. On the other hand, others might degree because they believe community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. I would like to tell you why i believe that you should be required to perform community service.

Some agree that the community service is needed because we need to take care of our community.

It is very important to take care of the community. If we don't then our community would have litter all over the ground, elementary children need help and if we are not willing to help them then not good grades would be on their report cards. We don't have a lot of people helping in our community services so we need more helpers but the people we do have doesn't regret helping out and serving their job.

Other students however, believes that community service takes too much time away from things they want and need to do. Now a lot of students play sports and homework and etc. but maybe on days that they don't have anything to do or they have extra time they can service the community. Only if it is only an hour at the soup kitchen, I'm sure they wouldn't mind helping out even if it isn't a lot of time.

I believe that students should be required to perform community service because we need to clean up on community and help out. It doesn't matter if it is just an hour or if it is five hours, students need to learn to help out with the surroundings around us. I strongly believe that students need to be required because they will see the fun and great feeling of taking care of the community.

Thank you for taking your time and reading this letter. I hope you understand my thoughts about your decision.

66288718AF60,"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Making important life decisions can be super tough, you know? Like, which college should I go to? Or what career path should I choose? It's not easy to make the right choice, especially when there are so many options to choose from. That's why it's important to seek advice from other people. But, should you get advice from one person or multiple people? That's the question.

Pros of seeking advice from one person:

* It's easier to focus on one person's opinion. When you're getting advice from one person, you can really focus on what they're saying and what they think. You don't have to worry about hearing conflicting opinions from multiple people.
* You can get more personalized advice. When you're getting advice from one person, they can really get to know you and your situation. They can give you advice that's tailored to you and your specific needs.

Cons of seeking advice from one person:

* You might miss out on other perspectives. When you're only getting advice from one person, you might be missing out on other perspectives that could be really helpful. It's important to hear from a variety of people to get a well-rounded view of the situation.
* You might be influenced by bias. One person's opinion might be biased towards something that's not actually the best choice for you. It's important to get advice from a variety of people to avoid being swayed by bias.

Pros of seeking advice from multiple people:

* You get a variety of perspectives. When you're getting advice from multiple people, you're getting a variety of perspectives on the situation. This can help you make a more informed decision because you're not relying on just one person's opinion.
* You can avoid bias. When you're getting advice from multiple people, you're less likely to be influenced by bias. You're getting a more well-rounded view of the situation, which can help you make a better decision.

For me, it was this one time when I was like, 8 years old. I was at my grandma's house and I accidentally knocked over a vase. It was this really old, like, antique vase that she had been passing down for generations. And I was so embarrassed. I felt like the worst person in the world. My grandma was really upset too, but she didn't yell at me or anything. She just kinda sighed and said, ""Accidents happen."" But I could tell she was still upset.

After that, I became super paranoid about breaking things. I would be like, super careful with everything, even if it meant not enjoying myself. Like, if we were at the park and I wanted to play tag, I would be like, ""Uh, no, I don't wanna play tag. I don't wanna break anything."" It was like, this big deal in my head.

But then, like, last year, I was at my friend's house and I broke another vase. It was like, a total accident, but I was soooo embarrassed. And my friend was like, ""It's okay, it happens!"" But I was like, ""No, it can't happen! I can't keep breaking things!""

And that's when I realized, like, why my grandma was so upset. It's not just about the thing itself, it's about the memories and emotions attached to it. And I was like, ""Whoa, I get it now."" So now, when I'm careful, I'm not just being careful because I don't wanna break things, I'm being careful because I don't wanna hurt anyone's feelings.

And it's not just with physical things, it's with relationships too. Like, if someone hurts my feelings, I'm not",1,llama2_chat,Task: Write an essay exploring how our first impressions or memories of a significant event can shape our outlook on life and our future decisions.

93385DED39E7,"Hey, I'm just an average 8th grader, so bear with me! üòÖ

Distance learning, or online learning, has become a popular option for students in recent years. While some people think it's a great way to learn, others are not so sure. In this essay, I'll talk about the pros and cons of distance learning and how it can be beneficial or detrimental to students in different situations.

One of the biggest pros of distance learning is flexibility. With online classes, students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is super helpful for people who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas where traditional schools are hard to get to. For example, my cousin lives in a really small town and she can't get to school because of how far away it is. So, she takes online classes and can learn from home.

Another pro is that distance learning can be more personalized. Since students are learning online, teachers can give them more individualized attention and feedback. This can help students who need extra support or who are really advanced and need more challenging material. My teacher, Mrs. Johnson, is super nice and she always makes sure I understand the material before moving on to the next thing.

However, there are also some cons to distance learning. One of the biggest ones is that it can be really hard to stay motivated. Without the structure of a traditional school, it's easy to fall behind or lose interest in the material. My little sister, Emily, started taking online classes last semester and she said it was really hard to stay on track without seeing her friends and classmates every day.

Another con is that distance learning can be really lonely. Students don't get to interact with their classmates and teachers in person, which can make it harder to build relationships and learn from others. My best friend, Sarah, takes online classes too, but we don't get to hang out as much as we used to because of it.

In some situations, distance learning can be really beneficial. For example, students who are sick or injured can take online classes from home and still learn without having to miss school. Or, students who are traveling or living abroad can continue their education without having to switch schools.

D3612C6F0653,"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! üòÖ For this essay, I'm gonna talk about how staying active can be super beneficial for us. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

First off, staying active can help us avoid boredom. üò¥ When we're active, we're not sitting around twiddling our thumbs, and we're more likely to find things to do that are fun and exciting. Like, I know I get bored sometimes when I'm just chillin' at home, but if I go for a run or play a sport, I feel way more energized and engaged. Plus, there are so many cool activities to try, like rock climbing or dance classes, that can keep us on our toes. ü§©

Another benefit of staying active is that it can help us live a healthy life. ü•ëü•ó When we're active, we're burning calories and staying fit, which can help us maintain a healthy weight and avoid diseases like diabetes and heart problems. And the best part is, you don't have to be a total gym rat to stay healthy ‚Äì even just taking a walk or doing a quick workout at home can make a big difference. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Finally, staying active can help us achieve our goals. üéâ Whether it's getting better grades, making new friends, or just feeling more confident, staying active can give us the energy and motivation we need to reach our full potential. For example, I know some people who started playing a sport to improve their focus and concentration, and now they're doing way better in school! üìöüèÜ

So, in conclusion, staying active is super important for avoiding boredom, living a healthy life, and achieving our goals. üéâ It doesn't have to be hard or time-consuming ‚Äì even just taking a short walk or doing a quick workout can make a big difference. üåü So, let's all try to",1,llama2_chat,"Task:

AAD6A5CBDDB9,"The skill i have learned is playing fortnite, i started playing the game in 6th grade because some of my friends told me to play it and i was like ''ok i guess'' so then i downloaded the game. And i sent friend requests to my friends from school, when i playing with them i was the only one who just started.

I would just keep dying because i didn't know how to play, so what we would do we would hide the whole game and wait to the vary end to try to win. Then as time went by they added creative and creative was your own world you can join and do whatever you want, you could buildfight your friends or make teams or even do free for all.

And as time went by again i was getting better and told myself i want be really good at the game, so and i looked in youtube and it gave me so much information. I learned so much new things that i would practice in creative to try to learn them.

I would mostly look in youtube on how to do retakes, retakes are ways to try to get above a person without getting shot at. It would be really helpful but then my skill as a player was not getting better, because the only thing i would practice is build the right stuff. I would not be good ar editing or aiming, because i would never practice it. It took time to stay above the meta i just needed to find the right balance for all 3 major componets in the game.

Then people discovers new things like how to win fights and how to make smart moves and smart edits that can win you the game. what im just lacking as a player is making the smart dicisions, like when to rush a player and when to not but in my opinion there is always something to learn overall fortnite is one of my skills that took me time to learn.",0,original_moth,"Task:

0184ED9B19B9,"Imagine you are sitting on the bench as your team walks off of the field, their head's hanging low while the opposing team rushes to their star player hoisting the trophy up high. Picture yourself watching the head editor of the yearbook staff delete the layout and images that you spent hours perfecting, the votes for student council president being announced and seeing your name down at the very bottom with only a few votes. As much as administrators, coaches, teachers, and parents will tell kids over and over that extracurricular activities are an amazing experience, that is not always the case. Sometimes they are the root of not just physical pain, but emotional pain as well. An extracurricular activity is a personal choice that is extremely dependent on what goes on behind closed doors in a student's life. Requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity would not be beneficial to every student because it could interfere with family commitments, possibly exclude and limit kids who are struggling in school or those with special needs and disabilities, and create an overly competitive and hostile environment.

Many families, especially those with financial troubles, rely on their children to take care of each other¬†and the family as a whole. Requiring a student to participate in a very time-consuming activity on top of their pre-existing commitments to the welfare of their parents and siblings, in addition to homework can seriously damage their living conditions. In many cases the oldest child may have to pick up the younger siblings from school and watch them to ensure their well being. If you take away this student who is already taking on parental responsibilities, you could unintentionally cause a domino effect leading to the injury of a young child. When a family is struggling financially and one of their children is of working age, it is not uncommon for the teenager to begin working to try and gain more financial stability for their parents. Jobs and extracurricular activities are both very laborious¬†and time consuming. This combination of responsibilities and time commitments would not work whatsoever, leading the student to have to make a choice that they don't have in attempting to decide between supporting their family's income and a sports team. Almost every child growing up had chores. I know I do, and a lot of them at that. From cooking dinner when parents are working late, to taking out the trash, to cleaning up after younger siblings spill something, there is an endless list of chores in a child's daily life. The homework that is already assigned can sometimes make a student spend an entire night only focusing on the piles of worksheets and reading that they have to do. In many cases, this cramming of homework can result in the incompletion¬†of chores, much less having two hours of sports or yearbook after school as well. Adding even more time commitments onto the already packed schedule of a middle or high schooler is undoubtedly going to have severe consequences on family life.

By nature, extracurricular activities are competitive. Whether it's for a spot on the starting sports team, or one of the top editors in the yearbook, or the lead in the musical, or even the student council president, these are all competitions that extracurricular activities promote. These competitions may lead to a hostile environment inside the classroom or in the halls. Students can often go too far in competition, with both verbal and physical fights breaking out over some of the most trivial things. If we already have problems with hostility and people not understanding when they have taken something too far, how can we stop them from continuing this while essentially fanning the flame?

There is an extracurricular activity for everyone that can benefit them as well as leave them with good study habits, right? For students with learning disabilities and special needs, an extracurricular activity could become a nightmare in reality. Not only could physical disabilities impede a student's ability to play the sport that they want, but learning disabilities like dyslexia and ADHD can affect the student's ability to participate in some of the simpler stationary activities. If you look at the grade percentages in many schools, you can see that there is a large population of students that are seriously struggling in one or more classes, even with teacher's help after school. Studying for an upcoming test can be an hours long endeavor. Requiring a student to add a few more hours of extracurricular activities is ridiculous and can only have negative effects. Teachers are constantly preaching the importance of reviewing your materials every night and how you must complete all of your homework assignments in addition to unfinished classwork, but how can you do this if you barely even have time to sit down for dinner?

If we require students to participate in extracurricular activities, we are setting up multiple major issues like lack of time for family commitments, unintentionally putting students with special needs and learning disabilities at a disadvantage, and creating an overly competitive environment. While extracurricular activities can have benefits such as social skills and a healthier body, the risks associated with it outweigh the possibility of benefits for a smaller portion of the student body. We need to consider the effect on the smaller groups of people that are being put at a disadvantage before we make decisions with only a possibility of benefits. If we leave extracurricular activities as an optional choice, we eliminate the greater risk of social and mental health issues, exclusion of many different groups of people, physical fights, bullying, harassment, familial disarray, and many others.¬†¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,0
0FD81A828336,"We have lots of nieghbors close to us from space by that I mean planets. Earth, Venus, and Mars orbit the sun at different speeds. Scientist would mostly consider Venus because they feel like it is more controlable than Mars. On the planet's surface on Venus is that they have an average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and pressure 90 times grater than what we experience(paragraph 3). These are verry high temperature and pressure for humans to encounter on earth, even if humans ever went to live on Venus, such an environment would crush our society in the deepest parts of the ocean and would liquefy many metals(paragraph 3). Beyond that high pressures of heat impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface, such weather like that can kill more than one hundred humans a day. Scientist and astronomers said that, "" long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans, mountains, craters, an valleys just like earth""(paragraph 4). NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray, just imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 0r so miles above the landscape on Venus(paragraph 5).

2D47B736369E,"Body actions say more than words could ever say. This can simply be tested by taking a glance at any individual you may come in-contact with; almost immediately, our brains can process exactly how the other person is feeling. In recent years, this process we do ourselves, has turned to technology. Professor Thomas Huang from the Beckam Institue for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois has worked close by Professor Nicu Seb from the University of Amsterdam, to accomplish creating a computer program that can capture and explain human emotions. After some time, this work in progress became a reality, and was named the Facial Action Coding System. This invention has sparked interest in many different groups of people and in many varying fields of work. One of these fields is education. The Facial Action Coding System can positvely be used in the classroom to improve overall student experience by effectively and accurately catching a glimpse of their nonverbal communication in hopes to result in lesson plan alterations and opening prime opportunities for vulnerability in teacher to student relationships.

This new technology advancement has been found to provide very accurate results based on anatomy; therefore, would be sucessful no matter where it was used. Creator, Dr. Huang, definitely did his research when creating the Facial Action Coding System. The text reads, ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisley enough to convery specific emotions."" Based on this information, it is easy to see that our body language, and simple expressions are simply coded in our human anatomy; Da Vinci knew it and now so do many others. All of the human muscles work together to deliver our innermost feelings and thoughts. The text reads, Eckman has classified six basic emotions -- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness -- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" This information is essentially the way in which the Facial Action Coding System calculates human emotions in hopes to cause other people to potentially act differently. All humans use the same facial muscles, so this product can be effective on anyone.

Dr. Huang says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal...the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This piece of text is important to comprehend in order to fully understand the capabilities of the Facial Action Coding System. By using this structured and prepared system the results relayed back to an individual are extremely accurate. As a result of this accuracy, not only could the product be used anywhere; one of the most effective uses would lie in the classroom. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System uses a sytematic process to determine any individual across the world's emotions; which is an important piece of evidence because many individuals may not believe its' accuracy.

The Facial Action Coding System can effectively used in the classroom to adjust lesson plans based on student preference. One aspect, Dr. Huang mentions is the prevelance of nonverbal communication; especially for young children who are in the education system. He says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, includimg emotional communication."" This quote is significant when in the context of the Facial Action Coding System. Within the walls of a classroom this computer program could be used to dig deeper into a students emotions and feelings in order to understand them better and adjust to specific needs. For example, after using this program on a group of kids in the classroom; red flags may appear that gear toward frustration, stress, or confusion and this would give way for a teacher to step in and make a difference. If a large group of students were confused, the teacher would then know they may need to review the topic more thouroughly or by taking an alternate approach. If the computer system can reveal that a student is frustrated, the teacher would be able to console them positively in hopes they would be willing to take part in extra help or practice wihtin a subject. Dr. Huang also mentions, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student in becoming confused or bored."" As previously mentioned, by using the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher will be informed of the emotions and feelings of their students that they are unwilling to first hand share with an adult. Overall, this computer program would offer many positive advancements to the classroom that help teachers better prepare for individual student needs and preferences.

As the Facial Action Coding System could contribute to a teacher's knowledge of student reaction in the classroom, it could also make the classroom a much happier place by opening up chances for vulnerability and positive emotions. As previously stated, as a teacher becomes more aware of his or her students' emotions and takes practical steps towards fulfilling their individual needs; a door to vulnerability is quickly opened. Within the walls of a classroom, the relationship between a teacher and student is very important and can make or break a students learning for a short span of time. If the Facial Action Coding System was able to spot a negative emotion, and enable the teacher to step in and help the student walk through that struggle; vulnerability happens in the classroom and can make it a much better place to be. In additon the text reads, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" As the FACS enters into classroom usage, many students will become more aware of emotions they may be unable to verbalize. With this knowledge they may be able to better combat their negative body language and work on recognizing when their emotions may be going down a wrong path and be able to change it quickly. Just as that quote said, making a specific emotion may allow the individual to rapidly improve. Overall, the usage of FACS in the classroom would allow for students to have much more realistic and intentional relationships with their teachers and improve their emotions everyday.

All in all, the Facial Action Codign System is a computer system created that could have many important usages in the future. However, one of the most essential would be within the walls of a classroom. This opportunity would open many positive chances for emotions to be relayed accurately to a teacher in hopes that they would be able to alter lesson plans and change other aspects of their teaching style to better suit individual student needs. In addition, other studies and research completed with the FACS shows that this system can and will relay accurate results because body language is universal and our human anatomy does not lie. Lastly, allowing students to better understand their emotions will help them react to them before they may get out of hand. With early detection and acknowledgement of negative emotions the classroom could become a much happier place to be. This system is going to change the way many programs work, but mostly within the classroom. Teens emotions are always changing, body actions always say more than words could ever.

llama_70b_v1100,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a valuable tool for teachers. This technology can help teachers understand how their students are feeling and tailor their lessons to meet their students' needs. For example, if a teacher notices that a student is looking confused or upset, they can adjust their teaching methods to better help that student understand the material.

Also, this technology can help teachers identify students who may be struggling with a particular concept or subject. By recognizing the emotional expressions of students, teachers can provide extra support and resources to help those students succeed. This can lead to a more personalized learning experience for all students, which can ultimately lead to better grades and higher academic achievement.

Furthermore, the use of the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers create a more positive and supportive learning environment. By being able to recognize and respond to the emotional needs of their students, teachers can foster a sense of community and belonging in the classroom. This can lead to increased student engagement and motivation, which can also contribute to better academic outcomes.

However, some people may argue that the use of this technology in the classroom is an invasion of privacy. They may feel that it is not appropriate for computers to be monitoring the emotional expressions of students without their knowledge or consent. Additionally, there may be concerns about the potential for misuse or abuse of this technology, such as using it to punish or shame students for their emotions.

In conclusion, the use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a valuable tool for teachers. It can help teachers understand their students' needs, provide personalized support, and create a positive and supportive learning environment. While there may be some concerns about privacy and potential misuse, the benefits of this technology far outweigh the risks.",1,llama_70b_v1,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

D5FDDB4DFA82,"For most students, summer means the beginning of a much needed months-long break from school. For some, however, the stress of school never fades away. Some schools require that students complete assigned summer projects in order to continue learning, even when not in school. The importance of continued education is rarely argued, but the way some projects are planned out might not always result in engagement and time investment from the student. To combat this, schools should allow students to design their own projects. This would assist in motivating them to put their best work in, less stress upon the student, and helping them feel a sense of pride and accomplishment in their finished product.

As a student who has had to deal with a multitude of summer projects, I can say without a doubt that I have never looked forward to spending time out of my day to work on them. The most typical summer project given to me and most students has been summer reading. The books are almost always teacher assigned, subsequently tying them into their curriculum for the upcoming year. Before my junior year began, I was tasked with reading

In Cold Blood by Truman Capote for my English class. Personally, I enjoyed the book, but the project that went along with it was less than interesting. In turn, this led to me putting off my project until the last few days of my summer break, bringing along the stress of having to cram it in before the school year started. Since this project was teacher-designed, I also had to make sure to follow the strict guidelines in order to ensure a high grade when I turned it in to the teacher. If I was able to create my own project relating to the book rather than a teacher-designed project, I truly believe I would have enjoyed my finished product more than I did, along with eliminating the stress put upon me by the project's strict guidelines.

When a student is assigned a summer project, their immediate thoughts are almost always negative. This comes with the fact that they do not want to do work over their break, as this is one of the few times out of the year that they're allowed to forget about school for just one moment. Adding to this, if the student is given a teacher-designed project, this puts the motivation to do said project even lower than before. They know that they have no control over how their project turns out, as they often revolve around a fairly black-and-white rubric, resulting in a lack of diversity and creativity between each individual's project. If a student is tasked with the creation of their own project, however, this leads to a wide variety of exciting and new projects that vary from student to student, also placing motivation in their hearts to make the best project they possibly can.

Often after a teacher-designed project is finished, the only reaction of the student is relief that it's finally over. With teacher-designed projects, students often only work to completion, not to make a project they enjoy. However, if students are able to design their own projects, the reactions to their finished product would give them self-pride that they created what they believe to be their best work. For example, when I created a project after reading

The Road by Cormac McCarthy, I was able to look at my completed project with the feeling of pride and joy that I had truly created the best project I possibly could. The increase in moral for these students would give them a more enjoyable learning environment and the excitement of a new school year starting so that they're able to share their work with someone else who will appreciate it.

Many teachers would argue that the creation of student-designed projects would be unimportant to the curriculum, as they don't truly focus on something that needs to be taught. However, the importance of student-designed projects is to encourage them to be creative and to not be stuck in the mindset of just passing the class, instead opening their eyes to new ideas and allowing them to think outside the box.",0,persuade_corpus,,3

Which I don't think should be taken littralle, because they're own twins thanks to looks. Which is pretty segrgated, but oh well. So back on topic Venus is classified as Earth's twin, because Venus is the closest plant in density, size, and distance. Also did you know astromers have theory that Venus couldv'e been Earth-like. They're fascinated that Venus couldv'e been covered with ocean and couldv'e even supported life. The astrometer only belive this, beacues the features that are analogous to those on Earth. Venus has valleys, mountains, craters, and even a rocky surface. This really helped support why Venus is worth the risk, because look at all this inforamation we know. Yet, how are we suppose to belive it's true. You see humans are very heavy headed, which means we are not very open minded to knew idea. To contuie, people are going to fight weather it's true or not. Humans need to see it in order to believe it.

We need to head into this challnge head first and hope for the best. We need to stop being scared of the what if's and be more scared of that nots. Many reseachers are working on innovtion that can help us obtain the knowlege of Venus, which is such a succes. For example, NASA is working on an invention to help reseacher fload above the heated surface. On the other hand, forms of light can't penetrate dense atmosphere, which would be tough since Venus atmosphere 97% carbon dioxide. To contuie reseacher can't get rock,gas,or any kind of phyical samples, but that why we need to keep pushing. If we wanna find out Venus's secerets we need to get up close and personal despite the risks.

C4379D733479,"Limiting car usage has many advantages. The most important advantage is reducing pollution. Vehicles emit greenhouse gasses from their tailpipe. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse has emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"", as said in source one,

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

One of the main reasons the pullution is so bad in Europe is because of the diesel fuels. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average in the rest of Western Europe. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114, and London had 79.7. The numbers show that there is a direct correlation between the percent of diesel used, and the amount of pollution in an area.

Limiting car usage also helps cities grow. In Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed. Along with parks and sports centers blooming up, side walks have been replaced. Even new restraunts and shopping districts have been built. And on top of all this, traffic has been majorly reduced. As said in the exerpt,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , ""These people are generating a revolutionary change.""

Not only does reducing the amount of cars help the enviornment, it's better for your health. Pollution doesn't only affect the environment, it also damages the body. As the air gets polluted by greenhouse gas emissions, you breath in that air. And that contaminated air is the same contaminated air that is being cycled throughout our body. On top of that, reducing the usage of vehicles would force you to find a new way to get to your destination. You might resort to walking, jogging, bike riding, skating, or anything else you could think of. Limiting car usage would force you to excercise, which is obviously very beneficial to one's health.

Another advantage of limiting vehicle usage is the money that would be saved. Limiting vehicle usage would result in not buying gas as often. And as expensive as gas can get, that would would be a lot of money saved. If you went as far as selling your vehicle, there's even more money that you would benefit from.

So there are many advantages that result from limiting vehicle usage. For one, it reduces pollution, which is bad for the enviornment, as well as our health. Secondly, it would force us to excercise more. And lastly it would save us a lot of money.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
946D88B6450F,"Transportation has been a part of society for as long as the worlds been turning. It all depends what mode of transport you are willing to take on a daily basis. Cars are becoming fewer and fewer in some places of the past few years. People are less dependant on personal transportation which in turn creates a safer, healthier enviroment for ourselves and the others around us.

By limiting car usage the main reaction would be less pollution and less smog in largeer cities. Places like New York, Paris, Berlin, London, or Beijing could look so much better. Everywhere you look you see and hear about pollution and Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming. All this is caused mainly by humans hand and the cars we drive spitting out toxic Carbon Dioxide wastes. In Paris they had a one day ban of half the cars in the city and the smog went away in that amount fo time.(Source 2) If we limited cars we could unlimit our world to a new, longer lifespan, because cars are truly ripping our planet to pieces.

The chance of finding public transportation in America is very slim. Most places you go don't have subways or things like ""der U-Bahn"" in Deutschland. Our counrty is made for cars and we throw money at them every year which will eventually come to bite America in the butt. 80 percent of appropriations have gone to higways and the rest goes to other types of transport in America.(Source 1) By creating more viable public tansportation methods we could cut the spending on highways and put the money back into public transportation. By doing so we could limit accidents at the wheel and reduce pollution which I mentioned earlier. We already know that this system works in Vauban, Deutschland where residents rarely own cars and they live happier, quainter lives. (Source 1)

The time to by a car is not now. Recent studies show that car purchases, licenses, and driving has become fewer as each year goes on.(Source 4) Either from high vehicle and gas prices or an actual social spectical, driving is slowly decreasing all over the world. Hopefully within the next 25 years, public transportation will be a MUST in cities all over the globe, and I'm not just talking about buses. People are more reliant on planes and trains in Europe than any other continent. And we could benefit highly from what we learn elsewhere.

If we just join together and stop driving alltogether for just one day, the results would be both extraordianry and frightening. We have neglected to see that by not limiting our car usage we have limited our time on this planet. Hopefully our generation will correct the wronging of past generations and improve transportation so it isn't such a loud and obnoxtious hinderence.¬†       ¬†       ¬†    ",0,persuade_corpus,,6

I think Community Service is a good idea that students should be involved in.

It is a great idea. It could help everyone in the community live in a better environment.

Also, it could be fun and there could be many activities students would enjoy doing. And it could help the world be a better place.

The students, well some of them think that doing Community Service is a waste of their time. And that they would rather do other things that they enjoy doing.

And that they rather be with theirs friends and hang out. Students would most likely lie so they wont go.

Students could have many enjoyable activities they can do, while doing some of the Community Service things.

it could be a fun thing to do with their friends. Everyone can just hang out and do the Community Service. Students also think it is boring. But they could have a good time being with their friends and peers.

The Community Service program can also help the school. They can have more activities and field trips. Things that could be fun and make students have a good time with their friends. And it could be a fun yet educational school to be at. Once again I thinks this program is a very good idea. Thank you for your time. I really appreciate it.

8F40BA1ECB08,"Everyday, after school, I get my sister off the bus and watch her until my mom returns from work. I wouldn't be able to both do an extracurricular activity and watch her. Juggling both my own personal responsibilites and an extracurricular, on top of schoolwork, would be very stressful for me. I can't be expected to abandon by responsibilities for a school club. There are many reasons why I disagree with this dicision such as, people not being able to afford whatever they may be interested in, the students that stuggle with social anxiety and things lie it and the students who are already committed to something else after school.

One of the reasosn I disagree is that there are many actvities that would require money. There are students who are interested in these activities but won't be able to afford it. Those people who aren't able to afford it shouldn't have to pick something else just because they don't have the money. I know many kids who would be interested in sports but aren't able to pay the fees and by things like cleats, mitts, bats etc. Other actvities may do competitions which also require fees for them to be able to compete in them.

Secondly, there are many kids who struggle with social anxiety and other mental related things that could stop them from participating. Staying safe is a school rule and that rule doesn't go with just physical saftey but it also means that students should be and feel safe mentally too. Pushing them to do this could cause them to have an axiety attack or effect how they're dealing with their anxiety. Forcing a person that doesn't feel comfortable in social situations to participate in a group club is disregarding their feelings and their feelings should be taken into account.

Lastly, students may have their own responsibilities outisde of school. There are people, like me, who help watch their younger siblings after school. There are students who have a job that they have to go to work at school. Many people who go to our school already feel stressed trying to maintain good grades in the classes that their taking. Making a student do an extracuricular activity will just add to the stress that they may already be dealing with which can effect their emotional, mental and physical state.

In conclusion, my opinion is that students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities. This shouldn't be a \ the principle is allowed to decide due to everyones personal reasons for not being able to do it. The reasons that could cause people to not partcipate, are that people are struggling with mental things like social anxiety, there are kids who can't afford the things they're interested in and that some students already are commited to something unrealted to school. I think that these things should stop the principal from making this decision.¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,1

This can lead to higher grades as members can offer assistance and spot each other's mistakes. Friendships can also develop from working collaboratively. On the other hand, working alone allows for the development of independent and self-reliance skills, as well as time to really devote to mastering a particular topic or skill. However, it can be hard to find inspiration and motivation when working by oneself, and grades may suffer due to lack of peer review. Ultimately, when it comes to studying, both working in groups and working alone have advantages and disadvantages and can both lead to academic success.",1,chat_gpt_moth,"Task: Explore the advantages and disadvantages of working in groups versus working alone at school.

D8CF376FEE74,"As we get older we want to travel to more places and get there faster, what if their was a quicker way without using cars. Certain places have been introducing a new concept, they calll themselves suburban pioneers. They live in places that have little or no cars, besides for the occassional bus, and all the stores that they would normally drive to are much closer now. Their are many benificial points to this new way of life such as a dramatic drop in greenhouse gasses, a stress free way to live, and also who doesn't desire to save a buck or two. If people start to limit the usuage of cars this planet might actually become a safer more joyful place to live.

In the past years greenhouse gasses have skyrocketed. The ozone layer is now trapping car exhaust fumes in earth and leading to what some might call global warming. Summer becomes hotter and longer, vice versa with winter. The U.S alone is¬† to blame for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emission. In europe it's 12 percent which is still quite a grave deal. Causes of not cutting back on the use of cars leads to tragic events such as the one that unfolded in Paris. Thier was so much smog in the air from motorized cars that for five days no one could start their cars unless they had a wish of paying a pricey fine. If people start to diminish the use of cars we can restore this humble planet to its former glory.

Forking out money for a car and having the luxory of fixing it up everytime a piece falls off or something malfunctions can become expensive quite rapidly. Who doesn't crave to save money anyways? Those who have chosen the suburban pioneer way of living have saved enormous enough of money. They don't have to pay for the insurance of the car and they don't have to pay to fix up the ole' rust bucket. Though some would rather have a car, but those who drive do the honors of car pulling which might not be the most time saving mechanism but in the long run it truely is beneficial. Also the government gains from all this. The government pays to build highways and roads for your car, but if cars aren't so common as time goes by roads get shorter and people start to get paid more because of all the money that the government is saving. Though money can't make us happy is still is an important piece to own in life.

In retrospect cars cause a lot of stress related problems. Everyone has one of those days where they wake up late and then suddenly remember that they have to get across town in a few minutes. Yes a car could get you there in less than no time, but wouldn't it be much simpler if you could just walk a closer distance. With the desecration of cars, stores and outlets would be much closer to your home. The stress of forgetting something at home and then having to drive 30 minutes to go get it would be diminished. Families could have more interaction with each other which means a closer bond could be formed. Receting the number of cars wouldn't be such an inhuman thing to do if you knew that the outcome was far more appealing.

To sum up, limiting the number of cars that roamed this earth would be more of a gain than a loss. Cars create hazardous gasses that are released into the air that are slowly but surely rendering us useless. Cars also cause safety hazards that can lead to a stressful environment. Plus if you don't use a car as often or get rid of it all together you can retain money for more important matters such as bills for your house or maybe a well deserved vacation. The posibilities are endless if we begin to limit the use of cars.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,6
EBCC0B6D36D0,"As the world continues to develop and evolve, the need for reliable and steady jobs is becoming increasingly apparent. It is difficult to overstate the importance of these jobs in providing people with a living wage, stability, and a sense of purpose. However, technology continues to revolutionize society, impacting our ability to gain and adequately perform these jobs.

On the plus side, technology has made it much easier for individuals to access job information and market themselves to employers. Job listings can be found all over the internet for those looking for certain types of opportunities, making the process faster and more efficient. Additionally, job seekers can use online tools such as LinkedIn and Indeed to create professional profiles and network with potential employers.

At the same time, technology has made certain types of jobs obsolete. Automation has displaced manual labor and workers in many fields, and as technology continues to advance, more jobs will be replaced by machines. While this can lead to increased efficiency and a better-functioning economy, it has also caused a great deal of anxiety and insecurity.

In the end, it is clear that although technology can make it easier to find and perform jobs, it also has the potential to displace workers. In order to maximize the benefits of technology while minimizing its drawbacks, people must be mindful of the need for job security. This means investing in training and education as well as taking measures to ensure that jobs are safe and equitable.

83810CEDAE01,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explained many reasons why studying Venus would be helpful and advantageous to us as humans and scientists. Especially since Venus is the planet most like Earth, this would benefit Earth's knowledge at how we could study and explore Venus and grasp the research it would reveal. In Paragraph 8, the aouthor wrote, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value..."" This quote means that Venus is valuable, yet challenges face the journey.

In Paragrpah 4, the author compared how Venus was like Earth a long time ago. The author described how Venus seemed to possess analogous features to our planet, like valley, mountains, and craters, except the long time frames to Venus are a crucial consideration. "" The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable...,"" though in Paragraph 5 the authour explained how NASA had a possible solution for the problem of traveling safely and Venus's hostile conditions.

NASA introduced an idea of a blimp-like vehicle hovering over Venus; the vehicle would remain floating above Venus's surface to remain away from the storms. Even though Venus has unavoidable dangers, for exmaple, the erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes explained in Paragraph 3, we will come prepared for the challenge.

Paragraph 7 states that NASA is working on different approaches as to how to study Venus so far off the ground. Safe in the hovercraft and away from the high pressure and heat and sporadic lightning strikes, scientists discoverd there was no possible way to collect the samples of rock, gas, or any component of Venus without getting out. The scientists sought to conduct a mission to bust the bubble of safety dispute the risks. Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide were tested to have withstood the chaotic surface of Venus for up to three weeks. Mechanical computers would also serve an important role now, just like in the 1940s, by making calculations with gears and levers that do not require electronics at all.

Overall, the point made across by the author of this passage was that even though studying Venus will definitely bring problems and challenges, there are loopholes and many ways to solve the solutions. Science is worth the risks, especially since it is for our planet and can better our understanding, so finding ways around the problem, and even facing them head on are our only solutions better comprehend Venus, and other planets in our solar system as well.

B5618012B782,"Influence plays a significant role in our lives, and it can be positive or negative. The type of influence we have on others can affect how we perceive the world and our future goals. In this essay, I will explore the different types of influence people may have on their lives and how they can positively influence others.

One of the most significant influences we can have is making smart decisions. When we make informed decisions, we can positively impact our lives and the lives of those around us. For example, if we are in a relationship and we make the decision to communicate openly and honestly, we can strengthen our bond and influence those around us to do the same. Additionally, if we make smart financial decisions, such as saving money and investing wisely, we can positively impact our future goals and influence those around us to do the same.

Having friends with similar interests is another type of influence that can positively impact our lives. When we surround ourselves with people who share our values and interests, we can learn from each other and grow together. For example, if we have friends who are passionate about fitness, we can motivate each other to work out and make healthy choices, which can positively impact our physical and mental health.

Setting a good example for others is also a type of influence that can positively impact our lives and the lives of those around us. When we set a positive example, we can inspire others to follow in our footsteps. For example, if we are a successful student who works hard and achieves their goals, we can inspire others to do the same. Additionally, if we are kind and compassionate towards others, we can positively impact the world around us and influence those around us to do the same.

In conclusion, the type of influence we have on others can positively impact our lives and the lives of those around us. Making smart decisions, having friends with similar interests, and setting a good example for others are all types of influence that can help us achieve our future goals. By being a positive influence, we can make a difference in the world and inspire others to do the same.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,2

BBFEBE9529A1,"First impressions are a critical aspect of human interaction. They are the initial perceptions that people have of each other, and they can greatly influence how they interact with each other in the future. First impressions can be formed based on a wide range of factors, including appearance, behavior, and personality traits. However, the question is whether first impressions can be changed or if they are set in stone.

From my personal experience, I have found that first impressions can be changed to some extent. For example, when I first met my best friend, I was initially hesitant to get to know them. However, as we spent more time together, I began to see a different side to them, and my initial impression was slowly changed. This experience taught me that first impressions are not always accurate, and that people can change based on their experiences and interactions with others.

Additionally, research has shown that first impressions can be changed through conscious effort. For instance, studies have shown that people can change their body language and tone of voice to make themselves appear more approachable and friendly. This can help to counteract negative first impressions and create a more positive one.

However, while first impressions can be changed to some extent, they are not always completely changeable. For example, in the case of animals, first impressions can be based on physical characteristics such as size, shape, and color. Once an animal has formed a first impression of a person, it can be difficult to change that impression. For instance, a dog may be wary of a person based on their size or appearance, and even if the person tries to change their behavior, the dog may still be hesitant to interact with them.

In conclusion, first impressions are an important aspect of human interaction, and they can greatly influence how people interact with each other in the future. While first impressions can be changed to some extent through conscious effort, they are not always completely changeable. It is important to be aware of first impressions and to strive to create a positive one, as this can help to build stronger and more meaningful relationships.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,9

FC79A84D783B,"The Electoral College has its pros and cons. Either keeping the Electoral College or changing it to election by popular vote for the presidents of the U.S. will have its disadvantages and advantages of course. So, why keep it if the people don't actually pick the president?

One of the reasons why the Electoral College should be changed is because its not Democratic. The voters don't vote for the president, they actually vote for a slate of electors who are the ones who elect the president. ""Because of the winner-take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states"" - by Bradford Plumer. Its not fair that some states won't even have a saying in choosing the president. Everyone should have a saying even if the candidates in the winner-take all system don't want to spend their time. We live in a democratic country we should be allowed to choose the persident instead of the Electoral College. Its unfair and irrational that the electors choose the president instead of the people.

The Electoral College does help the elections avoid Run-Off Elections. Larger states will always get more attention in a campaign than a small state. This is because larger states have a bigger population than small states.""The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"". -by Richard A. Posner. Just because not everyone pays close attention to the competing campaign. It doesn't been they shouldn't be treated differently than the ones who do. Everyone should be treated equally no matter what there opinion or choice is.

My opinion about if we should keep or change the Electoral College is biased. I don't think we should keep or even change it for the president to be elected by a populr vote. The electoral college helps weight the political balance in large states. It also doesn't allow the people to vote for the president. Either way i would be fine with whatever decision happens to the electoral college. I can't chose a way to argue about it cause i go both ways with my arguements.

In overal the Electoral College has its advantages and disadvantages. It all depends in everyones point of view. People should be treated equally about the decision they made. Let the people be able to choose the president of the United States its a right they have don't take it away from them because it wouldn't be fair to them.

793517BB1BB3,"In the life today, education is important for people, and an options of choosing school or places to learn are also make people thinking. From what I heard on the news, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But, is it truly helpful for student? or it is just the way to comfort student, so they can stay home and do whatever you want to do without the administer from the teacher.

First, when we talking about schools, we are also talking about our future, this is really important more than anything. If we¬†come to school everyday we¬†will get a punch of information and ideas for our self, we could meet other people, contact with them and make friends. In that way, you will never feel stressful or stuck instead of staying home and do your own work.

Second, even though school are welcome you to come, but somehow the weather, the distance or something about personal that make you not able to come to schools, and the better options for you that are stay at home and learning from online or conferencing. For me, if I have a chance to choose between two options, I will choose to be in class, not attend classes from home, even though something will clog me, I will still want to come to schools. For example, if I spend in schools I could know a lot of things than I stay and take classes at home, I will meet my friends and my teacher everyday, we will discus about stuff at school, joining some club to reduce stressful after schools. And if you decide to take classes online, it is not bad, but for me it is not helpful. You better to go to school, you have to contact with other people, having conversation and discus with each other. You have the right to choose your own options. But be active, don't be passive.

Third, dispose your time is the best way to live. If you can walk, you able to go to schools, so the option attend classes at home is not for you to choose, it is not benefit for you, I am just agree with the people who not able to move or stuck of something about personal to take classes at home, in that way, they can get information and study like other people. So I think that is fair for everyone, don't just give student an option like that and it will turning them to be lazy, busy working or don't have enough time in schools. If necessary, student can take online after schools to complete anything they miss.

Finally, I think we should put the option about the classes online for only the people who are not able to go any where, not for normal people. In that way we can balance between these two, and every student can study in the better way.

In conclusion, benefit or not benefit are depend on you, for me the option to take classes at home¬†is not benefit, because I always want to come to schools everyday to get experience for myself, to get new things and meet new people. And you should go that way like me, we young and we hold our future in our hand, don't just stay passive.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,8

Electoral College means that voters are putting lots of trust into electors in making the right decision and that always doesnt turn out the way people want them nto turn out. Lets go in details in why I'm not in favor of keeping the Electoral College in this position.

The

Electoral College consits of electors who's role is to vote for the president in favor of there representative. To me that's not fair for two main reasons. One being that people of America should all be able to vote under their own opinion according to freedom of speech which was explain in one of the Amendments. We dont need a group of ""special"" people to vote for us. We're an independent nation which also means that we are independent ourselves. The second one being that we cant control who the voters are which means that we cannot trust that the voters are making the right decision. We pick our president because we trust in the president's decisions and actions. Like it says in Bradford Plumer's article in

The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong , ""Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the elctors in the first place? It depends on the state."" Electoral College depends on systems and not the nation's people which is not fair in voting for our President of the United States.

People may say that there are though benefits in having an

Electoral College by stating that the representatives who are runnning for president are choosing trusted people who knows that they will make the right decision and also that if there was to ever be a dispute over the

Electoral College , it wouldn't be a big major one but on the other hand if it was to hand it off to the regular citizens, then it would be a major problem bigger than the dispute of the

Electoral College . In Richard A. Posner's articlecalled

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method in choosing the President , it says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a mojority of the votes cast."" I believe this is a fair statement because people would think that the majority of the vote will automatically be given to that representative to be President of the united States¬† but thats not tru according to the

Electoral College . The have electors and there Electors can just flip that decision upside down and it would be the opposite representative who would get the vote, but then again the eletors of the

Electoral College can be the opposite of your favor. So at the end of the day it comes down to what you believe is the right decision and the right decision for me is to remove the

Electoral College even if it has to mean war for the sake of our country.

In Conclusion, I'm not in favor of keeping the

Electoral College senator for all these debates againts the

Electoral College

I believe is stronglt true. What do you think Senator? The decision rest in your hands.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,5
DD91A86810BD,"Enthusiasm and motivation are two critical factors that drive success, even in the face of failure. They are the driving forces that keep individuals going, even when they encounter obstacles and setbacks. In this essay, I will explore how enthusiasm and motivation fuel success, despite failure, by examining examples of people who have achieved success after failing.

Firstly, enthusiasm is a powerful force that can drive individuals to achieve great things. It is the spark that ignites the flame of motivation and gives individuals the energy to pursue their goals. For example, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, faced numerous failures before achieving success. He failed at his first startup, Zip2, and later at X.com, but his enthusiasm for innovation and technology kept him going. He continued to pursue his dreams, and his hard work and dedication eventually paid off. Today, he is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world.

Similarly, motivation is the driving force behind success. It is the force that keeps individuals going, even when they encounter setbacks and failures. For example, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, faced numerous rejections before finding a publisher. She was rejected by numerous publishers, but her motivation to tell her story kept her going. She continued to write and refine her work until she found the right publisher. Today, the Harry Potter series is one of the most successful book series in history.

In conclusion, enthusiasm and motivation are two critical factors that fuel success, despite failure. They are the driving forces that keep individuals going, even when they encounter obstacles and setbacks. Examples of people who have achieved success after failing, such as Elon Musk and J.K. Rowling, demonstrate the power of enthusiasm and motivation in driving success. By maintaining a positive attitude and a strong work ethic, individuals can overcome failure and achieve great things.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,3
F2ADCA41BC30,"Dear, Principal

I think you should make it mandatory for your students to perform community service. It would benefit the community with your students helping out and may change several students. Most students don't do anything important after school or on there free time so it would give them something to do and it would be helpful to everyone. Just think about it which one do you think would be better for a student to do, tutor children or sit and watch television all day. Community service would only take a few hours giving them enough time to complete their home work and giving them time to do whatever hobby they enjoy. It would be better for them to help the community because it would make the community a better place. With people helping out especially with students, most likely they will learn something from their experience helping out the community. Since their are a lot of students their would be a lot of people helping out. It would help out and give the students something to do, consider adding community service to your school.",0,persuade_corpus,,4
D830F531C366,"It is the first week of school and the principal has just announced that starting this year every student will be required to participate in an extra curricular activity.

Everyone is groaning and complaining about how they don't have time and clubs are stupid, but this rule is actually a very good idea. It is smart to require students to participate in an after school club or sport because students will probably enjoy the club they choose to participate in. In addition, extracurricular activities are vital to a students' future and motivate them to do better in school.

If students are required to choose an extracurricular activity they will most likely enjoy the club they choose. If students are allowed to pick their activity instead of someone else picking it for them, they will enjoy it more. They will pick something they are interested in and want to spend time doing. With mandatory participation in clubs, students will have more time to hang out at school with their classmates while doing things they all enjoy. This can give them time to socialize when they are not supposed to be focused on class. In addition, some students don't feel safe at home and prefer school to their home situation. Requiring participation in clubs gives these students a safe place to be in the afternoons and mornings.

Extracurricular activities will benefit a students' future in many ways. Many clubs that students can join provide them with useful job skills such as working to a deadline and working with technology. Some of these skills would not be provided in a classroom setting and certain extracurricular activities would provide more in depth experience with these concepts than would be provided in a classroom. Students can also learn how to work with others even if they are working someone they do not usually work with or someone who they do not want to work with. This is something that they will need to learn how to do regardless of the job they choose. These activities also look good on college applications and resum√É¬É√Ç¬©s as it shows colleges and employers that someone is well rounded and participated in many activities.

Participating in clubs and sports at school will motivate students to perform better in class as well. Many activities require that their members maintain an acceptable grade average. This can encourage students to bring their grades up so that they don't miss out on their club. Many clubs will teach students to work hard whether they like what they are doing or not. This ability is likely to be used on schoolwork as well.

In addition, students in clubs can help each other with homework and study together. Studying with another person is proven to raise test scores.

Extracurricular activities make kids happy, make their schoolwork better and are vital for their future success. While some might say that requiring participation in these activities limits the amount of time that could be spent on schoolwork the actually commitment would minimally affect the amount of time spent on school work. The commitment for some activities could be as little as 1 or 2 hours a week and students can decide what kind of commitment they want to make. In truth, the benefits of these activities for student far out way¬†the costs. This is a great rule for middle and high schools and if your school does not have a similar rule then go to an administrator and try to make it a rule because it will be extremely helpful to the students at your school.",0,persuade_corpus,,1

I think driverless cars are the way to go because, car accidents are a large cause of deaths in countries like the US where there are many. Diverless cars could potentialy cut that down if not eliminate it. The google cars have suppossedly driven more than half a million miles without a crash and are still out there, which is enough evidence to show that it could definately save lives.

Driverless cars must be the better way to go due to the fact that it eliminates many of the variables that make driving as humans, diffucult. It would take out the nessesity to sleep for the automated car and could run long distances without haveing to stop and rest, which would also be good for delivery companies to start taking advantage of. Computerized cars could even be programed to be able to comunicate with each other leading them to be able to sycronize their paths and speeds and reduce even more risk for everyone. Despite how the laws may look at it automated cars could be safer without a driver than with one. It would even use less fuel to operate, with an integrated efficency system. With the technology that is avalible it may even be possible to soon run a computerized car on solar power and take out the fueling proccess entirely.

Automated cars could also become so much more than just a vehicle, it will have lots of technology onboard as well as a powerful computer. Just the addition of the computer could provide many more possabilities and have many more powerful aplications than your tablets or your smart phones. These cars would also be a luxury I don't think these cars will be cheep but may become easier to obtain later on just as most technology. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2

Stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. Cars also cause pollution, which can be deadly to the enviorment. Cars can create smog which could be prevented by having one car free day. People who have cars also are more stressed than those without cars. A car free city would most likely see parks and sports center bloom throughout the city and uneven pitted sidewalks replaced by broad smooth sidewalks. Rush hour restrictions would dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

Americans would save so much money if they didnt buy a car. It seems as americans are buying less cars each year. Bill Ford laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. Changes are being made by people to limit the use of cars and its a great idea.

Have you ever seen an alien in real life? do you belive that an alien has seen a human before? At first NASA

thought it was just a martian mesa that made it look like a eygptian pharoah. Afer a couple days had past we unveild the image wo the whole would could see the photo. When the image was seen by people the caption under image was "" It ewsembles a human head, with eyes, nose, and mouth.''

When the picture was uploaded a website it was revealing a natural land form and no alien monument after all. Since the image was uploaded not everyone was satisfied. Skeptics, still beleve that alien was hiddenby haze. To prove skepicts wrong MGS went for a second look. When they went they captured an extraordinary picture of ''Face'' for the second time.

DE56AA9B4BF1,"Dear School Board,

I am writing to you today to propose a new idea that I believe will greatly benefit our school and its students. I am advocating for the addition of one and a half hours to the school day. I understand that this may seem like a drastic change, but I believe that it will have a significant positive impact on our students' academic performance and overall well-being.

One of the main reasons I believe this change would be beneficial is that it would give students more time to learn. With the current school day, students are often rushed and have to fit in a lot of information in a short amount of time. This can lead to a lack of comprehension and a feeling of being overwhelmed. By adding an extra hour and a half, students would have more time to absorb the material and ask questions if they need to. This would ultimately lead to better academic performance and a more confident learning experience.

In addition to giving students more time to learn, this change would also give them more time to use their time wisely. Many students today are constantly glued to their phones or other electronic devices, often wasting valuable time that could be used for studying or engaging in other productive activities. By adding an extra hour and a half to the school day, students would have more time to focus on their studies and engage in activities that would benefit them academically and personally.

Finally, I believe that this change would also improve students' understanding skills. With more time to learn and engage in productive activities, students would be able to better understand complex concepts and ideas. This would ultimately lead to a more well-rounded education and a better understanding of the world around them.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the addition of one and a half hours to the school day would be a positive change for our students. It would give them more time to learn, use their time wisely, and improve their understanding skills. I urge you to consider this proposal and make a decision that will benefit our students and our school as a whole.

F5BC1532013D,"In recent years, the use of online video conferencing has become increasingly popular for students attending classes from home. While there are many advantages to this method of learning, there are also some disadvantages that must be considered. In this essay, I will examine the advantages and disadvantages of students attending classes from home via online video conferencing and analyze whether or not students would benefit from this opportunity.

One of the biggest advantages of attending classes from home via online video conferencing is the flexibility it provides. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own home, which can be a huge advantage for those who have busy schedules or live far away from their school. This flexibility allows students to balance their studies with other responsibilities, such as work or family obligations.

Another advantage of online video conferencing is the ability to work and study at the same time. With online classes, students can multitask and attend their classes while working on other projects or assignments. This can be a huge advantage for students who struggle with time management or who have a lot of work to do outside of class.

However, there are also some disadvantages to attending classes from home via online video conferencing. One of the biggest disadvantages is the lack of teacher guidance. In a traditional classroom setting, teachers are able to provide immediate feedback and support to students who need it. With online video conferencing, students may have to rely on email or other forms of communication to ask questions or seek help.

Another disadvantage of online video conferencing is the potential for distractions. When students are attending classes from home, they may be more likely to be distracted by other activities or people in their household. This can make it difficult for students to focus and stay engaged during class.

In conclusion, attending classes from home via online video conferencing has both advantages and disadvantages. While it provides flexibility and the ability to work and study at the same time, it can also lead to a lack of teacher guidance and potential distractions. Ultimately, whether or not students would benefit from this opportunity depends on their individual circumstances and needs. It may be worth considering for some students, but not for all.",1,llammistral7binstruct,,5
38FC87B30D30,"A future when no one has to drive sounds almost to good to be true. Cars that can drive you where you want to go and then move on to the next passenger would save time and resources. But can they eliminate the human driver without causing unforeseen problems? Although driverless cars may be helpful far off in the future, the cars do not have the interpretation skills or laws they need to be safe and effective.

As nonrenewable resourses diminish and people become busier, the market for new driverless cars will expand pushing the automotive industry to come up with driverless cars. Cars that can pick up passengers and take them where they need to go will help use less fossil fuels. After dropping off their passengers, they can pick up new passengers decreasing the time they are traveling without anyone in them like taxis and would, according to Sergey Brin, ""use half the fuel of today's taxis"" (1). Also, for busy people they would decrease driving time allowing for the passengers to work or relax during their trip. With all these benifits, people wonder why we do not have driverless cars already.

Even with the positive possibilities of driverless cars, they should not be put into mass use because they lack the interpretation skills needed to drive on the roads which could cause wrecks and lead to miscommunication with others on the road. All of the sensors crammed into these cars do a great job collecting information for the car, but the car can not interpret its surrounding the way a human can. If the car ever runs into something it has not been programmed to react to it will either stop causing a major backup or go right into the hazzard, creating a wreck that other cars may run into. Humans, on the other hand, can react to the things they have never seen before and do what is nessisary to avoid a wreck while keeping traffic flowing. In a future with driverless cars, if there are still cars with human drivers, how will they communicate. Even while using the rules of the road, what if someone ways on another person and the driverless car thinks it can go. Misscommunication could be deadly, which makes one wonder about what laws would be in place for diverless cars.

The laws for driverless cars are not to the point they would need to be for these cars to run freely on the streets. The courts would be a mess of owners and manufacturers placing fault on each other. As the author points out, if there is an accident, ""who is at fault"" (9). If you get rear ended by a driverless car, do you collect the money from the manufacturer or the owner of the car? These laws would have to cover both driverless cars hitting driverles cars and regular cars. The time to make all these laws will take quite awhile and then have to be edited as situation arise that had never been considered before. In addition the laws to create one massive driverless car fleet for everyone to use would take years of planning. Can you use a car to get to florida? What if you need to haul animals somewhere or spill a drink in the driverless car? All these answers will have to come before a fleet of driverless cars.

While driverless cars could be benificial, they have a long way to come in interpretive technology and laws before they can come onto the streets. In the future as driverless cars get more technology and laws made for them, they may be useful, but right now they are only a thing of the future.    ",0,persuade_corpus,,1
A135E9280900,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

There has been a lot of controversy on weather to require all children of SCHOOL_NAME to perform community service and although this would be good in some ways this would be worse for many reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home.

My first reason is that forcing children to work on community service is that it takes time away from extra curricular activities. It's a common known fact that America has problems with obesity. Making kids do community service would definitely take time off of children's clock that they could be doing active activities like working out or playing a sport. This would increase obesity rates in America even more, causing the life span of children in this Country to shrink.

My second point is that forcing children to do community service makes it seem more like work, rather than if you didn't it would seem like something you do for fun, like a hobby. Community service is something that should be done because kids want to help other kids, the environment or those who need help. This wouldn't only make the amount of work done plummet, but also the quality of the work. If a kid is performing community service and is really enjoying himself, he is much more likely going to get a lot done and it is going to be very good quality work.

My third, and final point is that forcing children to perform community service is taking time away from children's school work or studying at home. There is no doubt that children in this very room that I'm writing this paper in are struggling to pass the 8th grade. Forcing them to do community service would only increase the number of failing students at SCHOOL_NAME. This would not only be problematic for the children that are failing, but would also hurt this schools' reputation of having good academic program.

In conclusion forcing children to perform community service would be problematic for three reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home.

I think that all students need to do something that helps the community. Whether it is picking up trash or helping other in their work. If all the students do a community service, the community will be cleaner and better. There would be little or no trash on the streets. People could help other people with work.

It might take up some time, but it will help the community. Some work doesn't take very long either. If you decide on picking up trash it will only take twenty minutes. If you tutor a student it will only take one hour. Community service is not a waste of time. It will help a lot of people.

If we would not have community service, the streets could be filled with garbage. There could be students that don't get help in their homework. That could cause them to get out of school and not want to learn. Those kids could turn out having a bad life.

There are no reasons to oppose on community service. bad things could happen without it. So I think that every student needs to perform a community service. It will help the community and the students. It will also help the people living in the community. Things will be better in the community.",0,persuade_corpus,,0
EC1D25B7A42E,"Students will benefit from having the option to attend classes from home. There are several schools that offer the choice to learn from home and students have been able to benefit from it. Allowing students to have a choice in their education offers relief from forcing them to learn a certain way that brings them discomfort. Some may believe that offering distance learning is an awful idea because it keeps students from society, and while that may be true the option offers a unique way of learning. Students should be able to attend classes from home because it offers a comfortable environment for them to learn in, it gives them another way to learn, and it prepares them for a possible future.

While learning students should feel comfortable in the environment they are in and doing it from home allows them freedom from other outside pressures. Allowing students to attend classes from home removes stress from having to do assignments in a rush; however, there are certain programs that do have time limits for assignments, some give students a leeway to do them. For example, my cousin felt stress and discomfort at his school with the way he was learning, so my family moved him to online learning at home, and now he is in a better environment to succeed in his education. Some may believe that the way someone learns has nothing to do with their environment, and while it might be true, we can see how students can be affected by observing them. Furthermore, certain environments give prime examples of how comfort affects the way students receive knowledge.

In the world some people are not provided with many choices in how they want their life to be, so offering the option to students is a pleasant idea. Some children in other parts of the world do not get to have a choice in how they receive an education, so giving the option does matter. Each student perceives knowledge in a different way and because the world is changing with technology and the internet, attending classes at home by the way of online or video conferencing does not sound like such a horrific idea. There are people who do not like the idea of changing the way students learn because they are terrified of change, so offering the choice is a problem to many. Others have the belief that giving the choice to students on how they want to learn is an amazing idea because it allows them to have a say in how they want to go about their education.

One last benefit of allowing students to learn from home is that they will be prepared for the future if they decide to pursue a job or career that makes you work from home. While students are learning at home, they are also getting the experience of working at home and developing skills for the future. Although there are people who have the belief that working from home isn't actually a job because you aren't considered to be working; there are plenty of examples of people who work at home and have made successful careers from being at home. Plenty of people have made incredible careers from the experience of learning at home, so it is a possibility for those students who get the chance to learn at home. Students will have a chance to be prepared for a possible future if they so desire while getting a different learning experience from it all.

In conclusion, students will benefit in different ways from being offered the option to attend classes at home. Schools are allowing students to have a say in their education which is what matters because choices are considered to be something important. Attending classes at home allows students to have an option in the way they receive knowledge because it could be a fun, unique, and new way of learning for them. While students will be in a pleasant environment, will be given a choice, and will be prepared for something in a near future. Furthermore, changing the way students learn will be a key part in the future when everything changes with time.",0,persuade_corpus,,8
3069CFB48737,"When someone needs advice, they seek help from their friend, family member, and many more. Sometimes, they only talk to one person, and maybe don't get much help from that one person. But when you get advice from multiple people, you mostly get the advice you need and want. Getting advice from multiple people is better than talking to one person.

Getting advice from other people is better than just having one person talk to you. When you're in a bad situation, obviously you need advice. Just talking to one person would not be helpful.

It's common you get good advice thats pretty helpful, but some are more deep and have a lot of thought. Many celebrities often give good advice and that are meaningful. There are some quotes and phrases from famous people throughout history that also have deep meaning. You never know what advice you get might change you. It's important to always get the advice you need and listen to different opinions because you never know that it could change your life.

Often throughout time and life, many people get advice. They seek out multiple advice so they could get the best help. There could be many advice that could be deep and have meaning. If you need advice, get the most out of it and get plenty. Eventually, you will need it. By getting multiple thoughts and opinions, it would be the best for you and a lot to think about. Getting multiple opinions and advice, will help you to make the right decision.¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,4
36403757FA10,"Dear senator of Florida, I personally feel that the electoral college is just plain unfair. I don't think it's necessary to even have it at all because what's the point if the votes aren't equal for all states? it's a very irrational process. It isn't right if a president wins the popular votes but doesn't win by electoral votes and it results in him/her not becoming president. If someone votes for a slate of electors and they end up not even voting for who they're ""supposed"" to be voting for then what's the purpose of electing them anyway? There is no purpose unless you want the other party to win which i highly doubt that. The electoral college affects the voting of states because if the majority of their state is republicans and they're democratic, there vote isn't really going to matter because majority wins. This process makes no sense to me.

The amount of electoral votes that your state gets depends on your states population and not the size of it. I somewhat understand why they do this but at the same time it doesn't seem very fair. Yeah, i know life isn't fair but for something like this that has a possible way of being fair doesn't make sense not to be. Alaska with only 3 electoral votes should be able to have the same amount as california with 55 electoral votes. Since it isn't actually equal like that i feel that they should just choose who wins and becomes president by popular votes. This way would be a lot more fair because it wouldn't actually matter how many people lived in your state, it would just matter how many people voted for which canidate.

Another reason electoral votes aren't right to me is because if a president wins the popular votes but not the electoral votes then it almost seems likes one of the types of votes is useful. It seems like this because then he/she may not win and become president even though they won the popular votes. The canidates shouldn't have to rely on 2 different types of votes because obviously one isn't fair. I feel that in a situation like this having popular votes is just a watse of time because it seems that the electoral votes are what matter the most. Not having an equal amount of electoral votes for each state really defeats the purpose.

The voting is done by the party's nominee that then elects a slate of electors to vote for the canidate but the problem is you can't always trust that they will actually vote for the canidate that they're supposed to be voting for. This isn't the only issue, sometimes the voters get confused and accidentally vote for the wrong canidate resulting in more votes for the opposing side. This is a another reason why i feel that the electoral college should be abolished for good.

In conclusion, the electoral college is just really not needed in our goverment. It is equal for all states which affects the vote. Also the canidate doesn't win based on only popular votes, they must win they majority of the electoral votes. Lastly but definetly not least, the voting by the slate of electors isn't certain and isn't always accurate. These are some of the main reasons why i feel that the electoral college should be left in the past as an anachronism.

Generic_Name tells his mom in a monotone voice, ""Mom the veterinarian¬†said that Generic_Name only has three days to live."" As Generic_Name's mom's tone changes she say's ""What happened to her, is she okay?"" ""The doctor asked if I wanted to put her down because her death might be painful,"" Generic_Name explains. Generic_Name's mom tells Generic_Name, ""It would be the best if you put her down."" Generic_Name hangs up after not hearing what he wanted to and calls his dad, ""What's up buddy,"" his dad say's, but as Generic_Name tells him the new's his dad is silent not knowing what to say. Generic_Name's dad tells Generic_Name to call the¬†veterinarian¬†and ask what percentage Generic_Name had to live. Generic_Name get's back on the phone with his dad he says, ""They said only twenty percent,"" Generic_Name's dad says ""What the heck, let her try to fight it out.""¬†When asking people for advice, they sometimes talk to more then one person, because they have a difficult choice to make, they need a new prospective, and they are bad decision makers.

A lot¬†of time's people have a really hard decision to make and need people's advice. This is something millions of people experience every day. An example of this is when us eighth graders had to make choices about what we did or didn't want to have in our schedules,¬†when picking out our schedules. I'm sure that we all got advice via teachers, parents, or older sibling, we all had tough decisions to make that would effect our future. Know think of¬†Spiderman¬†Homecoming, a movie that came out a few years ago. Peter Parker, aka¬†Spiderman,¬†had the decision at the end of the movie to become an Avenger, but Peter Parker learning from his experiences and what others told him decided that they are right and he is to young to become an Avenger, so Peter¬†politely¬†declined. Know you might say what if the people helping you make these tough¬†decisions¬†tell you to do something stupid? What is say to that is that you just have to have some¬†common¬†sense¬†so that stupid people don't ruin your life and use the advice of other people.

Most people only think one way and have a hard time finding another solution, because they can only think of their solution, that is why it is important to get other people's prospective. As you are playing soccer with your buddy's one of your friend's pull's a muscle and you incest that you call an ambulance. Your other friend's are not thinking like you, and tell him to rest and drink water because its not that serious. In that incest¬†you would have wasted a tone of money and wasted an ambulances time by making it come checkout your friend, that would have happened if you didn't have your other friend's who had a different prospective then you. Know by now you have probably watched Avenger's Endgame and in that movie everyone had a different prospective. Ironman had moved on and Captain America had joined a group to talk about the people they missed, but everything changed when Antman returned and had a different¬†prospective and had the idea to build a time machine. Know you might say what if every one in your group thinks like you and has the same prospective. What I say to that is that is impossible and even if it happened then go find someone, somewhere else who thinks differently.

People can be bad at lot's of things and one of those things is making decisions. In the episode ""Hurricane"" of the show American Dad, Stan, the dad of the family, makes bad decision after bad decision making things worse and worse. Stan makes his family stay in there house during a hurricane and then the streets flood, later Stan let's a shark into the house and even make's worse decision's later in the episode. So as you can tell Stan isn't the best decision maker and need's other people's advice. A lot of the time professional¬†athletes make bad decisions and one of the most recent athletes to do this was Antonio Brown. He had a great job and was probably the best receiver in the NFL at the time, and then he lost it because he started making bad decisions, such as recording private locker room meeting's and tweeting very disrespectful thing's. These bad decisions ruined his career and if he just talked to someone and talked it through he might have gotten some sense knocked into him.

Two month's have past since the veterinarian said that Generic_Name only had three day's to live and she is still alive. ""Hello Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name's friendly neighbor say's as Generic_Name exits his apartment to go walk his dog. Generic_Name respond's happily, ""Hi how's your day been,"" Generic_Name waiting joyfully for a response. ""It's been just fine thanks for asking Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name's neighbor say's as Generic_Name say's his goodbyes so he can go enjoy this wonderful¬†day with his lovely dog that is still alive thanks to the advice he got from the people around him.¬†When asking people¬†for advice, they sometimes talk to more then one person, because they have a difficult choice to make, they need a new prospective, and they are bad decision makers.   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†",0,persuade_corpus,,1
72732FD01203,"""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"".

In my opinion, I agree with this quote because, if you do not try to do better everyday, you are not going to reach your purpose. When you have the experience, on doing something you have to keep doing it, and you will improve each day. If you keep working on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on, it will make you grow. The more things you learn the more prepared you will be in your life.

My first reason that support my response, is that if you don't keep trying to do better everyday, you are not going to complete your goal. If you keep trying your best and doing what you like to do you will grow each day. Its important that you try your best everyday not only you will grow in your life but you are going to make yourself proud as well. For example, some people have their goals but they don't try their best.

My second reason that support my response is that when you have the experience on doing something you most keep doing it, and you will improve each day. Every time you try to improve, its a good opportunity for you to grow. The experience you have will make your future better. If you work on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on it will make your life easier. The more you work on something the fastest you will see the different in your life. For example, in my experience every time I know how to do something and I keep practicing, on it I get to improve myself.

My third reason that support my response is that the more things you learn the more prepared your will be in your life. If you try to learn more things and not just stay focused in just one thing will make you to be able to grow. Everyday you most have the purpose of learning new things. Learning new things each day, makes a person specialized and all the things you know. For example, in my experience when I try to learn more about something, its easier for me to talk about it.

To conclude, I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement. The more you know about something, the best future you will have. If you focused on doing good everyday you will grow. Trying to do something you have experience with will make you grow. Working on your purpose will make you have a better life.",0,original_moth,"Task: Write an essay agreeing with the quote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.""

0340D60B3722,"I most defintely agree with the scientists behind the Facial Action Coding System. By having the ability to read a student's emotions the world of education could make huge strides. By simply altering a lesson to fit a child's personality, the lesson could become more enjoyable and less challenging for the child.

Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" If Dr. Huang is in fact right about his technology's potential, children all over the world could become better educated. From my own personal experience I know that when the lesson deals with something I am less interested in I become bored, but if the lesson metions something I enjoy, then it becomes ten times easier.

Dr. Huang also says that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This is one of the most important lines in the article. By saying this, Dr. Huang opens up a world of oppurtunities for his technology. Many teachers around the world would agree that their students when talking, commuicate more with their emotions than physical words. These teachers would be able to know how their entire class was feeling as soon as they walked in. This would enhance the teacher's teaching style for the day ,and increase the students learning oppurtunity.

Dr. Huang's final arguement is also very important. He says when reffering to nonverbal human communications that, ""Computers need to understand that to."" Dr. Huang believes that computers must learn to read the human emotions, and I agree. This generation is becoming more and more about technology, and most schools have converted completely to technology based schooling. If every school had the ability to use the Facial Action Coding System, the intelligence of this generation and generations to come would continue to grow exponentialy.

The Facial Action Coding System, is a huge new technology that would make huge improvements to classrooms. Its ability to recognize emotions would not only benefit students, but would benefit the teachers of those students.

A975CBC4A7E8,"Online schools have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many people choosing to attend them instead of traditional schools. While there are certainly advantages to attending an online school, there are also disadvantages. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of attending classes online as opposed to traditional schools, as well as the impact on academic success and parents.

One of the main advantages of attending an online school is the flexibility it offers. Unlike traditional schools, which have set schedules and locations, online schools allow students to attend classes from anywhere with an internet connection. This means that students can attend classes while working or taking care of their families, which can be particularly beneficial for those who are juggling multiple responsibilities. Additionally, online schools often offer a wider range of courses and programs than traditional schools, which can be particularly advantageous for those who did not finish their studies or who are interested in pursuing a particular field of study.

Another advantage of attending an online school is the ability to learn at one's own pace. In traditional schools, students are often required to keep up with the pace of their classmates, which can be challenging for those who learn at a different pace. With online schools, however, students can work through course materials at their own pace, which can help them to better understand the material and achieve their academic goals.

Despite these advantages, there are also some disadvantages to attending an online school. One of the main disadvantages is the lack of face-to-face interaction with instructors and classmates. In traditional schools, students have the opportunity to interact with their instructors and classmates on a regular basis, which can help to build relationships and provide support. With online schools, however, students may feel isolated and disconnected from their instructors and classmates.

Another disadvantage of attending an online school is the potential for distractions. With the flexibility that online schools offer, students may be tempted to procrastinate or get distracted by other activities. This can lead to a lack of focus and a lower quality of work.

In terms of the impact on academic success, attending an online school can have both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, the flexibility and ability to learn at one's own pace can help students to achieve their academic goals. On the other hand, the lack of face-to-face interaction",1,llammistral7binstruct,,9

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and to advocate for its preservation for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue in favor of changing to a system of election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides several crucial benefits that should be considered.

Firstly, the Electoral College system guarantees the certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, which has the potential for disputes and claims of tampering, the Electoral College results are more definitive. As seen in the 2012 election, President Obama received a significant majority of the electoral vote compared to his share of the popular vote. With the winner-take-all system in place, each state's indivisible electoral votes create a clear winner and reduce the likelihood of a tie. This certitude ensures a smooth and decisive election process.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters a sense of representation for all regions and states. A candidate must have trans-regional appeal and cannot solely rely on regional favoritism to win the presidency. This requirement encourages candidates to campaign across the nation and listen to the concerns and interests of voters from different regions. By ensuring that no single region has enough electoral votes to guarantee a win, the Electoral College promotes a more balanced representation for all areas of the country.

The system also incentivizes candidates to pay attention to swing states. While critics argue that this leads to campaigns focusing solely on these states, the fact remains that swing states receive the most attention and information from candidates. Voters in these states become more engaged and thoughtful in evaluating the candidates' policies and promises, knowing that their votes will play a crucial role in deciding the election. This engagement and informed decision-making should be considered valuable aspects of the Electoral College system.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a balance to the political weight of large states. In a popular vote system, candidates would likely concentrate their efforts on densely populated areas with larger voter bases. However, with the Electoral College, states of different sizes and populations are represented more equally. This ensures that candidates must consider the interests of both large and small states during their campaigns, preventing the neglect of smaller states' concerns.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This situation can lead to prolonged and complicated election processes. The Electoral College, on the other hand, consistently produces a clear winner, reducing the strain on the electoral system and providing a smoother transition to the next administration.

While critics claim that the Electoral College undermines the importance of individual votes and discourages participation, the data suggests otherwise. Participation rates in presidential elections remain high, with approximately half of the eligible population casting their votes. Voters are motivated to express their political preferences, rather than merely relying on the belief that a single vote could decide the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers essential benefits that should not be overlooked. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes nationwide representation, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of large states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. These advantages support the preservation of the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States.

I respectfully urge you to consider these points when evaluating any proposals to change the current system. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,radek_500,,9

94131A88E955,"Year-round education and the traditional school approach are two different ways of educating students. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to consider these when deciding which approach is best for our education system. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of year-round education versus the traditional school approach.

Year-round education is a system where students attend school for a longer period of time throughout the year, typically 12 months. This approach has several advantages. Firstly, it allows for more consistent learning throughout the year, as students are not interrupted by long breaks. This can lead to better retention of information and a more focused learning experience. Additionally, year-round education can provide students with more opportunities to learn and grow outside of the classroom, such as through internships, service projects, and extracurricular activities.

However, year-round education also has some disadvantages. One major disadvantage is that it can be stressful for students and teachers. With a longer school year, students and teachers may feel overwhelmed and burnt out. Additionally, year-round education can be expensive, as schools may need to hire additional staff to cover the longer school year.

The traditional school approach, on the other hand, is the standard model of education where students attend school for a set period of time, typically 9 months, followed by a summer break. This approach has several advantages. Firstly, it allows for a break from formal education, which can be beneficial for students' mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, the summer break can provide students with an opportunity to catch up on any missed work and to pursue other interests outside of the classroom.

However, the traditional school approach also has some disadvantages. One major disadvantage is that it can lead to a decline in learning retention, as students are not in the classroom for a full year. Additionally, the summer break can be disruptive for students, as they may forget what they learned during the school year.

In conclusion, year-round education and the traditional school approach each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Year-round education can provide more consistent learning and opportunities for growth outside of the classroom, but it can also be stressful and expensive. The traditional school approach allows for a break from formal education and can lead to better learning retention, but it can also lead to a decline",1,llammistral7binstruct,,9
2bf52db3,"Cars are useful machines that get you around. But what you may not realize is the many problems that they may cause. The emissions from car tailpipe can cause environment issues and pollute the atmosphere with greenhouse gases. Some advantages from limiting car use include environmental improvements and recreational and personal advancement. Reducing car usage would be a benefit to most cities.

The atmosphere has been at an all time high in pollution, smog and green house gases are effecting cities. In Paris, France nearrecord pollution has been occurring and Paris decided to enforce a partial driving ban to help clear the air of the city. According to the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog. Coldnights and warm days caused the warm layer of air to trap the car emissions into the atmosphere. In Bogota, Colombia there is a declared day without cars in the capital city of 7 million people. According to the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, the turnout was large and even the rain wouldn't stop them from participating. Carlos Plaza which was interviewed for the article stated ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Using less cars will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants according to Elisabeth Rosenthal author of ""The End of Car Culture"". Overall limiting car use will be a big factor in conserving resources and lowering emissions.

This limitation of cars would be beneficial to personal and recreational purposes also and not just the environment. In the town Vauban, Germany 70 percent of families do not own cars. According to the article ""Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, citizens claim to be happy this way. ""When I had a car I was always tense. ""I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter. In this new approach of limited car use, stores are placed just a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. This provides an easier way to get what you need in a fast and convenient manner. In Bogota, Colombia, parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city and sidewalks are being replaced, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. A network of public transportation could be created to save time and improve safety. Reducing car use creates an opportunity for more recreational buildings and stores to be created near your community for your benefit.

Reducing car use would be a huge environmental benefit, helping lower the amount of smog and carbon emissions. This would also create the opportunity for recreational and business improvements, which would help create new shopping districts and recreational buildings closer to your community. In general limiting car use would create a cleaner and safer environment but would still be able to provide you with new entertainment and a stronger local community.",0,train_essays,,5
0ACB0E08934E,"The ""Facial Action Coding System"" is technology that can be used in the class room because some people can't figure out how good or bad someone is feeling. Teachers will be able to know if the student is learning or eithor not paying attention or sleeping in class. It'll be easier for them to know what's false and what's true expression in their situation they could be in.

In difference in the situation students can't understand someone's expression. Thanks to the technolgy now it'll be easier to figure out students emotion or anyone. The article states, "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.""""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.""

Finally, yes the technology is worth a big margin but its worth to have the help we can all get to help us know many. In my opinion it'll be a better way to learn/read better on our emotional expressions because you""'ll have more information and could know more about everything you want or need to know about the expressions. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day, for instance, you can probably tell how a person is feeling simply by the look on their face.           ",0,persuade_corpus,,0
F5AF8BD99F29,"Dear, School Board

I would personally like to thank you for taking the time out of your very productive day to read my letter. My name is Generic_Name I go to Generic_School in Generic_City. And i believe that students should take classes at school instead of online because. If a student needs help they can ask a teacher, cheating would increase dramatically more than it already has and there would be a increase in procrastination.

I am a student who in the classroom doesn't always catch on quick so this first point is going to be personal. If the school district decides to move classes online not only I but hundreds of other kids would struggle to keep up. And when we're doing online classes from home there is no teacher. or extra help it is soley depended on us to do the work. Students also do better with human interaction instead of a computer telling you to ""repeat the question if you do not understand"".

Another reason why doing school work online rather than a classroom is a bad idea is because of cheating. Cheating is already a big problem in this day of age with online resources such as: photo math, mathway. com and websites where you pay people to your work for you makes it way to easy to cheat. And cheating is bound to sky rocket when students cant get help from teachers they will resort to cheating or anything of that matter just to pass. I know for a fact if my grades were low and there was no other options i would cheat myself. But there will be no need for that if we just keep doing what we've been doing and learning the ciriculumn in a classroom with human interaction.

My final and last point is procrastination. Procrastination is something that is very common nowaday's. it is when you put something off to the very last minute. Now you're going to tell me that out of all the students in stafford county school system that not one individual is going to procrastinate. Say a student is having trouble on his or her online work and and they want to take a break for a couple hours. Well those hours could turn into days and those days into weeks all because they couldnt finish there work. We are in a age where technology is fascinating and entertaining espicially to teenagers in particular with Xbox and Playstaion and just having a phone in general that could cause procrastination. If students feel as if they are not getting there work done or they're not getting a subject they're just going to procrastinate or cheat.

In conclusion online classes would only hurt the school system and just produce bad habits. And those habits will go down the road with students in future jobs and businesses. Once again i would like to thank you for reading my letter.

Sincerely, Generic_Name",0,persuade_corpus,,1

Since Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size, the distance are similar too. This planet has different speeds. Though, humans have sent many spacecrafts to this dangerous land. Each mission was unmanned sicne no spacecraft ever survived the landing for a few hours.

Some dangerous this planet planet presents are, the atmosphere is thick and is almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide. The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere and the conditions are more extreme than human encounter in Earth. ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solor system, even though Mercury is closeer to our Sun""(Paragraph 3). It has so much heat and pressure and the weather presents additional dangerous which are, erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and excesive amount of lighting strikes.

This dangerous can really affect humans and humans won't really be able to survive in that planet. Scientists believe Venus was once covered largely wiht oceans and could of supported forms of life. Since scientists are now able to knwo more about technology and ivent new spacecrafts. We now have new information of the Planet Venus. Now, we know it's surface is rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

In conclusion, I think the more we learn the more we can be able to experience more things and have more knwoledge. Technology has been playin a big part of this situations and expriences. The more technology advances the more we will be able to exprience more. ",0,persuade_corpus,,2
F4E879AE7FBA,"The greater danger for most of us is setting our aims too high and falling short because many people try to aim for something that's imposible for them to accomplish, falling short on your goal will make you want to give up, and not having the motivation and energy will get you no where.

Most of us should set a realistic goal for them to aim; but sometime we aim too high and set an impossible goal that we can't accoplish it.

For example: some people aim to be perfect; but that's imposible because no one is perfect.

Some people will do so much work for no reason because if they don't have the materials or a plan for that impossible goal th,en they're wasting their time.

The danger of this is that no one will accomplish a single goal if they're aiming to high.

Many people try to get the results that they want; but many fall short.

Falling short on a goal can be a big danger, because it could lead many people to calling themselfs a failure.

This can also make people want to give up on what they were aiming for.

Everyone wants to be successful in life and not a failure, because if you're a failure, then you'll face many challenges and suffer.

Many successful people in the world accomplish their goals because they have the motivation and energy on doing better; but many people don't have a motivation or energy that they get no where in life. Motivation and having energy are some keys that can help people aim for something big and be albe to accoplish their goals.

Another way people can aim big or be successful with their goals is if they have a positive mind set.

The great artist Michelangele once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""

Setting your aims low and achieving your marks is not the great danger or a danger. However, setting your aim too high and falling short is a great danger because you can learn from it.",0,original_moth,"Task: Research and analyze the life and success of Michelangela and his quote, ""The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""
